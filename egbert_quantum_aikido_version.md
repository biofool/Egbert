## Words of the Founder

*"The Art of Peace is medicine for a sick world. There is evil and disorder in the world because people have forgotten that all things emanate from one source.*

*There is no enemy in love. There is no discord in love. Aikido is the realization of love.*

*The secret of Aikido is to harmonize ourselves with the movement of the universe and bring ourselves into accord with the universe itself.*

*I want considerate people to listen to the voice of Aikido. It is not for correcting others; it is for correcting your own mind. This is Aikido. This is the mission of Aikido and should be your mission."*

**— Morihei Ueshiba, O Sensei**  
**The Founder of Aikido**

## Introduction: The Energy of Story

This story, like energy itself, transforms with each telling. Just as water can be ice, liquid, or steam—all the same essence in different forms—this tale appears differently to each generation while carrying the same truth: conflict is energy waiting to be harmonized.

In the quantum world, observing something changes it. As you read this story, you're not just watching Egbert's journey—you're participating in the transformation. Every child who hears this tale adds their energy to it, creating new possibilities.

## Chapter 1: When Energy Gets Stuck

It was Friday, and Egbert could feel the energy rushing through like electricity with nowhere to go. "Why did my parents name me Egbert?" The frustration buzzed inside, building pressure like steam in a kettle.

Egbert noticed how the teasing at school made everything feel tight—shoulders up by the ears, stomach twisted, breathing shallow. The energy that usually flowed freely now felt stuck, turning into anger.

"The next person who teases me is going to regret it," Egbert thought, not realizing that resistance creates more resistance, like pushing against a wall that pushes back harder.

---

## Chapter 2: The Rush

Monday at lunch, the energy storm began. Two kids walked by Egbert's quiet corner.

"Egg Salad!" one called out.

"Yolk-bert, because Egbert is yellow!" added the other.

"If I had a name like Egbert, I'd change it."

Then came the words that broke something open: "What's your mother's name? Chickenbert?"

Egbert felt the rush—that surge of energy that floods the system when we're threatened. But instead of breathing and grounding, instead of feeling where the energy wanted to flow, Egbert let it explode outward.

*WHAM!*

Before anyone could think, Egbert had knocked the bully to the ground. Both children stood stunned, feeling the shock waves of misdirected energy ripple through the playground.

---

## Chapter 3: Energy Attracts Energy

The principal understood something important: calling names creates energetic wounds just like hitting does. Everyone stayed after school—Egbert for hitting, the others for using words as weapons.

Walking home alone, Egbert discovered a law of energy: what we put out comes back multiplied. The two kids from lunch were waiting, and they'd brought a friend. The one Egbert had hit had a black eye—visible proof that force creates equal and opposite force.

Egbert's heart pounded like a drum, sending waves of fear-energy through every cell. Running seemed the only option, but the footsteps behind grew closer.

A hand caught Egbert's shoulder. Trapped between three angry kids, Egbert felt the energy building to dangerous levels. The one with the black eye pushed hard with both hands. Egbert fell.

---

## Chapter 4: The Harmony Appears

"STOP IT!"

The voice carried a different kind of power—not force, but presence. Everyone turned.

Standing there was someone about Egbert's size, maybe a little bigger but definitely smaller than the bullies. They stood in a way that seemed both relaxed and ready, like a tree that bends with the wind but doesn't break.

"Get lost!" one bully yelled, trying to push them away.

But instead of resisting or fighting back, they simply turned like a wheel, guiding the bully's own pushing energy into the ground. The bully found himself sitting on the pavement, surprised but unhurt.

They stepped back, taking a deep breath that seemed to calm the very air around them. "Leave in peace," they said. Not a command, not a plea—an invitation.

But the bullies' energy was still chaotic. Another grabbed their arm.

With a movement like water flowing around a rock, they turned in a circle, ducked low, and guided this bully to the ground too. The bully yelped—not from injury, but from surprise at finding himself suddenly seated.

---

## Chapter 5: Energy Transforms

The three bullies looked at each other, then at Egbert (who was standing now, feeling strangely calmer), then at this mysterious defender. Their confused energy swirled for a moment, then found its outlet—they ran.

"Thank you," Egbert managed.

"I'm Stevie," the defender smiled. "What's your name?"

As they walked, Egbert told the whole story, noticing how Stevie listened with their whole being—not just ears, but heart and center too.

"How did you do that?" Egbert finally asked.

"I study Aikido," Stevie explained. "It's a Japanese art that teaches us to harmonize with energy instead of fighting it. Like when someone pushes you—if you push back, you're doubling the conflict. But if you blend with their energy and redirect it, the push becomes a dance, and the conflict dissolves into harmony."

"It's like what happens with electricity," Stevie continued, warming to the subject. "When you ground electrical energy properly, it flows safely. When you don't, you get dangerous sparks. Aikido teaches us to be good conductors of life energy."

---

## Chapter 6: The Dojo - A Laboratory of Energy

Stevie glanced at the sun. "Oh! I'm heading to class now. Want to come?"

At the dojo (which Stevie explained meant "place of the way"), Egbert learned the first lesson: respect creates an energy field of safety.

"We bow when entering," Stevie demonstrated, "not because we have to, but because it helps us shift our energy from the rushed outside world to the centered practice space."

They bowed to a picture of an elderly Japanese man with eyes that seemed to sparkle with joy and strength.

"That's O Sensei—Morihei Ueshiba—who created Aikido. He discovered that the same force that keeps planets in orbit can help people orbit around conflict instead of crashing into it."

---

## Chapter 7: Learning to Flow

Sensei (which meant "one who has gone before") welcomed Egbert warmly. The class began with everyone sitting in stillness—not empty stillness, but the kind full of potential, like the moment before lightning.

They practiced breathing: not just moving air, but feeling how breath connects the inside world to the outside world, making them one.

"When we get angry or scared," Sensei explained during the centering exercise, "our energy rises up and scatters. We lose our center—not just in our bodies, but in our minds and hearts too. Centering means gathering all that scattered energy back to our core, like how a star's gravity holds planets in orbit."

Egbert watched the students practice rolling—not falling, but flowing with gravity instead of fighting it. When someone lost balance during a technique, they didn't crash; they rolled like a wave and came up standing.

"In Aikido," Sensei said, "we don't see mistakes as failures. Every fall is a chance to practice recovering our center. Every attack is an opportunity to practice harmony."

---

## Chapter 8: The Quantum Pause

Over the summer, Egbert trained twice daily, learning what Sensei called "the Quantum Pause"—that moment between stimulus and response where choice lives.

"Between when something happens and when you react," Sensei taught, "there's a tiny space. It might last only a fraction of a second, but in that space, infinite possibilities exist. That's where you choose: will I add more chaos to the conflict, or will I transform it into harmony?"

Egbert practiced this with grabs and punches, learning to feel the attacker's energy and blend with it rather than clash against it. Like two rivers joining instead of two rocks colliding.

The hardest lesson was randori—multiple attackers. "When surrounded by chaos," Sensei said, "don't try to control everything. Find your center, stay present, and let the energy show you where to flow. The universe is always whispering the answer; we just have to quiet down enough to hear it."

---

## Chapter 9: The Return

Fall came. First day of school. The three bullies spotted Egbert immediately.

They approached with the same aggressive energy as before, but something was different. Egbert felt the rush—the same electricity as always—but now knew what to do with it.

*Breathe. Ground. Center.*

The energy that wanted to explode outward instead sank down through Egbert's feet into the earth, like lightning finding ground. In that centered state, Egbert could feel something else: the bullies' energy wasn't really anger. Underneath was hurt, fear, confusion—all twisted up with nowhere to flow.

"I understand now," Egbert said calmly, meeting their eyes without challenge or submission. "When people hurt us, that hurt-energy gets stuck inside. If we don't know how to transform it, we pass it on to others. That's what I did when I hit you—I passed my hurt to you instead of transforming it."

The bullies stood frozen, like their internal circuits were recalculating.

"I'm sorry I hit you," Egbert continued. "Not because I'm weak or scared, but because adding violence to violence just creates more violence. Like noise added to noise just makes everything louder. I'm learning a different way now—turning conflict into connection. Maybe we could try that?"

---

## Chapter 10: Energy Seeks Harmony

One of the boys approached Egbert the next day. "What happened to you? You're... different."

"I'm learning Aikido," Egbert explained. "It's teaching me that we're all made of the same energy, just flowing in different patterns. When we fight, we're really fighting ourselves."

Within a week, all three boys came to watch class. Sensei welcomed them warmly, understanding that bullies are just people whose energy got twisted by pain.

"Can we join?" they asked after watching.

"If your parents agree and you come with sincere hearts," Sensei replied, "you're welcome. But understand—Aikido isn't about becoming stronger than others. It's about becoming strong enough to choose harmony even when it's hard."

---

## Chapter 11: The Unified Field

As weeks passed, something remarkable happened. The boys who had been enemies became training partners. Not instantly—there were moments when old patterns tried to resurface, when the stuck energy wanted to explode the old way.

But Stevie and Sensei watched carefully, and a single look could remind everyone: we're all in the same energy field, affecting each other with every thought, word, and action.

During Egbert's first test, something beautiful occurred. After demonstrating techniques that showed how far the journey had come, Egbert brought two flowers to class.

One went under O Sensei's picture—gratitude to the source of the teaching.

The other Egbert offered to Stevie—gratitude to the friend who showed that strength and gentleness are not opposites but partners, like in-breath and out-breath, making life possible.

Stevie accepted the flower with a bow, then surprised everyone with a hug. "You understand now," Stevie whispered. "Aikido isn't something we do. It's something we become."

---

## Chapter 12: The Ripple Effect

The story doesn't end there, because energy never really ends—it just transforms.

The three former bullies became some of the dojo's most dedicated students. They discovered that the energy they'd been using to hurt could be redirected to heal, to protect, to create harmony.

Egbert learned that every interaction is practice. Every moment of frustration at the name "Egbert" became a chance to practice acceptance. Every conflict at school became an opportunity to practice the Quantum Pause.

"Remember," Sensei would say, "in quantum physics, observing something changes it. When you truly see someone—not their surface anger but their deep need for connection—you change the possibilities. You collapse the wave of potential conflict into a particle of peace."

And the ripples spread. Other kids noticed the change. Teachers noticed. Parents noticed. Like stones dropped in a still pond, each act of harmony created waves that touched distant shores.

---

## Epilogue: The Continuing Story

Years later, Egbert would become a teacher too, sharing the lesson learned that difficult day: 

*We are all energy beings in an energy universe. Every conflict is energy that hasn't found harmony yet. Every enemy is a future friend whose energy is temporarily flowing against ours. Every moment of violence is a missed opportunity for transformation.*

*The sword that cuts things together is sharper than the sword that cuts things apart.*

*This is the way of Aikido. This is the power of harmony. This is how we transform not just ourselves but the world—one interaction, one breath, one choice at a time.*

## Practice Guide for Young Aikidoka

### The Quantum Pause Practice
When you feel angry or scared:
1. Stop (even for one second)
2. Breathe deep into your belly
3. Feel your feet on the ground
4. Ask: "How can I transform this energy into harmony?"

### The Energy Check
Several times a day, notice:
- Where is my energy? (Head? Chest? Belly?)
- Is it stuck or flowing?
- Is it scattered or centered?
- Can I breathe and let it settle like sand in water?

### The Harmony Game
When someone is upset with you:
- Don't push back (that doubles the conflict)
- Don't run away (that leaves the energy unresolved)
- Stand centered and really see them
- Look for the hurt under the anger
- Offer understanding instead of opposition

### Remember:
- You are made of the same energy as stars
- Every conflict can become connection
- Strength means choosing peace when you could choose force
- The universe is always showing you the harmonious path—you just need to quiet down enough to feel it

*"In Aikido, we don't see others as enemies to defeat but as energy to harmonize with. This is how we create a beautiful world—one interaction at a time."*
