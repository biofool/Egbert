## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### Why Most Book Launches Fail
• **Stop at launch day** (Track C fixes this)
• **No email list** (Tracks A+C fix this)
• **No controversy** (Track B fixes this)
• **Single channel dependency** (Track A fixes this)
• **No bulk sales strategy** (Tracks B+C fix this)

### The Compound Effect
• **Track 0 alone**: 500 sales
• **Track 0 + any one track**: 1,500 sales
• **Track 0 + any two tracks**: 3,000 sales
• **All four tracks**: 5,000+ sales + coaching business

### Final Recommendation
**Start all four tracks simultaneously but with different intensity:**
• Track 0: 100% effort (foundation)
• Track C: 80% effort (sustainability)
• Track A: 60% effort (platform diversity)
• Track B: 40% effort (asymmetric bets)

**Rationale**: Track C's extended timeline and community building is the hidden brilliance—most launches peak 30-60 days AFTER publication, not on launch day. The Harmony Challenge creates engaged practitioners, not just readers, leading to coaching revenue that dwarfs book sales.
