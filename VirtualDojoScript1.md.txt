thing that happens and I think we get the same thing in class sometimes when um, everybody kind of Tunes in together in their nights where that and I'm sure it affects what you're doing as a teacher yeah everybody at a similar level then we can present better at that level and hopefully get everybody because they're not everyone's at a much better level move them into a much, better level yeah it does facilitate uh as opposed to them being all over the board yeah, uh it's much better there together somehow yeah I used to do a practice in San Francisco uh during the winter time and I found out that if the students ran around the mat, that the building would get warm really fast so like you said just to warm up the dojo the dojo but I also noticed as they were running they started to get into sink and there wasn't a bunch of independent Runners but there was some kind of group running naturally going on so they were settling in kind of hitting a similar level and how they were running there was this, blend I don't know what word to use but this harmony blend what in the running it was very nice so I think we're also talking about that type of thing uh a whole class at a similar level, uh, it's fun to play with anyway somebody it's uh right you know you bring that up and I actually remember that exercise in the ballroom on Oak Street when you did that and uh I remember this one I mean you really got completely in sync as a as a runner going around that Circle and I remember this one day it still stands out for me and you bring you just triggered in the memory was that at one point this woman that was in the circle that was running with us just took off she just like bolted and it was like she was in this other altered state of consciousness that just emerged from the synchronous activity of the crowd I mean it was remarkable and uh you know you had you had to almost calm her down to get her back into sync but it was an interesting thing that occurred I, it still stands out for me 30 years later right we would say probably uh in her set laying down first phase that up being present on her run uh and because of the group run she was affected by that, it kicked her into a finer level and that's when she was a bit different her body movement was different your speed was definitely different uh probably the way she flowed I had a nice flavor to it all that stuff yeah, yeah so she uh what, do runners call that when you go through the wall you're sort of when you're running it sort of a wall Runners, block Runners wall all those Runners High but that when they break through that yeah, there's a loft of it yeah uh so, you break through the limitations of your two by two or three by three whatever and suddenly ah in your street by you were getting very tired you didn't think you're going to be able to continue and, you break through that it potentially naturally happen you can facilitate its tricks but it potentially naturally happens and you break through and suddenly we call it dumb things like ah he's got a second win well he's moving from his three bot to a four by of course there's more breathing room there so yeah okay second win but more than you, your breathing improved your dimensionality potentially improves so a breathing and all the other stuff goes on with it you know the pains you were suffering running in a two buyer what whatever when you shift to uh the next Dimension a lot of those assembly, not as a parent or not uh debilitating you still may be aware but it's a whole different level of awareness they're not pulling you down you sort of are aware of them but things are moving fine yeah fine yeah well I'm thinking you know when the guys count Cadence while they March I think that brings them into a unit and they're able to draw on each other's strengths and then feel as a unit when they go into fighting and maybe in a similar sense singing in church where it's not for performing for an audience it's to bring the group together yeah and uh thoughts were entering my mind earlier and I wanted to bring in the military marching together and stuff uh but I didn't know how to word it well so I did it so thank you uh, yeah I've always enjoyed with a group a group chanting we were all in the same room uh and we do simple you know oh whatever uh simple stuff but uh but maybe you can hit a level where, it's a shared sound and it's really I don't know beautiful quite an experience pretty simple we just, settle and make her sound and settle and settle and make her sound and settle and make her sound and, before too long uh Boom the, the, the sound is really in harmony we're all experiencing it it's a beautiful happening yeah it's, Mike from New Zealand um yeah I still have very strong memories of the first time that you came out and Richard was with you and we were in the in the Dojo or wherever it was the place of training in the evening in a big circle when you started that and um, it really felt like the roof was going to come off the place it was that there was that much energy in the whole process it was a it was a yeah a very memorable experience yeah wow seriously yeah Bob here hey Mike I spent a day when I was in the Air Force with the Thunderbirds the Air Force aerial demonstration team and then but you have to sit in kind of at the beginning of their day that, just I didn't fly with them but when they would stand up from their weather briefing even before that when they closed their little notebooks from that moment on they were completely in sync walking out the door you just put a ladder climbing into the plane so that they didn't have to wait till they were going 600 miles an hour with an 18 inch separation from the planes to get in sync and they probably wouldn't be a very good idea yeah so they're already on which, we call that settling down and opening up to be at a better level uh before they even approached their planes uh about what they call the they were doing their weather or whatever yeah they had a weather briefing so they know what the winds were like and stuff before they before they get on the planes so you see they're, already settling down and opening up during the briefing so that when they get up they continue and then when they get into the plane as Bob says then they're ready to fly whatever how many inches apart at 600 miles an hour whoa yeah, yeah uh so I used to mention students a lot you know before you come to the dojo try to start your settling down opening up process whatever when you're driving to the dojo when you're walking to the dojo the dojo when you're walking to the dojo when you're in the dressing room putting on your D whatever don't, wait till you're on the mat and go okay what are we going to do uh because then we have to take that time there to do these earlier things which really you should have been doing before that okay no, later than the dressing room okay uh, or don't go into the meeting and Sunday okay now I'm at the meeting uh start to prep by settling and opening so the one that walks into the meeting room is he she who she who attends meetings properly fully they're fully listening hearing getting the flavor of stuff okay yeah I mean what would you say about in a sense we bow when we start the class but we bow and we step onto the mat we actually bow when we enter the dojo that's I think part of what you're talking about yeah I would just do it earlier but yeah maybe the Bowing it now I'm really, here kind of thing but, yeah but there should have been my, partner would just sharp distance of an American block away from the dojos it's just a moment to walk there but even there was a settling down time yeah Bali another level boom get into so that when you're there you're there you're there at a certain level yeah anyway okay, um let's see oh what's our count so far we're 28. a little quieter tonight uh Lauren's out uh he's in Salt Lake City um teaches out at some I forgot what he found, um, Diane Florida out but okay fair, number uh so uh foreign trading in yeah trading it uh well since they said the hang on a second uh second uh yeah trading in is cool very important if you don't trade in it's easier to get stuck okay step means they're stuck at Bobby's level or Robert's level it's easy to get stuck, but when you get the sense of trading in moving along uh dementia trading in heavier inner dimension for finer being um that's, very cool very, important, uh, and um so I, thought of oh Sensei as the great trade-in master so if we kick into this picture here uh so here he is in the green as an old man okay he just referred himself at that level This Old Man, and he was able he was very which catching on to how things were he was able to trade in this old man to the next and the next and so very quickly he could go from this old man to oh my God what's happening here who is this uh that, speed, of trading in he said over and over it's so easy not though but you have to catch it it's so easy okay uh so I know uh there's a lot of trials and tribulations at first from our one by one space or two by two space uh but that sense it, really potentially is very easy and very direct so don't go anywhere it's here very direct so osensei was the great trading Master okay, oops, those diagrams here which is thanks okay I guess we could use that so here, we are in this space to start with okay and trading in to get to the next space okay now trade-ins are not just an idea or concept uh when you trade in the next level uh very important that there's also an experience at that next level that's where we bring the body in okay even in finer and finer and finer you don't have a physical body but there is one of the earlier Dimensions an energy body uh, finer and finer we'll eventually mention bring up uh um nande not astral bodies uh archetype bodies I'll we'll go into archetype bodies one, day as being something that is referenced at a very fine level but also Keeps Us body, body, sense going so not physical body a certain part will bring in archetype bodies okay uh that's for another day so where are we here trading in I'm interested uh let's say maybe we should do one standing let me do one standing, let me do one standing something simple okay yeah okay oh let's start someplace let's say let's use fair day okay easy Fair Day ah sugar I'm feeding myself I'm checking myself I'm checking my attitude my viewpoint, four day Fair Day it's sort of like if you ask me how things are going I'd say they're okay, okay Paradise they're okay notice my breathing is fair breathing from my toes not bad but show me Fair very good I didn't see a certain amount I hear Cotton Candy Kitchen ah okay so I've noticed what my sensors picked up a bit where I saw what I heard and you say what I'm feeling fair day okay all right we got the fair day person everybody got your fair day person you can use whatever name you want your two by two person whatever okay as long as we're all doing a similar thing here so everything the center in the circle the person in their world let's say Fair Day all of that in down trading it to a finer Dimension easy finer dimension okay now I think or since I'm at a finer Dimension because I can sense more, space than here to four I just sense more space I sent it was a bit D verb this under round deeper more space deep very easy very easy all the previous Fair Day everything at the fair day guy and his fair day world trading in this dimensional hermit to call it world not a typical word this dimensional level is something better so I call it a good day easy don't think at first feel or I'd say the body is very important so let's call that feeling three unit you're at a better level bigger more energy nutrients qualities available, and not that's just an idea as a mix of blend a harmonization and soon here comes a good day guy ah okay sure okay good thing guys feeling himself my breathing is definitely changing wants to change more okay I notice I'm standing stronger on a good day, Trader and a little stronger than a backup support the mix I call it of the energies of the circle and Center mixing up into this guy goodbye [Music] so what we did there was a trade in ah, I don't like you sit in dialogue a moment to tell me your sense of a trade-in your trips of the trade uh anything I can help you with anything you can help me with okay that was a simple example of a trade-in okay uh it's important, to have a sense of it in this map okay Brad can you adjust this for me the Manifest world we're in the Manifest world okay uh manifest world okay but to learn some simple levels of trade in here are very good because we're going to continue trading in eventually will make a big trade-in from the Manifest world to you know sensate the words the Hidden World I also call The Domain that's a big shift but since it was cool enough sharp enough whatever to move into that heavenly, is that recorded heavenly Divine okay uh he called them anything I sometimes call the Heaven There vice versa, to move it to that level and to be fully, present right through all of those that's why I emphasize this feeling this present not just an idea uh it's going to be a problem if you just idea your way into find and find her that her that eventually you'll get spun out there you really for like the words need the grounding I know that's a physical word but something akin to grounding something akin to a body that's present it's not a physical body anymore but something akin to it so you retain a, good set all the way through a good set okay you don't shift okay now I don't need to feel or sense anymore I can just think about heavenlies or something it's not going to work out well people home, trust me on that it's not going to work out well so if we can start off better properly thank you if we can start off better properly uh, Donald sustain us that click, click, click uh that's cool see I'll sit there was fast at this uh okay, zoom boom but not boom, it was it was all here don't go anywhere it's here or let me think about it being here no, it's here best I can do in words I'm sorry no words are quite gonna do it but the tricks for like a word like on tricks of the trades the tricks, of the trades the tricks that you got even doing a simple Fair Day to a good day that's what I'm asking you about tell me about that what's your sense of anything there what's cool for you there change your words it's okay what words would you use there talk to me oh go ahead uh I was just gonna say that for me one of the first things that came up was the ground it was like a base of uh support and then that then revealed the structure that was present and what was available there so it kind of highlighted the body it highlighted The body it highlighted The Presence by that just the very nature of the ground being present or the base there yeah um yeah we're getting a little bit better at this, uh so this trade in all the energies of the circle which sometimes call it the world the situation you're in but all the energies of that down so that's being traded in the centered previous body character he's being traded in now we're sort of starting fresh and the freshness is all the energy let's use potted plants all the nutrients of, the soil are here and whatever the plant has and both of them become one thing a superior plant and I'll try to say that better maybe not tonight but of uh eventually so Roy's picking it up like oh this ground support and I'm just adding saying yes and it's even more than that it's all the nutrients being part of the mix of the next okay, worked there I was a people through the best we can some somebody Bob I thought I heard your voice trying to jump in uh yes I'd say uh my experience as you were mentioning space I could feel more space in the body and so there was a beginning of that transition from one type of body to another type of body but when you feel that space in the body it helps to keep you here and feeling experiencing and not awarenessing I find it critical even historically I used to tell you uh on doing any practice we used to do with this uh, don't think about it at first feel it feel it feel it in the Fuller feeling don't actually be a, not a thinking but an awareness an attitude a different viewpoint but not to jump for that one first could you tend to do an awareness idea first and, tend to miss I don't know what word to use it's partner or the Fuller of this structure the Fuller of the structure feeling, aware of where I experience experiencing I am aware okay that's very important all along the way all along the way okay the words may change but as we get finer but the process pattern not really changes it's just finer and finer more original more original, okay so these simple tricks, of the trade that we practice at simple levels Bobby to Robert, can not, do uh don't sell those short because they're good first step Preps you won't need them forever some days you wake up and it's hey ah and you're at a pretty good level okay that's your starting level then now let's move uh but if you find yourself getting pushed in which could happen uh you kind of know what to do you recognize it yeah how do I know I'm being pushed in because I can't damn straighten up how do you know you're being pushed in because I'm getting things are looking negative out there uh very obviously you begin to recognize the onslaught of a of a push in or tightening in I choose not to go too tight anymore I've been there been get so crazy or a lot crazy scary, crazy uh so anytime I start to feel a compression of any, form that I'm using a physical compression mental compression whoa better stop and start my process because I don't want to be pushed any further tighter crazy Bobby's bad enough weird Bobby Bobby's bad enough weird Bobby I tell you he's dangerous he's dangerous to himself and dangerous to you, want to go too tight that's me that's my style your type of crazy and this is probably a bit different there's a lot of different type of crazies out there you've got your own style of going crazy everybody push tight enough he'll get a bit weird okay uh so you're not alone in how it works anyway where the hell are we but uh tricks of the trade uh, your sense of trading in uh Sensei it's dusty I'll say something what I expressed in that trade-in was like I was glad you were talking about finer because I was doing what you called me out on last week where I was sort of grasp like kind of out there and then I kind of went inside and as soon as I did that there's almost like a dissolving but also a grounding okay, okay what do you say okay going inside because I'm inside your body careful of that okay I don't mean that inside into different dimensional space that shows flavors a bit bigger a bit deeper after a while a bit Freer a bit airier so to speak okay so inside doesn't mean like inside the body yeah don't, screw this up okay now continue something more air I know that I like that distinction because I was that's been good like well it I don't know it just it's a sets Praises it in a different way I guess when it's not inside I don't have to Define it I don't know it just helpful can we say it's like a doorway into a finer space it's just a doorway you're not meant to get stuck in the doorway, you've passed through and you're in a bigger room a nicer room and as we continue even nicer in some way okay way okay yeah it feels like two there's like uh as I think about this it's like a trading in with the ease of the eye or when you're saying maybe I had to find a great place to practice being easy I might I'm teaching my daughter how to drive so being like with a teenager and driving and trying to be easy and not yell at her and calm it's a really good practice but there's different levels of that as I I'm talking now I think maybe I don't know, well the all the other words an approaches easy the eye yes uh yes uh settle down there's more room yes what are some of the others we use fairly often letting go yes clearing yes and I'm just trying out that one phrase it's just a trading okay, uh see sometimes maybe people get a little confused you say well it's important to let go of things you gotta if you're a Bobby you gotta let go of Bobby and his scent of the world now Bobby let's go and all we're trying to do is get him to settle and open and move into Robert's territory so I'm just calling that a trade it one thing people might screw that up with is okay what should I let go of now okay well I've got an angry neighbor I'm angry at my Angry neighbor I have to let go of that okay or oh wait what about the dog that barks every morning when I'm still trying to sleep oh, no I've got to let go of that what about my boss at work what about the crazy kid in my class uh you can go crazy looking for stuff to let go of it's a spiritual masturbation okay so I'm just trying to say let's do it in felt soup it's a trading boom bang okay so yes clearing is inherent in there letting go is inherent in there, letting go is inherent in there more room is inherent in there it's trading that's what I'm sort of hoping for and again I'm asking you all your sense of attraction talk to me it says chip, chip I don't know about everybody else but I need to breathe me either yeah I would bring my emotional body to the ground like what Roy was talking about the ground is there bring the emotional body the feeling body to that in a is of surrender yeah and what happens after that who knows who knows open, to that possibility yeah okay hold it there a sec uh yeah that's cool uh emotional body but don't take that body into it you're carrying something heavy maybe, okay or I'm talking to other people don't carry that distinctly if you carry Bobby into Robert's territory it's hard to be a robber because you're got Bobby you carried Bobby into this I've told you this many times using a great phrasing of mine you've heard it before you can't get pregnant if you're pregnant, this is what I meant you can't carry this heaviness into something finer and really be the totality of that level of finer when you're carrying something to and your sense of it is that it's still here because you carried it with you so that that's what I'm not sure if I heard you're right but talking to everybody in exchange of what is known and held on to, something that is unknown and yes that's really going to be a little bit gutsy people because a lot of people won't even make that first step they won't let go of what they know for what they don't know and, there is we'll get into the dark aspect of it not tonight but I want to maybe next week uh, okay where am I going uh see this is where it gets hard for people who are who better than the average let's, say okay you ask them to trade in and they're letting go of what they've got they're letting go of their identity there I'm superior and I'm asking and trade it in trade it in boom and see who you are at this next level, okay, a lot of people panic along the way because they sort of lose their first identity maybe in this time but there's a center I'm losing myself it's scarier than hell I'll let you understand the trick of it that's just Bobby but fine I'm treating Bobby and of course Bobby's gonna for a moment of course of course but suddenly here's Robert and Robert takes over hey okay and I don't know if I was ever that happy with Bobby anyway but some people are happy with their Superior selves I'm better than everybody else than a neighbor you want me to trade that in but if I do that maybe I won't be better than everybody else maybe I'll come up worse just a misunderstanding it doesn't work that way thank you it's finer, definer to more original more original infer and finer and finer that's, how it works the dimensionality game uh but that's why you have to sort of practice a bit to be very clear oh it just doesn't get worse just another level of finer and lo and behold it's still me but I mean I never recognized before okay once I caught that, was fairly, early in my meditation time uh but I see what I catch uh hang on I lost the thought oh but once I got sort of got clear to me through the experience of doing stuff like this uh I realized if I had an identity uh they're okay right now I'm a Robert or something but I knew it was temporary after having done this for a bit it's like well I need a name for the day so hello my name is Robert but I knew that was a transition that I really didn't know who I was I was very interested well who am I really boom, boom and some of the things are sometimes start links like whoa really, okay but then things begin to happen to give me feedback you know whatever I did invited to give a talk someplace me but they were reacting to this guy they were inviting this guy am I saying any of this properly so we try to go over in these sessions the misunderstandings like this one we're talking about is a very critical one uh sometimes you're going to be if you continue this work you're going to be at a pretty fancy level you're going to the sense of self and this finer Dimensions you're in gets pretty fancy and you go whoa me whoa I'm, spiritual I'm special I, sense this and that you know what could now trade it in and a lot of people can't do it okay they get too much going for them they're noted as being Superior you think they're going to let that go some will, many unfortunately don't okay, yeah so you have to have some kind of calling to continue because if you don't have some calling you're going to stop short and be satisfied oh I feel better my life is better leave me alone Sensei don't bother me anymore I'm happy you tell me that clearly and I will leave you alone oh I may try to whatever but stop me leave me alone sensei because you're happy it's sufficient okay but don't come to my advanced, class because we're going to move on and on okay something like that like you say sense8 there's that and then and, and now in the Manifest it gets finer and finer and finer and finer and finer uh ever so long I'm not asking you to go into a three by three four by four five by five six by six seven by seven and tell you by the way there's eight thousand of those your goal will screw this I'm exhausted here okay, what happens is once you get a bit of flavor how things work uh let's using my County a one by can't pull it off very well two by me and not really three by there's a hint I can't a oh boom 4 by should be so four but I should be so where you get where itself begins to show it's there you got a sense of how it works thicker to finer of uh that these dimensional walls aren't really so thick you sense through them very quickly they're, almost nothing they're paper I call them Paper Walls and even that's too heavy but they're not brick cement uh once you get a sense experiential not just oh yeah okay I believe that won't quite do it because we want a full passage a full through this and fullness includes what we call body or, experience the experience, the experience now you'll trick me oh I'm thinking about experience I understand experience and you're damn well not experiencing that's why I'd like to really feel the body keep me honest and when I start off doing that then I can continue with that sense of the fullness the fullness to fullness, the fullness to fullness okay uh I, got lost there uh a chip bring me back on course where are we here but you know the piece that came up for me is um and it reflects through the body and that's how I would prefer to see it and not try to own it own it through those Dimensions but just let it express through the bad kind of be a witness to and then later a sense experience sense experience not just sense a sense experience of that presence that a chip is talking about yeah, sometimes in, the map on the mat I sometimes stand that way at a certain level, and you've come at me before so you kind of know sometimes I'm standing there and if flavor's different uh that you're even wondering why you're coming in maybe you already feel caught up or something you know something like that yeah that's that what you're talking about that level of inner sensing experiencing and it I don't know radiates out to where he even chip over there can go oh I hate coming in on him now or something yeah, just it's there yeah oh yeah oh yeah thank you thank you somebody where, are we at what's it for you the tricks of the trade of a trade-in I think so it's um Mark here um wait Mark yeah, um we're going through that, trade in there that there seems to be a um for me a moment of almost um nothingness get this um yeah I can't it's, not it's not like a long moment but just, for a moment there nothingness nothing yeah, I was just wondering if you could talk about that a little bit okay yeah all right even, on our simple ones moving from a one by two to a two by or two by two or three by I think we're, doing a fair to good yeah uh on that first trade in it's not clear yet easy isn't that clear yet so could look very empty or a sense of nothing okay now some spiritual types are looking for this sort of quiet empty and they think that's the goal sorry uh sorry uh yes that's a nice clear open space what's going on in this space and who am I in this space they sometimes stop short with oh it's so quiet it's so nothing I've arrived yeah, okay it's okay it's, the something before the actor active something that's not read the words but it's a it's there and then there's the actual activity presence of creation at that level going on through the damn words but anyway yeah uh, my early sense of the uh empty was uh something like uh when I, called it darker dark to me you know say when I saw dark it didn't mean there wasn't anything there I had to sense that there's something there but I can't see it yet but dark didn't say nothing it was me oh it looks kind of dark and I didn't have the ability then to know the trick of past utilizing that and going deeper to a finer Dimension I didn't know that trick at the time but I knew that it's not dark, dark empty nothing it's I can't see or experience I'd say now I can't see experience what's going on so that dark was it I don't have to call it transition into the next level and if I couldn't experientially pass through to the next level I would just see the dark and again look empty it looked like nothing for some people well we'll get into dark I think next week it's a part of this uh get scared by it okay if it's dark it's got to be the Devils because God is white light and it's really screwed things up it's sad, uh but we'll cover dark because it's very important uh and we'll come up in very Advanced levels territory it's very important uh anyway we'll hold that off till next week uh Bob if I might um just in response to Mark's question of that hit there was a great way you used to talk about it that you've got to put down the court to pick up the half gallon but for a lot of people they put down the court and then there's nothing in their hand and they grab the cord again oh yeah no that that's one thing that will happen uh a person is uh would say Robert or whatever okay and he hears he can maybe be a better person or something and he tries to process holy it's dark or it's empty or whatever oh he comes back to Robert sure as better be a Robert who's alive and whatever and whatever then it'd be in this no man's land or no person land yeah no uh folks can scare easy that's again why I, sort of like doing these sessions to explain some of these things that are just misunderstandings you know and the dark is a big one so it would be worth our time to go over it more clearly uh next week I'm waiting for Teja on this one because I also want uh the Oriental view of the dark times and we'll pick up the Western uh, style from Bob Noah uh I don't want to have both those guys that come, in on, that but next week next week ah, so we're saying on the trade again yes you could have a sense of empty yes there could be something of dark we'll clarify that and how to utilize that next week so yes is that good enough for mark, is that good enough yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, somebody trade in what's your sense how you doing well when you're talking about a fair day I mean I actually did have a fair day but I was really glad to Let It Go I mean it wasn't that great I mean it wasn't that fair so the idea of letting it go and like trading up it was uh really kind of an exciting idea so I just it felt like I was dropping some clothing you know like it was just dropping one costume and you know just going into a whole nother unknown place and I got very full and heavy and my spine kind of opened up and softened which was uh it was just very full very rather physical but, very nice and again what we said earlier somebody else careful of holding the body it's, okay to be aware of those things going on in the background could, we say oh the spine is changing but don't hang on to it because you may try to carry that heavier into something and you, you can move along better than that you don't have to take this body and have it a little bit better uh that that's kindergarten for you knock it off if I heard what you're saying yeah which is interesting it went physical I didn't know where it was going to go it went physical but that's a good admonition to like let it keep opening past that too yeah, yeah but I, do note those things, you know uh but I, don't hang on to them and carry them heavy into this I don't want to carry I don't have to say it carry heavy stuff into a finer because the fiber grouping can't show uh but I'm aware it's along the way what might be going on in this system not that I major in it whatever but I just I can't just catch it and again people the words our will try to you know trying to have yet uh speak my language but you're free to change the words okay uh because uh because oh if you're there at that level I'll understand probably how are you using that word there so I use for example uh he's Catherine on tonight anyway a few weeks ago or something she said something about settling and dialoguing with other entities very clear to me she was talking to what I call selves our soul selves or whatever oh she calls them entities okay got no problem nope no problem okay if somebody says gee it feels like an empty space okay I have a sense of what where you're at with that somebody says it looks vacant oh I have a sense of where you're at somebody said uh there's nothing going on oh I have a sense of where you're at come on people the whatever words you like but don't get locked in on them gee this looks vacant to me but since I said empty come on come on come on don't hang on to those words try my words if they're not conducive what are your words in fact I'm asking you that tonight I call it a trade-in is there any sense of it that you have I want to hear about it okay did I say that okay was I almost polite in saying that very polite oh good oh good such a rare ticket it was quite a good Sensei I'm a bit disappointed because I'll be hanging out to, do the um the glass of milk and The Jug um, as, one of the best examples that I that you and you did it years ago um that I have for that trading process because it is so simple and so clear and the idea of having to actually let go of you know stop grasping what you've got and then be in a space which is just it well apparently empty but being able to move to The Jug and get hold of that new handle um yeah give it time the words that come up there some of these come from most sense say easy they're easy, easy I might add things like let it unfold it will unfold if you're easy it'll clarify itself easy okay so for example when I move into if you're doing a two by three by four by game uh I move into next and I don't know what word I'd use it's empty nothing's going on easy let it unfold and then suddenly I, get a sense of some movement in a circular form not clear but I can feel something moving okay easy let it unfold and then there's a sense of a circular structure much clearer easy let it unfold and then the center starts to kick in circle boom, Center it just unfolds and there it is now ah let it easy let it unfold we could add Don't Panic don't freak out but don't run away Master easy let it unfold yeah I think the word patience that comes to my mind to that time in between that we need to learn to be able to trust yeah and there's a patience aspect to that especially in the area of experience be, patient because at first it's a bit slower much easier to think about something your thought pattern can be instant right Dr Frost The Experience especially at first could be a little slower yeah but it'll, it'll build up it will whoa yes you'll experience the experience, uh so you don't mind if earlier it was a little slower and it was easier to think than the field because you're fast with your thoughts and you're like a little kid in school whose hand goes up first because you want to be first okay not now not now not in this practice feel be patient easy let it unfold ah it will if you're present and allowing it yeah I can do in words thank you Mike yeah the other thing I just wanted to say just following on from the exercise you did was that and this was a noticing uh you, were using the expression I know you know I know things sometimes that standing there in that manifest space that first space and just experiencing it and then just noticing that my, belly just released um it wasn't a melt it was a it was almost an instant um tension that I didn't realize I was carrying you know just let go and, just kind of float down my legs into the floor, um again not something to stay hooked on just but oh it's interesting and, just keep the process going but I used to need uh early days as a relaxation practice and whatever else I was doing I would lay down on the ground and practice releasing, you know it's okay what's my tight part of my body I felt like my shoulders were up okay release that okay next what other part of the body is up a bit oh my knees okay relax let go there they'd relax okay but until, I could uh feel that my whole body was flat and even better was beginning to melt into the floor sensation yeah but I used to play with releasing in that it's a nice relaxation practice a nice physical practice you don't have to do that you know as an A, before of doing the, faster potential work here uh but okay we're we got a physical body might be nice to learn a couple of relaxed and relaxation practices if that one helps you fine no big deal yeah but don't no I didn't I didn't do anything I would I was not focusing on that at all I was just experiencing and it happened no and it but it was just quite a significant physical experience that I noticed yeah and I was just saying I wanted to come back and start a study physical systems and how they relaxed they were just a dumb example yeah thank you feminine voice somebody who that hello somebody started to talk now I miss herb okay all right we got a few more minutes here if you'd like uh creating it tricks of the trade from your end you're sent from your and creating it anything, foreign remember you picked up something very interesting in one of the earliest martial art books that came out in English, [Music], martial art books that came out in English it was by maso Yama oh yeah Old-Timers might recognize the name but he was one of the most prominent martial artists probably in the world in his time, and he wrote a book as his style of training was very, hard very, hard and at the end of the book he said he did an experiment where he took a new student and trained him in his extremely hard approach to training and another one went from his perspective was a softer approach with some meditation and more emphasis on forms and things like that speed and at the end of the sixth month speed right okay he compared the two and in almost every respect the student that he did what for him was the softer style of training was far superior yeah and then what you said was you look back at the 200 pages of the book before that then it was all the hard style training which in his own book he said it didn't work as well to me as a as a very prominent martial artist to this day uh what, you said about that which Rings true even more now with this practice is he couldn't trade it in even though he proved to himself that it was better who could not create it in it's hard it's hard sorry for some people it's hard that's why we try to find easier explanations try to clarify things so trading and it's not hard so that was a good example Bob was using here's the guy that liked his hard style did hard style for years but realized with this test with the heavy students and the lighter faster students, and the lighter faster students uh that oh my God the lighter faster ones uh are better they even hit harder than the heavy guys were hitting okay stuff like that but as Bob said couldn't let go of that teaching style because that was his major yeah hard to let go for some people impossible for some people let's not be one of those people okay yeah, again I think a lot of this is based on this inner self calling and we can't say oneself and then suddenly uh oh you got the most original Self, um so far my experience uh I'm doing a lot of work with Susan in dialogue with, other selves uh is uh there's also a range there some are like newbies uh and some aren't the, most advanced could I say so you have to instruct them a little bit on things uh help them to develop themselves as self okay uh where are we going uh my saying is right uh, oh the calling itself uh so to try to burn in our settling with a sense of self because as, we highlight I don't know if you say call self Surface I know you're here show yourself whatever be here bear with me uh that the, more knowledgeable whatever self is I mean it's your self it knows who you are it knows your what you're trying to accomplish it will aligning properly assist you okay um okay and some people have a stronger calling from the self okay using me as an example I can't not do this work because I know if I did I'd probably eventually become a drunk and what uh they go a little crazy drunk but I start to get a little more hit or a little type of craziness okay, uh, my calling for doing this work is very strong that a self-presence calling, oh sensing in a certain way couldn't not do what he was doing in fact with such a strong colleague he said he was always Under Pressure a lot of people don't know that but he was under pressure a lot because you're more than that who is she but Move Along come on you're more than that come on you're more than that this is a very strong self call okay so uh if, we can I don't know activate the self act uh help square away so the self that's here can begin to show more and more then it will help you to move through things and you'll get a fuller experience better self better the character, better your presence centered and circled, and centered whatever form you want to use for reference so self is a very important piece okay uh, [Music] and again it's certain level where it should begin to show I think we've tried on the Friday night save a one by one guy said self he means what do you mean me papi the word doesn't really mean anything to her, heavy guy like that settle do our basics with a sense that such a thing exists someplace here there is a self okay I settle open Easy moving to finer Dimension and here in the finer Dimension yes energies and makes and the character uh being bread born or whatever yes but also in this finer space there is a self a self that's here ah so an important piece okay uh let's see let's see um anyway if you've been hanging out with me for a couple years plus the 20 30 40 years before that there must be some kind of calling we could sort of trust or you would have given up on me long ago, okay you need you didn't want to go more with the form I was going more uh fine uh fine if you continued in some other format as long as you're continuing okay but I would surmise there's some kind of calling that you're still hanging out okay, I'm finishing up here but somebody something before we finish, so I'd say one thing that stands out for me is uh in what you've said is that it almost sounds like uh you could describe it as like a forming like this being is forming and that there's this Natural Energy or uh movement that actually forms this self that it's a like a real a creative process okay ah if I heard you okay set the most original Self is most original we're not limited selves and we have to and it's maybe I miss said it before and we're gonna have to help some people to realize they are more but see they are more they just Squirtles stunted along the way or something, right so it's ah how to say this um, in a certain way self doesn't have to develop itself self has to become aware of itself and aware of the more of itself and aware of the more original of itself uh that again the sofas like this the full page of paper it's there but you're here the paper ain't got no problem but you're not the paper you got a touch and you'll always have a touch okay a saving Factor so it's just a realization that there is in, a finer self should show here I mean you get a scent of the manifests pretty good self there okay [Music] it's just so fear oh Sensei went full bore, whole damn thing did I say that right is that okay so if I say you know develop the self I, sort of I'm not saying it s potential isn't full but there are some, developments because we got caught up in this Vortex of tigers Tighter and Tighter and so the self is very tight in there okay and because it's heavy it's sort of shrouded over by the heaviness that's why one by one guy a weird Bob eight you asked him about self he doesn't know what you're talking about he doesn't give a give a so to speak easy, easy so it's there just have to easy clear let go whatever so that that's there can begin to show okay, something like, that so okay, the words the words the words the words the words the best we can are you sort of okay right yeah we'll talk on the phone I've gotta I want to pursue this a little further I've got some other uh thoughts there goes my Sunday shut the hell but it's getting late thank you Sensei it's almost eight o'clock I don't know if anybody's got any last thing otherwise uh yeah I guess before Roy Cuts us off yeah okay thanks for hanging out I hope you got something uh yeah I'm thinking the uh dark uh, because it's really big time it's really important uh there are certain stages in this movement where it's big time and important uh yeah we'll talk about that thank you thank you thanks for hanging out people thank you thank you Bob it's Dave oh have a good night thank you sir thank you thank you Roy

## Aikido, Inner Sensing as an Experience, Nadeau Shihan, Virtual Dojo, 2021-09-09

yeah good evening sensei hey how are you okay welcome okay what'd we do last week we were off last week oh that's why that's why I couldn't yeah before I forget and remind me at the end we're off next week technical difficulty uh so next week nothing take another weekend off and process okay [Music], is this clear this think I think settling on our opening feeling and they're again more than one level or dimension of feeling, easy and settle and you're more sensitive feeling easy and subtle and another level of feeling, that could be more inclusive okay soon eventually you shift into sensing fencing and there'll be levels of sensing okay uh but I don't see where we're at let me let me skip my notes for a moment ah okay I think tonight we wanted to remind you uh sensing as an experience maybe there's a tendency with us humans to learn the word I think yes I got the word, and like yeah but as long as you know that in sensing uh it's not just aware of sensing uh or you're thinking more about it that's not that's not what we're doing here now sensing and sensing has as part of itself within itself, within itself experiential so which we call that experiential sensing okay it's giving my notes real quick uh inner sensing as an experience hmm, okay again we, tend to throw out words so uh you know uh the word sense is oft used and oh yeah my sense about that is dot, but there's not been any real sensing okay you're allowed to do that as long as you know you're doing it and if you really want to be finer level sensing you have to know that that's a and at first especially I have to go through a little process Next Level easy settle open finer Dimensions Next Level that unto that to really appropriately sense, I hope I'm saying this okay uh, in my conversations with osenza he uses the word sensing a lot uh, uh when he was talking about the uh, bullets flying around in the russo-japanese war although they weren't being aimed at him he was in the area where they were flying around and he could sense that okay he could sense bullet flying around uh then uh as he had more advanced sensing in Manchuria when they're actually paving at him trying to hit him uh he could sense that and that's when he'd move and the bullets would go by because he was pre-warned for lack of words he could sense them coming he had plenty of time to move and they'd go by so a finer level of sensing and let's see if I want to tell this story again his, finding this level of sensing following his stories was his fight with the naval Captain this famous he went to the well and golden Vapors and all that uh he said the guy was damn good damn good okay had really developed himself he was fast he was strong uh I know Sensei was fast and strong but since I said I had a little Edge over him but it was real close real close what happened there was since they moved into a whole different Realm we'll continue with the word sensing but a whole different realm of sensing okay so he puts his sword or both hand down, which pisses the guy off no end because it feels like a Sensei is dissing him okay and as the guy is swinging he's really pissed he really wants to get him essentially he says he's just walking around and around and, it's kind of like with the bullets there there'd be a sense of Here Comes something time to move and he was just walking around he wasn't in harmony doing his Basics he wasn't at that level he had shifted levels like wow and not just a finer level this is a big jump rule Trading, mention another time but right now we're in the level of better development better development better development uh and then eventually we'll see about the potential for doing what osensei did potential okay but let's upgrade ourselves in the world okay all right let's learn the basics uh, get a sense of the basics which are very important to get a sense of something before all these Basics but I'm getting into something else there so oh, [Music], sensing easy but let's just settle for a little bit okay easy, nothing to think about but that may be going on right easy the eye easy infers for some people more space for some people more space and a little deeper Sense little [Music] 50 percents in that easy, as you settle with a sense of opening and a sense easy settle open ER Dimension level yeah okay so going from thinking to feeling again and feeling there are many levels okay we try to show that uh pretty simply uh in that old basic that we show or mention where uh in Aikido for example somebody grabs and the other person after a minute goes oh okay they've been held on strongly for a long time and they go oh okay as they settle and open better level of feeling, they feel the fingers starting to wrap around and there they're starting to move with them potentially okay settle a finer level of feeling you begin to feel boom you, felt it coming in okay and then the ones Bob and I Noah talked about uh back in the day we'd have them practice blindfolded and uh somebody very quietly not making any noise uh very quietly coming in okay, and to the point where then Bob was pretty good at this restaurant mentioning his name here uh feeling it coming in way before and it started to move way before they're on it okay so different levels of feeling okay are we okay so far continuing to settle open sense of better finer Dimension easy minor dimension, sensing, sensing okay so sensing is not what you're thinking about we've been through we went through that one sensing is not what you're feeling we've been through that one sensing, sensing at first you don't have anything to relate to so I'm not sure if we could ask what are you sensing okay but just, to settle you down get you in a better location uh okay uh okay what if here we bring in a couple of example cases uh of people who work every day with people and are using uh, sort of this approach okay Elaine are you on yeah Cynthia I'm on here let me just get myself set up here can you hear me yeah, I'm here there you are I can even see you I oh hi okay A, moment or so for your, basic settling down and going through what we just went through before you present yourself with a patient client, okay your basic settling opening any yeah I mean at this point I don't spend a lot of time in thinking I'll tell you that it really we're just you know um the, easy the eye and all that other prep happens you know before people come in yes you're not really hanging out and thinking about things at that point at all yeah did you just start from a better place which is you know you talk about that yeah and in feeling um, there's you know it's um, [Music], I, can I, can in feeling I, I can feel who they are okay, patient client in front of you yeah and um you know if I'm you know past wondering about them and thinking and you know what are their questions going to be and all that I can just be with them I can I can feel who they are and it's, really actually important to spend time with this okay in a way they, can begin to feel like they have space in the room in a way so a way so um being present feeling you're like out there a bit Yeah present in feeling with them and, it's not like a sit down and meditate with them it's just a way of just being present with them yeah you know we can still talk to each other but it's just a way of, allowing for it and let them take their space um in me having space I naturally give them space Also yeah, and, yeah you what starts to happen is the progression into this improved being together yeah is natural yeah I don't feel like I have to work this scenario a lot it's natural if, I'm in a good place with them in a feeling sense and we're both comfortable there then moving from that into sensing um feels like, I have more spread in the room my feeling of being with them is lighter and, and I think I said to you this afternoon there's a way they, feel like they have more 3D but I think it's just really that this availability of information in the room okay that's just way improved yeah okay uh what we're talking about here is uh when you get into sensing [Applause], and all that opening for both of us patient and, and healer uh there's it starts to show that there's, it starts to show that there's more information available so they're going to have degrees of sensing okay and Susan and I are bumping into that in our work that oh my God it's opening up bigger and bigger with more information you know you go from that person and their problems to that person, and their problems to that person and their family in case there's any family things happening that are affecting that person and on and now it grow it keeps growing the historical of that person will somebody will mention that later I'm sorry go ahead well and the information actually it's interesting because I feel like I really can't in a certain way um I was gonna say I can't decide how this is going to go because that's back in the thinking realm also but I it's there's this continual letting go this continual clearing and, more and clearing and more and, I can't really in a way hang on to what I think I know about them yeah, let me jump in as soon as you hang on if potentially you're stuck at that level even though it could be a damn good level you're also stuck at that level yeah so how not to get stuck and how to be open for a continual moving along yeah, I mean whatever you picked up whatever experience information whatever you picked up yes so noted now keep moving keep moving yeah that information isn't lost yeah but you got to keep moving could we say it that way yeah that the process also in there's this feeling of it just continuing in a natural way and that um, oh how was I gonna say this, oh we were talking about sustaining a few months ago and, it seems to me that in all of this, continuity in the sustaining of this state is, it happens because you keep letting go that you don't hang on to anything that I, don't grab on to you know oh I, should do something with their hip right now I don't grab on to anything I just move with them in that state and, just I, try to pay attention to how I'm listening to them and to myself yeah and listening I don't think she means it's not hearing no it's you know it's how you have to care for the words I, listen to them I know it weren't as in a sensing level uh we're not well you got to tell me something so I know what to do kind of thing and so the words that's why we try to have to create our own language a bit yeah, should we call that sense hearing uh whatever anyway, I just it feels as, you keep kind of you know letting go and moving through those Dimensions the resources keep improving yes, yes that's probably the main point there I don't know how big this can get I mean really what what's available to us oh my God yeah and what's available to them you know if you if we if I can um, get out of my way and get out of their way where are they gonna go yeah be at a better level to read sense what's being said or presented at their level and to continue that opens up or you're getting better but they're also opening up and their system for like a word is presenting more information and uh I don't know just so far oh my God this is big this is big we're just like almost scratching the surface so to speak yeah ah yes Elaine anything to finish for now yeah and the thing she said was after a bit you don't start heavy uh you naturally start at a better level that, just comes along with you practicing that you're, rarely Bobby and even Robert checks himself before he walks into a meeting and says oh I'm a Robert not good enough I have to be Mr Nado at the meeting kind of thing so you start better okay right yeah and uh if you find yourself starting tight and crazy uh pass I'll get to you in a few minutes sorry to keep you waiting but you gotta pass okay weird here uh so I, think Sensei this is Sean I hear like a resounding I'm sorry resounding do you get that one sounding yeah so it's like it's like I don't know it's like you know when I don't know it feels like you know it's like you hear it you hear it and it's like an echo and you keep hearing it and you keep hearing it and it's like you're there preparation reverberation thank you thank you thank you a better, word if you're there if you're there at that level of, sensing that you're hearing something that's one form of communication there uh and you stay at that level uh and it's important it'll sort of repeat itself I feel like with, Bodywork that's very much what I feel Bodywork is feels very much like a resounding yeah, whatever let's say I don't know how important that is it rebounds it's like yeah maybe so but I don't know I'm sorry but I, don't know how important that is it's just you're there and you're hearing it and you hear it a little bit clearer maybe a little more distinctly so you know that's probably the fact of this location because you've heard it more than once kind of thing so in that sense yeah I just don't want to get people being caught up in a bounding uh echoing voice thing here it's no important day sorry no, I hear you it is that, re-sounding like, you know like in the riverboats they would they would say Mark you know and it was like you know there was someone who would be throwing a weight over the side and they figure out how deep they were you know and it's like because things we all read Mark Twain yes, of course of course thank you thank you oh okay all right Susan you on yes sensei okay but talk for a moment so we can hear it make sure our connection is clear say what uh can you hear me okay I think so okay, um anything again fairly quickly on your settling down process depth is critical and since we've been working on space I do a lot more up front of acknowledging um space okay so before a session at the beginning of a session I really acknowledge the space and that seems to just immediately open up, a whole bunch okay all right uh so again people they're, different words or forms you could use so she likes space somebody else may say well I'm, Easy in this situation and then I get easier but if you notice as you're hanging out with that word experiencing that word uh it's getting bigger and more spacious more, room is there so, far so good yeah space and again depth is really uh critical for me and there are times that I'll appreciate that I'm not deep enough for this so I settle deeper, yeah this is where all sensei's word Roots come in roots are down here okay make sure you have good roots okay it doesn't just mean your feet but in your sensing uh sense deeper in this openness yeah and there are times that I appreciate I haven't, done enough and I will actually step out of the room walk down the hall take some breaths do a little bit on my own and then go back in okay does that mean you walked into the room too soon with your patient client possibly yes ah anyway again those tricks of uh knowing a patient's coming in you're doing a lot of preliminary before they come in kind of thing and, uh everyone you'll get that sense of doing that, that's important to do uh you don't want to go into the meeting being a tight idiot and then try to adjust to the meeting you can do it that way but you're wasting time and you didn't really hear the first five minutes of the dialogue in the meeting kind of thing so the more you can prep open whatever, prep so then when you go into the meeting deal with your client whatever ah you're more there okay right there I remember doing little things pre Aikido class you know so when I was actually on the mat I was really there okay, kind of thing so you just learned to, do these earlier whatever you want to call them clearings that there's earlier preparation I don't know if I like that word but yeah uh so that when you're there you're there whether it's a meeting or Aikido mat Dojo or what the hell yeah okay we're moving along here Susan ah yes anything about feeling before you get to sensing, you got your client in front of you now well initially there's a I have to use the word sense there's a sense that there's a whole Bunch that's available, and then sort of like Elaine said getting out of the way so that what's relevant, and what the patient the client wants to show can come through how could we say that better uh in your first settling opening with them there could be a lot going on there and you gotta easy yes you and them so you so the relationship energy connection whatever words we're going to use with that uh, is, not impeded or slowed down and we're talking something like, that that's good yes okay foreign and then the more always starts to show the more of the more of them the more of them the more of the situation and potentially the more of whatever words come through me um are we back yeah listen to the video your video froze but you're back now I see me yeah so I don't know you dropped off for a few minutes and Susan we lost you too Susan for a few minutes please repeat Susan okay, um where was I so the more always shows the more that maybe the more of the client the more of the situation the more of what comes through me I'm sorry Susan please stand by is that coming okay there we are okay, and so uh Brad we are showing seeing camera two I see it all right I think we're back okay, so Susan so Susan yes settling of the name connecting uh a sense feeling of a relationship potential okay now where are we continue, well again like Elaine said it's a not getting in the way letting go and continuing to clear so that the more can show, and the more can show without me getting in the way that there's always more that wants to show, hour but letting which stare at that moment show, yes in whatever form it's showing yeah that means people uh sometimes you sort of, hear things in your in your in your in your thing you get images some people some people just a, knowingness kind of thing so there's different ways this communication goes, on no, big deal there okay but you don't want to say to everyone and you'll hear something because they'll be I don't hear anything no maybe you'll, view things maybe the picture of them at a better level of them will be a little clearer to you whatever okay so for that for that and continuing Susan moving into sensing here I believe okay, okay and what sensing, finer levels of sensing where are we foreign a place where I'll find myself either asking a question or saying something, that I have no uh preconceived notion of asking so something comes through that is I don't know I brought forth um something comes through that's, relevant to the person and again it's not something that I thought about or preconceived idea or question it's just they are being prevented through yes being presented yeah okay all right and in the sensing room could I add we don't have to think about that or worry about that if you've done that you you've carried too much of the Thinker into this bigger right or what I was trying to tell uh San Jose I'm sorry Andrew, Andrew, uh Andrew sounds like you're carrying uh the negative doubter into a larger space and you can't do that you've gotta you've got to learn to clear that one to move along clear that to move along you, can't retain a small thing in the middle of this bigger thing it screws it up it's like you're carrying cancer into a healthy cell I don't know how to word this but you got the sense so, okay and finer sensing Susan go ahead I'm sorry Sensei we seem to have lost her uh she's up in the hills so yeah [Music], she's back yeah okay I don't know if there's just again there's a there's a flow of dialogue that like Elaine said is, very natural the process is, just astoundingly natural and progresses in a natural course yeah and the distance factor I don't know how important this is but the distance Factor seems to change where it's not they're way over there and you're listening to them and it's flowing uh there seems to be a more of a coming together kind of joining yes a blend and overlay blend maybe yeah, yeah where you're present with them experiencing sensing which being shown or presented from their system yes no yes, yes you want to finish up that's good that's it that's what I got for the moment how about how about this revealed illuminated and, resounded again resounded if you come up with words again, are you throwing out a bunch of words again no, what are you doing it sounded like a bunch of words to me I don't know how much we need them I know you like the words but let's stay with the experience what were to crop up in the experience how about that okay I don't want to go up to a dictionary mind or maybe somebody should do that sometimes but not now here let's say and maybe I'm totally wrong and you're totally right but it's my show let's move along okay oh God oh God one more one more uh people who daily deal with people uh Justin, okay, your prep your prep before you sit down with the patient client, for me this, starts way, before the dog is on let's throw those dogs out sorry, go ahead I uh I, I start my day uh by first sitting and um connecting with or inviting a certain amount of space to see what's there for me okay me okay settling past the thinking brain and the feeling brain until there's more of a sense of core self-available okay not always great but just to, start my day with, that reference point if you will okay for me for me consistency has been very important so I, refresh that, basic settling and opening past these different brains um often so fast forward client or patient comes in, I am already sustaining some amount of a little bit of feeling maybe because we're welcome to the center and there's some interaction but into that zone of, sensing availability presence very quickly okay here we're, vibing um we're both sharing some, space and it feels like we're resonating or vibing together okay uh when more, of this sensing is available to me say that again last part how are we doing so far I think okay uh could you give us some examples of when you begin the beginning of sensing with the patient client sure so um as definitely as um both Elaine and Susan have, mentioned there's information that's available um abundant information that's, not obvious to the thinking or feeling brain it seems to be coming from their system and from the space that we're sharing it I get impressions from the client on levels that are not obvious sometimes to them meaning somebody comes in they're a marathon runner they're coming in with knee pain this, came up today and, it becomes obvious oh they're, pushing off too hard with that leg very subtle to them and they wouldn't realize it's a maybe just a couple of percentages different than, the usual but it's created some strain on that side and it's not the knee itself it's, the way they're using their mouth yeah and they wouldn't know it is the knee pain because I didn't warm up did I strain something is it a pre-existing injury no, immediately it's obvious yeah not because I know it but because it's there's an impression oh this they're pushing off too hard with that leg and that's a factor it's a the knee pain is secondary there's a rude or original thing behind that so this is that line of communication where if other healers were there they'd say how'd you know that because it's not obvious how do you know that they, don't and the client doesn't, know yeah they're not working with that level of precision, to know well if my foot is off by a degree or two it's not obvious unless you're performing at a level but it, takes a toll it's not the knee at all per se it's this other thing that's just known, yeah and continue with that next level so, this is very typical with the physical ailments of one kind or another but what I find interesting specifically are with clients that have mental emotional behavioral challenges of one kind or another in their development they're stuck somewhere and again the, origins of, where this is coming from is not always known to the client but this um when we're vibing together in the sensing realm the sensing realm yeah so Impressions come up whereby I might know oh there's a behavior that's inherited by the, grandparent of this person did this kind of thing and now they've inherited unconsciously a, historical cultural you know tendency that wasn't obvious to them because it's from a few Generations back so to say it's there and they don't even know it's there they don't know that why do I have this outlook on the world well they couldn't help her say knowing, that it was being inherited by previous generations or whatever and this is just their propensity now yeah so again people what we're saying here is in this finer dimension of sensing and finer there's a wealth of information we're just scratching the surface here okay we're trying to give you but by doing this saying oh it's not just his knee he's saying how the uh the family uh lineage thing is potentially interfering in this case uh we're and we're still just scratching the surface what about past lives okay it could be the you know it's funny thing it comes up whereby a person might be pushing themselves physically in a way, but the origins of that may not be physical at all they may be lining up to their equality of power or some other thing that's driving them and they're not quite positioned well with that um and that energy or how they're lining up to energy for performance in this way is getting bottlenecked somehow um so at this level you can begin to see a Susan, and I had one uh all right I like the races and laid it out this other time Susan and I were talking and uh so again she deals with physical, uh, although the doctors are sending her a lot of non-physical patients because they, know she's doing something they're not sure what but they're, not sure what but they're sending the difficult patience to her where okay one level of cheat of course she's trained physical, therapist Next Level sensing Marty energy stuff before finer to mention that next level and then suddenly uh one day she was picking up the family involvement with this patient client if there's something from the family that was affecting them for the problem she had to deal with so it went from then physically to them with their family to what Justin is saying uh about families like yes, that, that is the show and again we're just scratching the surface so let's say you all believe in reincarnation what about past life carryovers okay so I make a joke about my shoulders my rotator cuffs get tore up pretty good uh, I've been mutilated through a few lives in my shoulders I got speared in the shoulder I got shot in the shoulder uh so I'm delicate with shoulders okay uh anyway and on and on and on and on the see as we sense we're getting in the area of a self, to self and self retain the memory of everything they've experienced so at a good level of self connecting with another level of self which is a wealth of information there okay the self carries a wealth of information, about the person it's related to is it did I say that okay, was that almost brilliant oh God uh let's get off the healers For a Moment I Saw Denise, Kaufman are you on yes I'm here I just was the thing you did Bob I'm sorry oh I was staying muted hold on okay let's, get away from the healers or a bit in your history of being on stage, can we use the word sensing one night on stage you were in a nice level we could call it the sensing level, we could call it the sensing level what did you sense about I don't know you playing the band The Audience I don't know but you were at a sensing level tell us about that at that level there was no division the band kind of went from sometimes it feels more like individuals and that communication well can be okay but or even good but it's different when the band feels like one unit like one box one year yes yeah and then and then I'm just when you said that a particular, um, you know a particular show came up for me and, uh I was singing a song and yeah playing bass and singing a song and um, and, the band was we were like one unit and then the audience just you know became a circuit a circuit that, started to flow yeah and everybody was singing together all of you are one thing here at this point yeah and those are a wow night right a magic night yeah, I'm you know and you can come and go and yeah you know one of my really good friends Steve kimock who's a really wonderful guitarist and he you know he's a lot of people will film a band and they'll even show that up like on screens or things like that and he always says I never want to see the band I just want the cameras on the audience no well I see the band I know the you know but it's just like the kind of tune into what you know especially if it's a kind of a darker place you can't see too far but it's like to actually feel the energy of the people that have come you know that's, the most and let me jump in on that to feel the energy okay good, and to feel the energy it's a finer level of feeling yeah okay yeah, uh and some people may hear the repercussions of the drum uh and yeah that feeling but that's heavy duty man that's not what I'm talking about right it's a finer level of feeling and then we continue we get into sensing and then they're, more Dimensions or finer, finer of sensing yeah okay we all right with that thank you thank you we have to get away from all those healers out there a different approaches ah yeah I was uh okay uh my history for a while I was a, dog whisperer uh, and it just sort of happened uh so I don't remember my warm-up but basically sitting settling there's the dog uh the people say okay we got a problem with this dog uh and if I recall it's been a lot of years back if I recall just basic settling opening of course dog me, dog and very quickly it would happen uh where it suddenly click I don't even know if there was a click but something and, I would mentally say to the dog what's up here and the dog would talk to me is in that sense I could like hear the words okay talk to me it was kind of fun I was kind of good at it at the time uh I remember when Great Pyrenees uh female I belonged to this Great Pyrenees club and uh, they picked her up at the pound or something uh because Great Pyrenees people don't like their dogs to end up in a dog pound so anyway she, came out of nowhere and uh the person who's taking care of her knew something was a little bit off so she called me in something's off with this dog uh and I said Hi how are you to the dog and what's up and uh, what's your problem or something and this is a Great Pyrenees and she said and I broke up she said I'm afraid I said of what of everything, this is a Great Pyrenees they fight wolves and bears they're tough so, funny here grape Pyrenees I'm afraid of everything she broke me up anyway this was a very easy very natural okay, uh no uh no, great effort but I think because you know I'm into my work even though this is way back into the settling and opening and, like beginnings of sensing could I say and it was just there it was just there so, anyway my dumb example ah so sensing, said okay anybody else, have an experience that we could attribute to a sensing level mics are open [Applause] sensing level uh Sensei Bob here hey about there I got a business example I was working with an insurance company and we were calling on a client it was a large food processor that we were hoping to get their business and it was a company that was owned by a Japanese company and the Japanese, company and the Japanese company had a close relationship with the Japanese insurance company who was insuring these guys so I, knew just from that, this was going to be difficult to get them away yeah, yeah so I said okay what can really are what can we really offer these people and you go through okay well maybe our price will be lower well that'll be a thinking thing uh maybe we can offer a little better service some way that'll be a feeling thing but thing but they had, a fire and they were really unhappy with how the Japanese company had handled the claim so that that's when the sensing part came in and I brought some stuff in with me some wire codes and things like that, I had never done before with a client ever in 40 years you brought it in beforehand yeah, and I went over it with them and then they brought in a couple other guys to listen to what I was saying and they actually had to go back to the board of directors in Japan to allow them to change insurance companies because they didn't want to leave their Japanese insurance company because they were a Japanese company but they did and we got this 600 000 account because of that, cool, so sensing level in a business sense so you don't have to be a Healer or a dog whisperer or whatever, everything and anything is what I'm trying to pre-present a musician dog talker business whatever it see the sensing is uh, in the realm of self, senses could I say, okay, get more people into a self level or a sensing self-experience level uh there's some cool things that can go on okay business music plants animals whatever, okay, that's where I say everything talks okay, yeah everything talks we just have to get to a better level of hearing what anything and everything is saying, so that's why we're playing with sensing is that, which said not bad I think nope well essentially this is Lauren I just like to add one along the same lines as uh Noah just now and uh you know many people understand that I work sometimes as uh, Japanese English, Japanese interpreter for business negotiations uh, you know I don't have the most complete vocabulary in the world I'm not the most fluent Japanese speaker in the world, but I believe that my Aikido training helps me what in Japanese would be called read the air and so if I made a you know you know business negotiation whether that's at in front of you know on two sides of a table or you know at a restaurant drinking, so much of it is uh when to speak when to stay silent what to translate what to not Translate does the person understand or do you need to repeat and it's body language it's hesitation it's timing it's not it's rare that they somebody raises their hand and says I don't understand yeah I don't want to be embarrassed for it no but even for the Americans and so the uh that's very much a unspoken invisible sensing yeah you know when it and when you do it right everybody doesn't notice nobody notices right and when you miss you sense it wrong you know the you know things Collide so it's you know but uh it's very much like what Noah said too yeah, and again people there are many levels so there are those that are we can observed person or whatever you're saying the person's getting a little Twitchy they're a little nervous Twitchy and you go oh something's not right uh but you saw that fine no problem but finer levels and finer levels reading the air was that the expression uh and it's not an overt eyeball that's a good phrase reading the air sensing The Vibes going on and finer sensing of that going on and right there I'm saying it's potentially Unlimited we're just barely scratching the surface what's fun this is exciting no laughs, and really useful uh makes being a human a little more fun and potentially a little easier uh, maybe an easy way to keep developing and growing because with sensing we're starting to Tapped itself and when the cells start to come more alive even in the uh manifest world uh that's, pretty cool that's a that's a good lead jump goodly jump another topic there somebody the mics are open anything you've experienced that you feel like was a sensing level and again there are many levels of sensing so hey Bob this is Catherine, hi, um I'm in the middle of it right now I am preparing to uh facilitate a high-stakes Retreat uh starting Sunday and then Monday and Tuesday and it involves many people it involves expectations of a funder there's an outcome couple of outcomes that need to occur so that's the framework and as I work on the agenda I get, um, very strong feelings of flow so the client tells me what they need I then take and I begin to have conversations with all of the participants whom I haven't yet met yet I also have a conversation I could clarify that for the people in the wrong space you have conversations with them not on the phone not in person no okay oh no your self herself is, talking to the other selves that are important uh people in this meeting you can do that people okay yes go ahead I just wanted to clarify it thank you yeah because I sometimes I just don't know how to describe it but I know what I think welcome to the club yeah I know I know it's really befuddling sometimes um I also this group of selves contribute to a total self and I talked to the total self that's all of ourselves combined and say what is it you would like me to do so that the voice, uh group vote a group in accord yeah kind of um because the self the big, self that encompasses all of us um, is asking of us to show up for the and I'm going to have to use a business term the outcome and uh the outcome makes will make a huge difference on a pretty critical issue in this state so um I can't talk about all of that but um, I, talked to the entity that is uh and the, space that we're going to be in talks to me as well oh yeah the room tells me the best way to use it and it also points out when um I should split the group up to maybe some go outside some go in the lobby you know things like that so let me jump in for a second because you just said something else since they said uh, in his fight with the naval Captain which was the big where he was really in a hell of a fancy space uh he said it's like the room told him where to move he was just walking around this guy's pissed off and Swinging he's going to get him he's pissed do you think so Sensei is putting him down because he, wasn't even holding a sword or a bokeh and whatever and just walking around casual and the guy couldn't hit him he said it that way he said it's like the room was telling him oh here it comes let's move over here so anyway I just want to say oh I just heard that phrase go ahead sorry um yeah I, think that is you know the, most I can articulate around well then I need to type it into a agenda so I ask for support around how do I best articulate this so okay we're gonna have a dialogue hey dialogue what, kind of questions should I, mean I kind of talk to each part of the agenda as well, so you're asking the group of selves let's call it entities I think you call it asking them what can I present it to you in the physical world that would catch your attention or whatever yeah and most engage you most help you make it's like how can I set the stage so each of the participants is their best character for the task at hand I, think that's in part what I try to do or I, don't do it um yeah but I set the stage and if I open and create the space powerfully enough then they just have a blast because they've never had anything quite like this um in terms of, digging deep I guess if you will part of part of I don't know if it came across clear uh with our medical people but part of uh moving into finer level if you're making space for yourself to be a better level of yourself sensing but also you're including them and when they're in a better space they can gush things out to you that they've never told anyone else or they may not even know about they forgot about it let's say or they didn't even know that existed but here it comes because uh this opening made it easier for them it's kind of like I think a really advanced level would be a therapist who catches on to this space and space with the patient where the therapist just sits there and the patient gushes out all the truths so the therapist doesn't have to dig for them and go through some dumb questions and whatever uh were they just are gushed out from self to the person to you self something like that anyway Endless Possibilities people endless is that it my dear I think so and, you just, gave me this little nice gem here where we have to put we scenarios for the future so it's not so much like the therapist you know like finding the truth it's like each of them being able to gush out these Amazing Ideas and thoughts and phrases and so it's a real form of creativity so um I appreciate that last comment Bob that was really helpful yeah see, again using me as an example uh I, come from and not that well-educated family uh probably only a couple of us got through high school I made it to a year or whatever Junior College uh I was top educated in my family uh, you know artwork in my house my joke is was a calendar, okay I come from working class uh, and so I know my limitations as a brain thinker any intelligence you see is not so much Bobby he's kind of Street smarter a little bit uh but comes from this work this tapping more and then more comes out, okay it can naturally happen so uh, you said something about uh how you alluded to, that uh with the potential even Brilliance can come out but let's start someplace let's get at least some common sense coming out but whatever yes this inner work then uh it's more artistic it's smarter it's more harmonious it's whatever it's an endless possibility here people that's all I've been trying to tell you these years okay and a few tricks of how to easy the ah hey how to settle down how to open up uh, I know a lot of people have fear of the underworld so I've got to explain what that is and come on let's, be okay with it because it really is it's more than okay it's great but a lot of people don't know that and they stay away from it and they're not grounded and they start to spin more and on and on and on so there's a few things we have to cover but not to make this experience this trip we're on more difficult few tricks a few tricks of the trade I, call them okay but anyway uh it you were stumbling over how to explain uh oh Sensei says from his level it was god-awful trying to explain so he would sometimes I, call it wax poetically uh he didn't know quite how to present his level to this level he said in essence you can't okay, uh, it's almost like a it's not almost like it's a I don't know what to call it a different universe that he was in it wasn't an upgraded this universe this universe we get upgrade boom, and you get smarter and stronger and faster and all of that that's upgrading in this world okay, and I said they cut around now oh that's fine that's fine it's squared away get balanced now but don't go on and on and on and on and on with it because it does go on and on and on that way but he was able to catch on to something very important there, where he could I don't know how to say it move from this world into another world and still be present in this world, and still be present in this world but being in the other world that's why the naval Captain couldn't hit him and he's just walking around the naval Captain was in this world and he was damn good in this world okay so he was damn good okay, uh physically and all of that uh since they said almost Ezekiel he's in the center that was a little bit better at that level but only a little bit but you got to be careful when you get two guys at the same level like that what they call it in Japanese I, Uchi ayuchi a mutual kill they're both so good when one is cutting the other he's being cut they both die Western Cowboys had the same thing two fast guns they weren't sure they wanted to do that because the chances were both of them would die it was that close uh so we have a western form of ayuchi uh so he was at that level in this world uh with that guy he shifted worlds and he did it fairly, well and that's where uh, to explain where he was at the golden Vapors gushing and all of that, was in the world he was in it wasn't just something that happened five minutes later at the well it just was explaining to him you were in a hell of a world let's show you what a fancy world you're in because you may not have noticed you were there you did well but let's show you the more of it that you didn't notice could I say it's my words anyway so anyway so I present upgrading capabilities balance Harmony the centered character we have the circle types how we have to get a sense of both that will facilitate we need to square away uh harmonize balance then and sense of self then comes the potential to be able to do with oh Sensei said okay all right all right so this is very important it's one by the two by the three by is important I'm not saying you got to go to a 10 by and a 15 by and a 20 by no you don't have to do that okay but a Bobby is going to be hard-pressed a Robert sort of anado well we're getting closer now, I'm not though if it's cool maybe we're getting close, when you realize there is a self and the self is actually present when you catch that you can add self-sense scent finer now that's a potential but that's, enough said enough said okay ah I went off on a tangent there I think where the hell are we people we got a couple of minutes here if you want uh essentially Bob here yeah I can remember even from the days when you first came back from Japan and you talked about your experiences training, at the kotokon with top of the line guys like Uso mafune who was one of the greatest well I didn't train with him you saw him there, yeah and uh Nakayama at the jka and Wong XI Jin and you said you can see the progression that these guys went through and that if you spent the amount of time they spent you would go through the same progression but what oh Sensei did was something that didn't have that kind of linear yeah it wasn't limited to them it was yeah I, could Envision developing okay, and because I'm, a training fool in those days like I'm a good trainer I could develop uh but outside was showing some level I don't know if that's the right word uh but this thing that he was able to be present in that was like what the hell is that I gotta get there that kind of thing yeah and so developing a more physical strength or faster movement yeah a little bit because I'm still young and Genki uh but uh realizing that, wasn't going to do it so when I hear the Japanese some of the Japanese studs say those census got 50 years in when I get 50 years in I'm I might be as good as those Sensei I would laugh to myself ain't gonna happen because they're doing the Improvement level and again yes we need some to catch how it works get a sense of things and then we can move into because of that balance Harmony balance and that picking up that there's a self here and self-sensing uh getting close getting close okay which is different than continuing to a five by five a six by six or seven a, 12 by 12. uh that's a that's good but it's a different pattern I don't know if I said it well and are we getting ahead of blah, people any comments before we finish up here experience I have a question yeah when oh Sensei was with that Captain and I think I was with that with the oh the naval Captain yeah the bow can yeah when he moved into that space of the room beckoning him or showing him where to go or, um things in the room would talk to him would, he still be aware that the bow can was coming for him or there was there a place in him he was aware of something but it wasn't like being in the physical world keeping an eye on it right uh but there was an awareness see the action would talk to him, he said when if there was movement in the room uh the room would say it's moving I'm paraphrasing I'm not exactly sure how to say it but uh but if the air moved a bit he he'd be moved a bit he could sense it the room would talk to him kind of thing he said he said it was similar to when the bullets were coming and certainly he said the bullets would talk to him and say hey I'm coming oh and he'd move and they go by uh here it was it was a little bit like that when the guy was swinging uh it was like oh I gotta move now uh but, something like that again now he has trouble describing this because he's in this realm which is very hard if not impossible to describe to people in this realm to use these and meezes, yeah so I'm just trying to say it as clear as he said was that was that, user Missy that would be um, tend to contract if somebody was you know hitting at one there'd be even there'd be some sort of sense of contraction or, meanness, but did he just not even have that apparently he said he said I was like going for a walk we're just going for a casual walk in this room he wasn't on me he wasn't he wasn't on me he wasn't checking him out he says a casual walk but he would be in some form pre-warned or things would happen that he'd go along with best I can say it thank you again we're trying to explain in this world something that is finer than this world I don't mean to find her as we use finer I don't mean oh another dimension uh so see already our words are a little screwy uh or Sensei calls this world we're in linear world he called that world the non-linear world do with that what you want but that's our, way of, dialoguing in, the linear World sensei in an unlinear world uh so that's our one way we map with, each other ah so anyway so anyway uh so yeah you're all going to have trouble explaining when you're coming even from a good sensing level uh sort of what you're doing when other people say what are you doing there uh how did you know that why'd you know to do that uh could have to make up some words to make them happy I don't know what to say here uh nothing else going and do it show it whatever uh us you know Sensei I have the uh the, the, first time it was written in English uh version of uh of the story oh sensei's I, could read it if you wished okay we're running towards the end so just a short piece yeah as his study progressed osensei development developed a type of sixth sense with, which he could fail the intended movements of the opponent okay when he was trapped when he was traveling in Mongolia he was held up at the point of a Mauser pistol okay hold it there hold it there oh Sensei said uh yes there are sense senses okay but this realm that he could move into uh it's not a finer sensing Realm finer sensing is done in this realm and, we'll have a session on that uh, to go over that uh you know we can improve our sense of smelling by playing dimensional it can prove as we did with the feeling boom Oh, uh so see that's not a right word because people are going to get locked into senses and what I was Sensei really did was pass that pass that so go ahead I just want to clarify I think I think the translator came up with the words use the word sixth sense to make clear that it was not one of the physical senses but any case I think and even though Sensei said to me I know some people allude to a sixth sense but I'm not talking about that okay sorry but I gotta if I gotta tell you what I hear from those Sensei best I can, okay, [Music], so he's in Mongolia he was conscious that the opponent's intention to shoot became a small spiritual bullet which went through him before the opponent actually pulled the trigger then with a rapid movement he stepped to the opponent's side a split second before the gun fired then he threw him and gained possession of the weapon this is a well-known episode amongst people who are interested in aikida yeah having returned to ayabe the master devoted himself to his previous lace-up study and concentrated his mind to learn more deeply the secret of budo the spring of 1925 a Navy officer a professor of fencing a Kendo sensei, visited the master and asked to become a student then during a conversation they happened to disagree over a trifle matter, tempers Rose they agreed to have a fight foreign I'm laughing because based on nothing they got so angry with each other that they agreed to whip out their bow cannons and strike each other the officer dashed forward to strike him swinging his witness sword but that's the master dodged his sword very easily each time the officer finally sat down without having once touched it the master says he felt the opponent's movements before they were actually executed in the same way as during his time in Mongolia yeah Jason yeah he took a rest after this play and went over to a nearby Garden in which there was a persimmon tree as he was wiping off the perspiration from his face he was greatly overcome with a feeling which he had never experienced previously he could neither walk nor sit he was just rooted on the ground in great astonishment the master recalls his experience and then he quotes and so no sense a quote and that'll be the end I set my mind on Buddha when I was about 15 and visited teachers of fencing and Jiu Jitsu of various provinces I mastered the secrets of early sex each within a few months but there was no one to instruct me in the essence of budo which could Satisfy My Mind so I knocked on the gates of various religions but I couldn't get any concrete answers then in the spring of 1925 if I remember correctly when I was taking a walk in the garden by myself I felt that the Universe suddenly quaked and that a golden Spirit sprang up from the ground veiled my body and changed my body into a golden one at the same time my mind and body became light I was able to understand the whispering of the birds and was clearly aware of the mind of God the creator of this universe at that moment I was enlightened the source of budo is God's love the spirit of loving protection for all beings endless tears of joy streamed on my cheeks, since that time I had grown to feel that the whole earth is my house and the Sun the moon and the stars are all my own things he likes to wax poetically I'm getting enough thank you thank you thank you just have to be careful of interpretation you know I had a strong mind whatever it's the somebody said no not a strong mind you see that could throw people out with a really concentrate on being aware or something no, no, no, so, always the interpretations are going to be a little yeah, and again oh since I said to try to talk about that level the people in this level even though they're Advanced or well trained or whatever he says damn it's like if it isn't impossible it borders on impossibility okay so that's when it works poetically stuff anyway enough I wanna be closed Sensei by saying that for all its imperfections which I didn't know at the time in 1974 when I bought this book and read about it, was That's What attracted me most was the possibility that, could happen yeah, yeah, thank you that's what the raw, books are for my rah-rah book was uh not a yogi uh no what was my rah-rah book um thank you autobiography that was my raw, book I wasn't a heavy meditator lightly uh but I'd read a

and so uh i think we're ready to go and um nope, where is i see so uh actually due to technical difficulties beyond our control we are momentarily delayed, and so and so somebody have a good story to tell a joke justin one night when i was training with bob this is probably in my first year he came over to train with me for a minute and i, was not doing very well but i had an excuse very quickly and i just said well i'm really out of it tonight, and bob said yes but it is still there i'm out of it but it's still there okay anybody else have a joke basically we've had to do a restart of the computer at sensei's house so here it comes here we come so some people didn't hear me say it before but we will not have nado sensei will not have a virtual class next friday the 24th christmas eve and we will not have a virtual class 31st new year's eve so the next two fridays no virtual class i'll send that as email as well but uh please uh, be aware that that's the plan and uh i think okay ready okay ready here we go oh no, riggs, gosh hello joel sensei you're on and we're joined by joel riggs from atlanta oh, hey joe hey joe leave you today hello everybody tj jesus here right here that tree that fell in your yard yeah it's called firewood is that right yeah you want some because we're not burning up here anymore we haven't checked our fireplace yet so yeah, yeah fire, would yes if you'll split it tj i'll take it well i got the chainsaw that's about it i used to cut firewood with my sister up in the auburn hills that was fun i understand susan pence is really good at that maybe uh oh yes now she's champion yes i don't think she has a splitter though i don't know yeah we had a splitter we were really fancy it takes us it takes a spike and a 20 pound hammer you know on a long pole so, uh, oh in the uh i'll repeat this before we finish but uh if you want to write about anything your insights observations how things are going uh questions uh you've got a couple of weeks to, do that lauren they have the information for that don't they yes i just announced no class uh next week and no class the week after and i will send uh, an email address which is basically my gmail address uh i'll send that around okay, uh, what are we tonight core as an energizer a healer a responder let's see if you remember i looked uh through all the paperwork i have uh to find the old, core, core, core, uh diagram i couldn't find it but just to remind you so that's for example a starting chord as we develop, as we move into finer the finer of a core can show so the first chord is that like a rough lineage of it uh physical chords what the people in the gyms, are talking about core work and uh and uh when they get that physical plexus core uh the body should be a little stronger a little more adaptable to the body things okay so there's the sort of the beginning of core as we move into finer dimensions of core uh then i know i'm going to have you jump in here in a moment we did for example the chinese tai chi levels of core uh bob could you say something about an earlier tai chi level core and then we'll get into a closer to the master core, core all right placing the mind at center of what the chinese called the dantian and gathering your chi there your energy there, okay, so it's an energy source okay so we're back to uh energizer or energy source okay uh, as the in tai chi as they uh develop more they become almost masters anything about the core at that level uh it becomes a place in which the two forces which they usually look at as fire and water come together okay and we have different names for fire water uh we could bring the center circle forces the great he forces the great two in the manifest have different names that we could use but anyway a, finer uh, level that has more going for it yeah yes that's right i'm gonna try to jump the game uh i'm gonna present a possibility here for you all to play with and that's instead of continuing with this core and a little bit bigger finer core and then a little bit bigger finer core uh that we just talked about uh the uh the uh physical plexus core and then noah's two levels of energy coral of tai chi um the trees did you won't add anything there did we miss anything just for a basic and core yeah it's also considered the like a bio battery it's definitely an energy what you're talking about is energizer, it is definitely a place that uh can kind of collect and store key store prana g by any name yeah, it's a it's a it's a reservoir of, uh presence and energy okay a good source yeah great source noah said it beautifully and not when they need lux out right no he's man he's the man ah okay i'm gonna try to up it a little bit someplace here tonight let me get my act together here let's see, uh, so instead of keeping it sort of here which is okay to start with we all start there uh but i'd like to not get stuck for year after year at a certain level like getting stuck for 10 years at a physical plexus level and then another 10 years as a as an early practitioner of tai chi or what whatever and goes on and on and on uh we have to people learn to i don't know cut to the chase zip through this these dimensional walls they're not really walls uh or since i would say i just had to catch things there's no time or space uh a big jump for you but anyway we have to pick up the pace here so that i'm gonna i think i'm gonna try to lay that out a bit tonight so where should we start [Music] let's okay let's say there's a core there and we're just starting uh cold or fresh um, it's there everybody everyone has one but maybe it's been dormant uh or you've been dormant or we've been so tightly wrapped up uh that we're not aware of, it as we settle and open ah, core, now to now to activate it ah i mean it itself is active but i'm a dunderhead so i want to start the process going [Applause], okay, bob mentioned the fire water pattern uh, for me it's fire up and water down as you get that harmony of an up down beat using fire water uh it starts to activate or show that it's there bob is that okay say it that way we can't hear you bob yes that's it that okay yeah yes okay you could activate it with any two so breathing, and then reference that that's in the middle in this case the core okay so you breathe for a while in harmony, when you feel a certain level of harmony reference the core you could chant it i don't know we were doing before time uh i think ah to the o, to the ah so there's a sound vibration there and that could be an activator, in the harmony of auto o and o to ah or reverse if you like it begins to activate show that it's there begins to glow whatever the words are okay are we okay so far yeah, we're okay, uh i'd like to get to the point here where, the core isn't something here but this line this line here so this is red and this is red uh, that's fine to start with to warm up and get a little finer fine great cool, uh but i wonder if we have a sense of [Applause] of the core as being a fuller so if you have an idea not an idea way out there or a cord tightly here but let's position it idea sends a note to its partner the energies the energies react back okay [Applause], and to keep that more here so you have to range way out there about an idea here i can have an idea or a problem yeah i'd like to be calmer we did calm an idea of calm help and the energy start to react and if you remember, i believe most of you all of you got calmer, okay so there's a relationship of the idea to the energy we might call that body mind harmony okay i don't like the word body per se in that sense i like energy stuff, uh some any, other words but body is true body kind of thing okay, but the big sense of mind body based on an original two forces the great idea and the great stuff that followed that idea the original or more original big two, where the hell am i going instead of being over here over here over here having an idea, about a core better than nothing [Applause] and an idea about the energies reacting position ourselves in the in the middle of it you're it you're it idea to the energies and the say we're playing with calmness again and the calmness that begins to happen is here is here okay it's not oh it's calm around me or oh i'm aware of little calmness it's, here okay i'm trying to get us to the point where, uh the sense of core isn't this that you are the core there hold that phrase i think i think that's close you are the core the core is you and with a balanced core finer level the character is better and eventually finer and finer you realize, through that it's a self okay so anyway i'm trying to get it [Applause], bigger present here anything coming across am i am i almost laying this out right as a start and say deja here hey uh yeah i'm, hearing you talk about that is the core as dimensional it has a dimensional yes definitely that yes and we went there from the uh plexus core to the level of energy using tai chi as an example to a finer level, of energy using more of a master tai chi as an example so yeah it's dimensional yes go ahead okay that's no that's that was just, when i'm looking at the diagram the small red circle in the big red circle are not it's not two-dimensional it's multi-dimensional yeah no kind of big circle out there yeah interior finer here yeah, and the radian the radiance of that of that sphere is, kind of pictured in your diagram there and from that level of sphere, seer, uh, it would still radiate that's where you might people around you would be touched by your calmness or your [Applause], whatever good quality is there your mix your mix they would be affected by it so uh so we'd have radiations off of that uh, affecting the world potentially, are they blipping in or off who is that uh, anyway open mic somebody where, the hell am i i'm, that's people joining sensei, that's nice no, leaving once you're on your you're stuck there uh this is amy hey amy from oakland i gotcha i saw your face there okay amy from yes i've been working a lot with this and i think the process the way that i'm experiencing it is exactly how you've laid it out there's like a uh the process i go through a body feeling so i feel my body i feel like my extremities and then it goes more centered and into this center point and i feel like there's like this opening but it only feels as big as my body and then i try to be it and when i'm actually it, goes beyond my body yeah, i want to sort of kick out the i try to be it part and help us realize we're it this isn't some experiment i'm playing with out there that i'm aware of and i read a book about it ask myself i do have to ask like is this me is this real is this what i'm is that me and then that usually is like the question that i ask leads me into it yeah so it's not that i try it's yeah no i ask yeah, uh, and when i said uh wasn't a put down or anything like that it was just let's pick up the pace if possible here uh but what you said sounds like um what i would call double checking see it felt pretty good really, oh yes really and so that, next beat oh yeah really this is this is more tangible, yeah it's not that big the next beat something so yeah sometimes i do find it hard to maintain in that space so i often get distracted or the things you know and then i have to remind myself wait a minute where are you let's come back so there's this constant like ebb and flow back and forth and remember the basics, as we open dimensionally there's more juice there and the juice can push can push and so it's no surprise they were suddenly lofting out there someplace okay or instead of more uh pumps on the experience we have the awareness of it and then still awareness and there's that push and i get aware further out okay so that's why i keep pushing on get some depth get some roots get a uh so that you're more here and you don't get pushed out so readily, it's just a concept or awareness of the push factor is very high okay, and that's why i stress the awareness of it is just a part of it people gotta have this experience the, partner to, the idea the presentation that's that line the idea takes sends a message responds to who play and this response okay, so we didn't make up our vsp the system did, okay, but i do want to just add one final thing that like when you've said to give it a question or to talk to it in, not like there's enough maybe i'm aware but i could ask myself am i aware or am i it and that always brings me back so that the questioning aspect has been really great for me yeah i try to do a similar thing uh i kind of have more ingrained in my system the idea and oh i'm going to add a new rule here the one to five rule amy do you know what that is have i used that before no one idea but for the responding energies uh we should hang with them especially at first to really get good at this to five pumps of the experience five pumps five pumps five pumps so the experience is really kind of full if you just do an idea and, i i'm experiencing it's possible you're aware of an experience that awareness is tricky uh so it doesn't hurt for me to double check and for you the way that you double check because awareness would like to take everything over knowing that we double checked so that's where i came up with the one to five one, presentation to five beats five beats and the five could be ten fifteen uh but just to where it's really whoa it's, experiential it's experienced so one to five rules people you all got that you jot that down one to five it's not that the thank you amy that the energies are, dumb or something but they're i don't know what to say they're a little slower i think i tried to lay that up in years for years is saying i can think about kawaii pretty fast and start to get a scent, of this of the flowers the pleasantness of being on the on the ocean beach i can do that in a moment now to actually experience it i got to pack my bags buy a ticket go to the airport on and on and on and so it has a different timing at first so i don't think that because it's so slower it's dumber or anything like that it's just i don't know let's just say that's how, it is the idea is fast and the energies are ah take a little bit more and more energies okay, one to five b is that okay that, thanks yeah and when you understand an idea or you're presented with an idea or you read a book about something that's very good very good but you have to know immediately without really having to think about it now the experience of that to experience that word or presentation and give it some beats one to five at least to experience it okay remember the awareness is cute it'll be aware of an experience which is not the experience it's just it's nature it's the way things are okay so, where am i going what are we trying to do here trying to get i'm trying to get one thing the awareness, part here i'm aware of all of that and trying to get more of the experience, uh, to experience what is happening so as those uh presentation energies responding starting to harmonize boom, that in that finer dimension that you're in that it's experienced again and then it's experienced as, you as, you not i'm aware of that going on over here it's close so i can kind of feel it and i think i'm really experiencing it but you're close you're not it itself experiencing itself trying to think about let's go back to the calm we had an idea i'd like to be calmer uh okay and then it responded and it's responding it's responding fuller because we're opening more or whatever, and suddenly there's an experience of calmness, okay not an idea about but the actual experience okay that, that, is now the whole field so if you were to stand it's calmness standing i am calm calmness stance so that whole unit is me personal present, an experiential fact not an awareness about it as a fact an experiential fact help me here people i'm dying the holidays this is justin with uh justin thank you thank you justin go ahead, the pressure's on now so this reminds me of um when, when, we're a body that's, moving with a fuller center a core the whole body is moving in a coordinated integrated fashion rather than arms and legs could be being is coordinated within its space with a full core uh and maybe like you were saying there's also a sense of deep roots there too another piece maybe but yeah so let me interject uh so a chinese tai chi format would be a certain level core the arms are moving freer okay, a better level core starts to include the legs after the legs also move freer a little bit more of that and you get a good centered presence where both feet and hands can move freeer so yes, yes i just want to get out of core as something within and, this sense of you're the core as we continue you are you're the core i just want to try to get that flavor don't know if i'm saying it well but i want to present the idea at least so you have something to play with for the next two weeks if i might add you know i, have the sense that if, we're more fully present as a centered being and our self is more fully engaged within the person within the characters we're more we're more fully present as a as a being a self within the world that we're in and not merely playing a role if you will oh yeah don't me spiritually so, how i see it is that you know our true self our, soul our self is like the driver with inside within the vehicle the person there's the vehicle and then there's the driver you know if i'm not fully engaged as the driver within my vehicle then maybe it's just a beautiful car without a without a driver that's present let me jump in here please help me help me understand well see i don't want to give him a concept of self as a driver they'll they're going to love that concept and they're going to at no end when you get core self is there when you have the character that's there itself is there it's here it's just we're so thick we don't realize it we can learn a word we can about it but that's why we do squared away core squared away anything because in the finer of squared away chord character that the self is there it's there, and as we continue finer and finer itself will begin to show and that's we're heading where we're trying to head by uh going through the dimensions faster so we get to the domain which is really finer, here and self begins to show as self there okay there okay yeah i didn't i didn't mean to go off on a tangent oh i just didn't want to bring that word in too soon with that nice philosophy it's the drive it's a beautiful story don't tell people that i'm the driver ah no they're an with a nice idea right no careful better said thank you sensei i, maybe if i can rephrase that how, engaged are we as a self are we more fully engaged or distant are we let's not even use the word self let's start with what we got let's be a robert character first let's be an adult character first finer core hey, present hey and, we'll get to something when we get to self then we'll really let self talk about itself or experience itself so we've got to be careful of two fancy words too fast because people go off on those words you know since i made some mistakes he knew it uh and he started tightening up a bit uh throwing some words out and people the words and they think they understand the words they got it, and they don't got it they got the words okay so that's why i, do the same thing i throw out some of the words but it's sort of a direction sense but let's not keep bringing them up early in the game when you're a weird bobby don't really bring up the word self it's like yeah we're heading that way but let's deal with, where we are and i'm gonna watch it all move faster through this so we get using that as an example so it's not core, this whole thing is core and the character in it is that level and through that eventually go find her self in the domain damn the words anyway uh thank you justin yeah, uh um i, remember you were one of the first teachers that i ever came across that used the word field as in um uh, you know a field presence a field sense, and i, think that that's what, you're, what um what um when you say like one to five there's a uh there's a sense of uh an embodiment process you're, becoming manifest as a some character and it feels it's more authentic genuine and there's a fuller integrated field sense that's isn't that one of the reasons we do, some of those simple dumb checks yeah, yeah, uh a brad can you come up here a moment and just put your finger lightly on my yeah lightly a little closer okay, a little heavier on the finger be present yeah don't do the finger [Applause], b finger, if he settles then it's finger he's going to do the finger don't give me the finger anyway, uh so it's a simple dumb practice and like, and it's radiating outward okay oops i'm straining a bit so for this amount of pressure, have to be a better level inner finer oh this one there, that was better yeah and he noticed it also which he should do when you're being the opposing you should be doing it in a learning sense not in i'm going to screw you over sets that's a different game we don't play that that's just to give feedback that you're, on the right track okay this should give me feedback just that would give me feedback it's hurting that gives me feedback i'm, i'm heading the wrong way it's inner those energies okay thank you yeah so we do some dumb physical checks uh just to make sure we're heading in the right direction can i say it that, way sean okay yes sensei that's, great that was a perfect example of that fuller integrated field sensibility and sean uh you said embody it i just want to make sure people don't misunderstand it's not uh my bobby body is gonna embody this energy we're starting to get a little wrong there the energy experiencing itself there's a body here that could be called energy body so i don't embody it right no it's an embodiment in experiencing it we could say there's an embodiment i don't know what words to use now but in the experience it's experiencing itself and in an energy field probably going to be an energy body okay, yeah, all right all right thank you sensei and sensei this is lauren just uh just uh remember that uh when you laid out the title for tonight's class you had the before as energizer but also as healer and responder okay we're at the age where healing thing is probably important to a lot of folks okay at any level okay yeah even the core plexus level we know there's a response because they all get better if they're any good they all get better at their bodybuilding there okay so we're getting a feedback at a finer level the energy level is better, finer dimensional energy better and as it radiates could we say radiate can radiate makes its presence here there's a healing capability in there there's a healing capability in there as we go finer in finer, uh the finer i might want to change the words after a while not from energies but to a mixture of your qualities whatever your color scheme is we all have four it's a good, number to use we only have four that we majored in and, we're, using, finer dimensions of energy and eventually it's kind of qualities and at that level the healing capability is even better because the energies are more balanced the qualities are balanced therefore the energies are uh so there's a healing capability there we've had a couple of people i don't think danny's on tonight no he is not no uh, where i'm asking him to go deeper inner, and i have a sense about danny that uh self is not hard for him far from him it's he's his self is kind of cool let's say to get to that level so that level itself closer in the domain and the radiation from there is really has some healing potential okay, is that clear if you remember i didn't jump on danny but i reminded him when he was talking about his acupuncture lady who he really likes and he likes the acupuncture it's like no problem but his wife is a great masseur asus masseuse katya what is it masseuse oh she's getting your license so ah emmanuel there anyway oh jesus that's nice but the massage i don't think he's going to cure his cancer and although he likes the acupuncture he thinks his acupuncture is great it's like good i'm just not sure if it's going to cure cancer but i think finer core level in this case self in the domain uh and that radiates out i'm thinking there is real healing okay that's why i want to bring you all to the domain level if i can because great things can be done there the word is, okay a variety of things can be done there, so healing and for somebody who's uh well, positioned, in that in their domain they might uh be healers just being there, you know where people hang out with them and feel healed oh i gotta heal you it's not a necessarily hands-on thing necessarily hands-on thing necessarily it's just a natural radiation of balance at a very nice level so, healing, okay, uh, if, the domain is a little ahead of where you're at right now and that's okay we're going to head that way in future weeks i hope we have to really, uh, any level of core radiating uh can invigorate can help sparkle you uh, uh oh we oh we knew when the people broke their arms skiing who happened to be aikido's uh let a little energy flow their bones would heal very fast and it was, you'd expect them to say their doctor said oh my god you're healing fast we expected that because they had some energy flow thing energy flow at that level is not a an advanced, core it's just a little bit ah an energy level core and flowing energy okay you've all done, the uh i hate the word unbendable arm the energy arm certain level energies flow boom okay we just use that as a reference okay so at that level energies flow and the bones heal faster okay so it has that healing effect has that energizing effect response responder, within the, figure of core is that law of mind to the body or energies energy's responding back, and eventually also vice versa as a capability am i all over the board tonight where am i help sensei i wanted to jump in again i uh share just a little something that i don't think any of you guys really know but, after, my first year studying aikido if you could even call it studying at that level, i was involved in a rollover car accident at 100 miles an hour on the highway and they had to reconstruct my right hand okay, so, after six weeks in a drainage cast with a hand surgeon saying i might only get 50 use of my hand back the only thing that i did besides see a occupational therapist which i probably should have done was energy extension exercises and weapons gripping, and that's it that's it and i have had and still have a hundred percent use of and all i've done is exactly what you say energy extension and breathing exercises, and that's after one year of aikido practice at a university whatever club level, yeah and for the people that are too heavy oriented it's not just i squeeze and i squeeze i squeeze it a thousand times yeah there'll be a certain amount of energy because of the nature of it that'll respond but to know what you're doing to a bit of inner sensing finer level of view, squeezing, inner finer squeezing and then you can bring in law five and squeezing and squeezing bringing in play the inner work outer did i say that okay it's not just a matter keep training those are the i'm sorry those are the dumb heavies who keep training okay in bodybuilding i used to call them they train for ugly they're training for ugly you know inner beauty boom they get too outer yeah and they thought that was beautiful they're ugly it's inner, inner and you use some others for reference inner again more inner outer what happens is people have an idea about inner they paid lip service and they go all outer you're just going to be a normal semi-jock, nothing special inner, inner a little bit outer to check inner, [Applause], okay i don't know if i'm clear help, me here help where are we where am i no not where am i where are you guys that was a troll here have a goal there yes does our body our system do all of this whether we're paying attention to it or not if my mind is small, is my energy system still doing its full thing does my soul have a place to live at some degree i mean you're still breathing you're still alive your heart's pumping yeah it kind of functions even if you're an idiot your heart is still beating so within reason yes that's sort of natural normal but we got to pick up the pace you're saying when we tune in that system gets enhanced yes over and over and over period boom yes that's the game and if there's an outer cool thing that's cool but it's inner development where we lose people is they do a little bit of inner get some r say hey, hey and they stay at that level and, try to increase even that level and we've lost them i call it the level of comfortableness in the old days reach a certain level and you say go deeper no, i don't want to go deeper i'm pretty cool here okay uh okay uh i think i'll simply mentioned a certain level rank hard for them to progress because they're damn good out here in the world they've ah and to say let go of that and go inner some more i ain't going to let go of this i've got my club i've got my group people, recognize me i'm going to let go of this because when you let go for a moment there's nothing you're nobody boom and there it is again but a lot of people don't trust the process of the how creation works how to backtrack back to a more original uh they don't trust it what a shame or they trust some people trust it a bit and then they stop others continue they trust it finer, finer and then they stop uh so what keeps people going i don't know an inner calling self saying come on nado you can do better than that come on okay now since i had a draw calling whatever you want to call it he was compelled okay a lot of people don't have that but do the best you can do the best you can and continue and do the best you can and continue okay, if you reach a level and you don't feel like it well at least you'll be better at that level okay like that girl thank you yes yeah thank you yeah um hey okay so brought up tonight one to five that's a good one to file away okay one, pass, and, five, okay oh gina, you got that one now gina you're muted gina i am loving that process we're bouncing off of she was doing some healing work on herself anyway said to slow down there and uh so i called her and said what are you up to and, and she i believe said to me why did one this morning i did one and it's mind-blowing it's just it's i go so deep i just wonder though i don't always remember all the things that happened on all the fives though is it automatically going into my core i mean am i getting better here i feel like it you know what i mean like maybe right now the five maybe when you're in a finer experiencing and then you break from the practice and you come back out to gina land yes, that you don't remember i, don't think that's a shock i don't know if my bobby sometimes sitting out on the porch remembers the niceness of some of the inner work that i do yeah i know cause i don't always remember them all and i'm definitely gone so this five you supposed to remember uh i supposed to remember all that are you supposed to remember you're supposed to experience and carry that experience what i'm trying to say here that carries here and of course during the course of the day you'll get pushed out of probably of course but, the best you can to carry that it's, i could carry the gist of it i mean the final, a little more experience of that experiencing that more the experience of that, should sustain itself for quite a while the awareness of it will fade fast okay yes if you're aware, that you're nice and suddenly i come up to you and say you're not very nice are you, may fall apart because you're just aware and there isn't much sustainability which is the awareness i can break you down real fast i'm good at that i used to call it popping balloons people just had an awareness idea about it, no yeah no yeah okay, but as you experience that has sustainability lasts much, longer and if i say hey idiot you are you speaking to me sir you'll still be nice whatever are you did you follow that yeah, so anyway for so for real important healing inner dimensionally finer inner dimension and the radiations emanations from that level uh the finer level the better the, healing uh potentially is gina in terms of healing um, see, [Applause], don't micromanage yeah we talked about that for a moment micromanage yeah, yes, gina said something funny about she was in a certain way micromanaging and her system said will you shut up okay shut up let us go to work here okay uh where am i going i was going someplace yeah don't itemize things because the finer it gets your finer qualities now instead of using the word energies your finer qualities, are emanating uh so say as a group throughout the whole system, uh, because we don't know where certain illnesses come from uh but when you touch your own more original field of qualities finer and finer more original uh then, whatever is needed for a particular thing, should be affected by this oh god i'm not saying that great am i yeah i'm sorry gina you're muted no i think you're saying it perfectly okay and i like that you're going deeper with the stuff the stuff deeper that's fun isn't it yes it really it's like a whole new i love loving it a whole new world oh my god uh, we think we talked about this a week or so ago uh you did it after we did the calm practice you the next day did courage and you were amazed as you continued and deeper with that the world of courage was like oh my god and there were things there you wouldn't have thought were there and there they were, yeah, and uh susan did the same thing with calmness and she went deeper with it hung out with it and she was amazed at the world could see the universe of calmness it was just mind-blowing uh okay uh okay uh so yeah on the interdimensional ah they're vast worlds on the inner i don't know how to say that well uh and i'd like to keep the vastness of the inner also sort of like that uh kind of right here in this area okay and this i, call it joe size and that the area i can sort of swing a stick around that's about the size uh that i consider to be okay at least for now we'll, we'll see uh you overdo the sides thing oh since it's a probably gonna dissipate and you'll probably go heavier into awareness whoa is that whoa and then you lose [Music] the, activating hereness of it ah god, help somebody say something help me here are we getting anything out of this sir [Applause], sends my new zealand um i think you're putting it over well okay uh who's that from new zealand my friend, mike yes and it was mark or mike okay yeah and kind of mic kicking back to the ruler example that i use with you mike yes, yes, yes, this is kind of a that pattern but even more the pattern was don't do an inch at a time it's not wrong it's not wrong i don't do it inch at a time i, can switch instantly but in terms of a process to let people get to that point was more what oh yeah, and i can slow it down and still do that as a as a way of checking myself yeah fine okay no problem thank you mike teacher help say something say something chinese is he still on i'm here leave us in disgust not at all there he is what's your sense of that sense of it that, that's, you are the core, is you as opposed to oh yeah i got a core over here and i'm aware of a core and whatever that, that, as they can sense themselves as the core through the character through the core self should be clearly, be able to show or be showing yes, indeed so um it comes back a lot to first of all you use language that kind of begins to frame things a little bit and then definitely you have to move into the, way of feeling because these are two kind of separate knowledge systems one is the cognitive and it's very important for us to have good cognitive but the other is this more direct and intuitive um it's not exactly listening but it's a kind of listening it's a it's a it's not a, i am being it's, just being it's just it's feeling so we have to we have to connect with feeling in relationship to, uh to working with these states of, presence, otherwise it's it just becomes like uh [Music], more thoughts and more uh more concepts so feeling moving from thought directly direct experience feeling thank you what i have in my notes was, this two brains thing i think it's being said there's a brain and there's a brain around in the tummy some place yeah it's called the second grain this is science i can brain oh science this is yeah i don't i mean science is not the final arbiter of truth oh dear god no if i waited for science i don't know anything more about this i just remember seeing or hearing or something a brain and a brain i thought not kind of cool what we're trying to do within this scope, is uh is uh have those brains work together so this is the brain of where i come up with a problem or a question or whatever and, and this is the brain that starts to kick back okay, now i just want to get this brain not to hold it to this location per se but to have that, a bigger sense of it here okay yeah, yeah so the uh call it whatever we want to call it we're often referring to it as center which is the which is the english language we use hara and noah talked about the, lower dan tien dan tien is a great word because it means field, of presence or field of elixir yeah a little bit uh alchemical there but it is it's a it's a presence, radiance, that i think one of the one of the great gifts potentially in aikido is that it starts to train or it can train that intuitive and direct knowing sense in a good randori you can't be strategizing if you strategize you're going to get killed figuratively so ah yeah you said something slid by me okay the pulse the, the you know you're i just noticed from the beginning as you started to talk about core you were doing you were doing this action and it's a pulse because everything, uh forgive me but everything breathes no i'm, okay yeah i know and uh everything breathes i had a particular purpose for jumping on somebody who is pushing on that as the only way to go yeah to go yeah enough we're not going to go into that discussion no i'm fine with yeah hey yeah hey i did in my early years a lot of breathing practices it's coming back around again at another whole level yes yeah it's very important the beat the beats of creation being bang, i believe their origin of creation probably was a breathing it breathed out a great idea and the great energies thereof and it's, continuing still going on if i could say one other thing that, really struck me tonight in your in your dialogue um is the is the importance of trusting the universe or trusting that which we can't somehow tangibly wrap our cognitive process around but that, takes a little that takes practice all of this takes some kind of practice and just, coming to it learning how to trust that universe and trust the space uh between the one by two by between trusting the space between the two by and three by when there's uh when it's not yet totally uh gelled into the next level or next yeah if common sense dealing with humans, the heavies of the world uh yeah a lot of them can't even feel i mean you touch them and it makes them fine oh you're touching me i have been for five minutes where have you been so we help them begin to feel and then settle them down a bit and they begin to feel finer feel finer kind of thing so we know in dealing with people we have to go through this process so they can get to sensing and then a finer sensing uh kind of thing yeah indeed but let us not get caught up in the slowness of that uh we don't have the years okay it's, this maneuvering through all of this is much faster not as an idea but faster where the experience can be there also it's, for both of them the awareness idea whatever and the energy that's there at that finer being experienced oh sensei was fast boom and it but it was there wasn't some idea i believe god will save me it wasn't that idea sure it was based on how things work what a beautiful god to make things this way so they just work anyway right thank you ah so um so um yeah expand on your core could we say and whatever form you want to start the game going with uh whether it's uh just getting a juicier, more energized uh getting more energized it's just that's a basic ah you ought to be able to pretty quickly sense feel the more energy of things if i were to do energy, of things if i were to do energy for a moment my hands would start to get warm if i were to do it for a moment my arm won't stop hair which is doing right now it would jump my fingers would come alive i feel like i should conduct a symphony orchestra, or go into ballet or do a great technique where am i going with that um everything is breathing everything is pulsing in that way you know so it's uh you you've often talked about this as qualities of aliveness and i always appreciate that as people think about meditative states as being kind of static or super fine but it's a lot it's even calmness has a great natural vibrancy not an amplitude per se but uh but a clarity and an aliveness so i always appreciate that language when you use it well since i said something here i'm going to call silence you see silence and then aliveness i can't recall exactly but he didn't mention that silence aspect uh i'm trying to think if he added the uh it's quiet, and it beats yeah i don't quite recall so we'll pass on it now was it all criminal life all calm and all alive you've said that before maybe in the lesser form of say martial arts all, calm the martial artist is all calm but in that old calm he's all alive is that a little heavier level of what we're talking about are we are we getting anything out of this uh one to five thank you just to remind you it could be one to ten whatever, you, feel okay try to be distinct i think a couple people mention with the awareness of something and automatically experience part of it in, moving through dimensions of as the curtains open so to speak and there's a finer dimension of course you're more aware of it at first okay real quick real quick yes it looks it looks uh a whiter and brighter whatever okay now the experience of that something from flavor of cleaner and one to five [Applause] yeah there's a purity hovering it's a i hear the word hovering around cleaner, pure, one to five [Applause] just a finer a finer sense i had to forget the word but uh just a finer sense uh like cheese cloth but very nice quality but that sort of openness a better word now if i can't come up with it right now uh okay so just knowing uh, uh, that quite likely you're gonna be aware of it but automatically yes and let me experience it boom, one to five minimum okay have the experience have the experience have the experience when you get a combination of the awareness and the experience and they're more balanced then the potential is to move into the next level okay, so uh a slower form but fast awareness, experience of that awareness and, when they're on sort of equal footing, [Applause] uh who are you good to establish a character and anytime trading it all in for next for next and you'll be aware of next and then you'll automatically go okay i'm experiencing this one to five and you continue you follow that sort of kind of maybe yes sir i make jokes in the dojo sometimes are used to uh where i know i'm a high ranked uh, but, that idea of a high rank which is a fact i got the paper on the wall but on certain days or certain times of the day you're gonna kill me i can't move because, that's not everything that, rank that rank now the experience one to five and as that is experienced now i become a higher rank with capability now i'm ready for whatever okay but you can't do it it's just a paper on the wall just a reminder ah, i'm pooping out anything questions on any dumb stuff i tried to lay out mike again sensei everything you lay out for me makes perfect sense and i'm able to, progress along my path in, parallel with what you're presenting to me and it keeps it keeps the light on the path ahead of me giving me more direction let me jump in very continue, it makes sense to me i know i know i know i'm not talking to you stop i'm just talking makes sense to me good now, the experience of that one to five okay i'm just reiterating i'm not talking to you doc don't be such a soft touch jesus mike yes go ahead you're saying i haven't done the five yet bro um, i would figure out after class i certainly do i do think that's an, excellent um reminder to do the one to five it's getting it with for me for myself i, am genuinely happy with the progress i'm making it and it, follows along the lines that you're teaching, but for me the challenge assuming if i get back into the dojo is trying to get new people to understand that there's, as much insight as there is outside or in fact maybe there's more inside than there is outside it's ah we're going to be talking about the heavies huh well because i, think a fair percentage of the people that come through the door initially are the heavies and it's, it's the tricks of the trade so to speak in, trying to find something that touches them the better you are with you the better level you are the more easily you can read them and know what they can do and can't do and what you should present see that's what the dealers are doing should we bring susan in uh, okay, what, should i do with a heavy patient who's got a screwed up shoulder and she settles and gets to a finer level and she settles and gets to an even finer level and then she reads him from that level and getting great results that totally agree so, don't get caught up in what should i teach them teach them you know you got your basic and you can stick an arm out and i'll teach them whatever if they're sticking an arm out like that uh have them settle and add something and settle and add something come on you got the base you got simple basics you got walk under pressure you got extended arm you got all kinds of weird little come on yeah but be a better level of you to read them better yeah i think it's kind of important yep yeah yep yeah also we don't get caught up into their thickness meaning you don't want to lose the finer of you in trying to help them a certain way and getting caught up in their thickness what do we call them blind leading or blind or something they're blind don't you go blind to try to help them you're on something like that uh the better you are the better you should be able to help, the better you are the better you'll sense things okay, yeah, yep yeah yep yeah roy's always amazing i see roy down there in the corner roy's i was amazed at certain things i say and how they just bubble up and out and stuff roy you there i know you're there yeah show your face yeah, okay, uh, basically it's just being in a bit inner finer and in that case words come out but you've probably seen a lot of cases where uh the, move i'm teaching or something is presented wow help me here is that i can't think of it in particular yeah, it's that all of a sudden it seems that the experience that you're in a story just emerges from this that's perfect for the expression of what's happening there so the whole system is integrated and it just allows itself to speak and it's you know remarkable at times obviously, yeah thank you thank you roy if we don't trust the inner journey uh to help us in the heavier oh yeah see if i'm saying this right we're potentially going to get stuck in the heavier, uh, chipping away with heavier forms of doing things uh i don't know if i said that right but you have to learn to trust the inner is better and what the inner does at that moment live with it you did the best you could by being at that level and if it's not good enough then you go back home and you practice getting deeper so that if a similar situation happens you're going to come at it from a better level something like that joel here that's the artist part of martial artists okay people we're running out time here sensei this is andrew from san jose how are you doing great drug treat um what we've been talking about for the past um 30 minutes it reminded me of a quote by bruce lee and i ran to go look at it do you mind if i read it to you or if it's short fast go it's just it's approaching eight o'clock is all okay um, not being tense but ready not thinking yet not dreaming not being set but flexible it is being holy and quietly alive aware and alert ready for whatever make may come yeah some cool statements yeah that's a certain level okay if you don't do the inner work you're gonna make up stories about that, and you're gonna try to do it and never really be quite right it's an inner development that manifests out that way okay uh bruce like i don't know what degree inner work trusted inner work and the inner work uh what help make the bruce lee that you like who says those kinds of things yeah so yeah thank you andrew yeah people, finney, you all have a good holiday uh let's see if you can do anything with this instead of a core here it's a larger, sense and, that's not something you're doing that's, you that's an experience you okay, so let's see if we can shift the sense of core from that early form which is okay to start with by the way you need to warm up and get things going sure, fine uh but let's, see if you get anything out of this larger uh, uh sense of it and being it i'm finished thank you so much sensei and happy holidays to everybody and stay safe we will have no class next week friday christmas eve in, california we'll have no class on january 31st new year's eve we'll next be online with nado sensei on friday january 7th in the new year cincy, uh just a reminder i've been noticing out here i'm at a stop sign it's red it turns green and the car comes from the you know having gone through a red and i'm seeing a lot of this going on so when your green light when your light turns green if they're anything like the people around here, don't be too quick wait a while sure as somebody's gonna come through i'm just seeing this really being overdone, dangerous in fact anyway just be careful out there so, drive safely and drive safely and happy holidays to everyone have a great break lauren you too mike take it easy joel jack i'll see you tomorrow and we're over and out good night

## Aikido, Easy the I, Robert Nadeau, Aikido 8th Dan,  2022-01-07

**Date:** 2022-01-07

good evening and again and again to reiterate what kenny said i hope you had a good safe holiday okay easy the eye we have a character you are a character or robert whatever level i'm at character okay there is an eye in around here someplace and i self eventually will start with the word i uh so since i said one problem at this first level here is the uh i and the character are so tightly hooked in can't tell one from the other people just don't have a sense of who's who here, okay, now following that easy settle to our basics and look at it play with it like there's two things here there's the eye that's kind of a free agent as it as it disconnects disengages from the character, okay, easy the eye in first disengaging from the character where, the eye begins to for like a words experience itself as a freer agent okay, as we continue, eventually uh the eye as it gets freer and freer aware of itself experiencing itself as an eye might change its name and say i prefer self, eventually it may change its name as we continue through finer dimensions uh where it'll be a i'm a more original eye or i'm a purer eye i self i self will come in so uh and whatever words that it itself wants to name itself so but we'll use i then eventually i self uh is that okay are we okay so far now, back in the island just to reminisce a bit back in the eslin days i used to use a word with feeling and i'd say easy, easy, and i would use that word a lot with that tonality if i remember easy, easy, and what began to happen a year later two years later people come back for uh, to do my workshop again, and, and, they'd say wow that easy was like magical i'm like really because i wasn't presenting it at that time that i was aware of as a magic word but i heard it and somebody else said and somebody else said i said oh okay something's going on here i think they're easy and they're getting a freer eye heading towards the finer self and when you do that you reach a finer dimension so it's another way of going from a uh a one by to a two by or from a bobby to a robert uh or from a uh what's, our other one uh, we have a another one that we use bobby roberts, uh, okay, huh and anyway that this is just a dimensional change 10 pounder to a 20 pounder okay now instead of trying to drag this heavier bobby threw a dimensional barrier into a finer dimension so he's coming at it as a 10 pounder he's trying to be a 20 pounder, he's trying to be a 20 pounder so it could be a lot of conflict there okay start i don't know fighting yourself your 10 pounders fighting the 20 pounder okay or you're uh one by is getting confused by the beginning presence of a two-by, okay you've sort of following me sir okay, easy the eye easy the eye as a separate unit from the body it's a freer unit okay it's not it's not stymied or really stopped by dimensional walls where the physical body might, be stopped a bit you know the 10 pounder trying to be at 20 and his obstructions there so any sense easy to play with it for a moment there's a body we establish the body bobby establish him and here also here also is an eye easy the eye i easy, it's disengaging it's a freer unit easy the eye okay for example my set right now my senses is easy the eye is passing through the body it's more like around here past the body you see the eye just a little flavor there's a little more room here he should be now ah, with that little playing around anybody get anything with that easy the eye any, basics first to start us off help well it felt um it felt relaxing no tensions from earlier in the day no problems about anything that's going on i recognize myself but i'm in a comfortable place there something different okay now uh, let's not go upwards in easy the uneasy that easy the eye uh i don't want you to miss the fuller experiences that we'll get into so into so you could do it that way but you're into the awareness of easy the eye it's more emphasis on awareness only easy so we do it here don't go anywhere it's here and if you do the sort of the under so easy the eyes settle open we're sort of heading this way and that will include the awareness part but your ex have the ability to experience okay so this direction if you would as opposed to just that direction okay, this direction here i'm deeper but i'm here, i am deeper so that direction is that okay now again those two are really tied in tight together so in your earlier practices um, don't mind that it takes a little time of a few minutes let's say minimum easy one more shot on that settling you got a body in the world he's in okay, but there's also another piece here the eye okay the eye is a different piece than this easy the eye easy means disengaging yes the body is still there yes the yes the body is still there yes the problems are still there easy the eye easy the eye [Music] this, freer unit of a bit deeper easy, into a more what open space flavor you see the eye and it'll be at first probably little things you'd want to do like is the body's still here let me check because i, lost it for a moment oh yeah still here, after all don't, bother i remember back kenny mentioned something about uh the problems of the day i think he said uh weren't there i remember in my early years, uh, it came to me when he was talking that uh one thing caught my attention as i was sitting meditating one day was uh i was in this ex having this experience where the worries of the day didn't exist and that like wow they don't exist are, they gone because i meditated did those problems disappear and then when i was finishing the meditation i realized the problems were still there but they weren't there when i was meditating because i was probably in easy the eye level or pattern you see the eye okay and again anybody getting any, sense what's your experience of an eye disengaging is that an okay word disengaging from the character body bobby you see the eye your sense of an eye that's getting easier that's disengaging talk to me your sense your sense i know it's early but you're sense sensei chris here from new zealand the um experience of sort of well i'm not too sure it's correct sort of moving into from my body into my body's field sort of it's sort of lift but it's an uh still, connected to a sort of an outer, body so it's sort of drifting through the levels and it's, expensive but not too far it's free i'm not too sure it feels the correct words my body's field so i've shifted from, an awareness of my body to an awareness of my uh a field around my body okay, where i say more open space she's calling that a field around okay it's different, okay so out of the heavy body [Applause], starting to move dimensionally going a bit dimensionally and you know there's a field around okay and again let's not get caught up in the field it's okay but to continue, and continuing you see the eye easy the eye yes there's a field so noted now easy the eye easy the eye a sense of lighter for me a sense of a sense of floating some kind of freeness floating, some kind of freeness floating, floating that word comes easy floating easy the eye somebody talk to me you see it's your sense of eye that's getting freer that's disengaging your sense talk to me yeah, there's joy there's like happiness joy like a little sense of love that's beginning to come through okay at a certain level uh, for some people she's moved along maybe a little faster than some of you others remember people are going to be start at different levels and, and so don't so don't, use them as a gauge on how you're doing you're starting with, where you're at your next level uh your next levels and it's moving through uh so just keep track of your home you can note what other people are saying uh so a certain level of freedom and starts to pick up the uh what are we calling that uh, uh qualities, of, joy and some little flavors of niceness lovingness something in there okay, i would call those a finer dimension of energy finer dimensions of energy, finer dimensions of energy will begin to show as qualities okay energy finer levels oh they're qualities finer, levels oh they're qualities finer levels, eventually you can call them commie does that make you happy call me okay, but sort of go through the levels a bit or have some practice with the levels don't just throw out words ahead of time okay i sort of go if you throw tommy it's a nice word you learn stop it hang out the energies for a bit till they're more balanced hang out with the balance energies till they show qualities hang out with the quality so they show finer, qualities and on and on and on is that okay, somebody else there was a sense of um like a blank page of potential and openness receptivity that sort of quiet of having space to space to listen space to receive so in that quiet space a self is getting freer and should we say experiencing the quiet is aware of experiencing the quiet space yeah yes instead of filling it with chatter yeah that's part of our disengaging if there's a bunch of chatter then i, think you're still caught up in your linda world who chatters right i like what you say when you say um there's a balancing of the energies and for me it's like a sense of synchronizing of the senses so like instead of being caught up in my, thinking or my seeing or my hearing they all the sense fields sort of like are, balanced and they're almost merging like i'm, sense feeling red or, smelling red but i don't need to see it, it's the it's their, the sense fields are, more harmonious they're just not, getting bogged down in the nitty-gritty and the harmony level or the balance level is uh is uh nice to note because we're going to add something here after a bit uh, because, what we're saying here is if, you catch on a little clearer with the eye is a free agent and can pass through dimensional very fast to drag a 10 pound into a 20 pound space i'm probably pretty good at it i'm not sure my history on doing that i probably have done that a lot probably even taught it a lot uh but this easy the eye can pass through much easier faster through dimensionality did i say that okay the dimensional walls we call them membranes uh they're not really there for the free eye high self you can pass through dimensions really easy with this free eye easy the eyes the free self can really move okay all right now, let's say you're finished with your session, uh before you get up at that level you're at that level of balance, okay that level of uh harmony however you're experiencing it, one, fun trick there is to an, important piece uh, who is the character and at that level you're at you're at you let it naturally reassemble a character so instead of bobby trying to become a robber i just easy through to a better level and at a better level hey and, and, and, there's a robber much easier faster potential i don't know if you follow that well did i say that well help noah give me a thumbs up if you're okay with that there he is okay you okay with that bob okay he's my critiquer no thumbs up i have to continue so where the hell are you i have a question about that um this is amy um so when you are in that space in your hate and you're creating a new character okay yeah so you have to have a new character can you just come up and cut wood you better have a character okay, but can you bring that easy the eye back also, if that's if that's can you bring it back to this hate to this character can that be a character yeah, yeah, yeah, keep meditating ecbi but if you got to stand up and maneuver around it'd be nice to have a character okay, makes a lot of sense to stand up and move around no, right no i get it thank you yeah a character is not well known in the meditation circles okay well since they thought it was damn important and it goes on and on and on we could say uh uyoshiba vaikido which is a big statement big level that's a character jesus return retain his as jesus the christ, a character so you so you all along the way this bobby robert nado doesn't stop at nado it's finer and finer and finer okay it's a very important piece that a lot of the awareness types don't catch, they float around and it's nice and easy and loosey-goosey and they don't kind of catch this part not saying it well maybe but live with it we'll come around another day okay easy the eye easing the eye i think also amy that uh as, your you practice a bit your clarity between ease of the eye and a character uh then later it's easier we're not so wrapped up after a bit we can go hey easy the eye ah there he is easy the eye ah there he is easy the eye easy there he's already doing his thing it's uh it's not a new concept after a while it's like something you kind of know is going on no it's the sense of it going on is going on damn words yeah i think sometimes i, get to that point where it's so relaxing or it's, such a nice space and i want to bring that space into the real world but it's hard to do that you can't do that that's where we need a character you want to go back into the world we need a character now the game is to be at a better dimensional level to establish the character and that's the character that hopefully is present in the world and with practice you can that character will sustain for quite a while it was just an awareness about it uh it'll fade fast but the actual like the character having its own experience as a character at that level that level uh he she can sustain himself herself uh for quite a while it it'll get bumped along the way and we just quickly go back to it or since they did real fast real fast so it does get faster and easier we're just working through that uh the first pieces of it so is that where you would say the recognize yourself when you when you used to say or you say now i don't know like recognizing yourself is that recognizing the character so that you can maybe go back to it later or call it back later if you need it yeah you're bringing up an older term and i'm trying to remember how and when i use that term so i think i'll stay away from that one because i can't quite remember, when i presented that or what i had in mind i presented that ah yeah probably a good question but i'm not quite there amy okay uh so, uh, so, uh dragging dimensionally a 10 pounder into 20 pounds into 30 pounds you can do it but it drags it drags and probably a lot of little obstructions that happen uh you, easy the eye and it can pervade those dimensions and then any time you get a level of balance, your sense of balance you can have that balance place be the place where the system will remix i don't have to verb a mix the system naturally makes this naturally makes it so i don't turn it into a verb okay amy check that you just the way you said it may have sounded like a verb i don't know if it was you check but don't turn it into work at a certain level because the energies are all there hey and they're filling in the character filling in the character and again with practice that'll get faster and faster uh, so let's practice take our time enjoy the process yeah okay this is the eye easy the eye settling opening because we want to make sure we include the lower again easy okay let's say you're moving along let's go back to ecbi it's getting freer it's disengaging you're moving through some dimensions you see the eye some people mentioned some of the dimensional stuff florida amy said uh not loving uh joyful, sense uh new zealand said oh it's kind of field like whatever field was to him okay all of you finer dimension easy what's the what should i call it what's the terrain for you the those energies may be showing us qualities, for you what's the quality that are there i'm getting a lot of peace peacefulness and the word calmness for me peaceful it's okay to do nothing you're just a peaceful calm place peaceful is the sense of the energy somebody playing that little angle on it what's your sense of the energies hopefully using a quality word if you're so experiencing tom for example this might be the place where it begins to feel like fall you remember, home certain energy level of balance which you all pick up your own way what ways are you picking up a certain level of dimensional balance easy the eye change and the dimension here i stick up a very pleasant, hum in my body i, feel like everything sort of has this nice little resonance okay five vibrations well i would use your word space okay let's see space uh maybe, uh, yes space but is there a, quality in the space or a spatial quality and well the emptiness or the, space it just feel oh i guess i would say the potential of anything because there's enough space for, movement or change or growth uh i have a question if that's okay um does the eye go, get absorbed by the characters or is the character kind of how do they come together jesus i don't know dusty give me a moment here how were you born you maybe go back to your birth and work it out because at birth time was creating hate you were there if not then you were hovering around and then you decided to kick in and then this body started to grow but it was something happened at click time so if you want to go over your pre-birth a few minutes and your actual uh figure it out but i'm gonna spiral in does it float through, maybe somebody knows at the moment i don't know and you anybody wanna noah you got an answer on that one you want to go for that one that's i would say what the eye isn't absorbed the eye contributes something to the character by its full and complete presence at that level yeah but i think that's exactly how it came in i think yeah well it, felt like as we were doing that easy eye like the eye was, breaking apart and going to different did my different characters or my different, uh parts uh parts so i don't know if i was getting confused or not again maybe from how i'm trying to lay it out a little confusing for me you got different characters and when i'm breaking apart i'm, getting confused so can we just stay with dusty, you're dusty now at a different level maybe it's mr dusty, yeah, maybe it's the great dusty uh but don't bounce around too much uh, just, just, keep it simple for us dumb people me and you included here kiss keep it simple that before birth feels like there's an air a gust thank you oh god anyway uh now we've, touched on this before let me see all right uh can you see if i stand no i have to change, okay yeah there we go uh we've touch on this oops i can see it here we've touched on this before standing, we're going to lift the arm on okay all right and, uh making glee on a little heavier bobby, lifting okay, i lifted my arm and this little tension in the shoulders okay, then, historically i infer easy, the eye which encourages freer movement disengaging into a better level potentially and at that level the arm okay not necessarily a beautiful movement but there was no tension in the shoulder like my first one, okay, it's not unusual to not pick up that much of a change from the one to the two but by time we get the third one should we really begin to notice easy you see the eye easy it's disengaging it's a little freer and in that this one moved up for me a little more of long distinct and a touch of float to it a touch of float i could feel a couple little muscles grab but there was a fair amount of float also float also that's kind of fun i like to do one more easy, easy, disengage from that character, last lifter easy whatever level i'm at, that level now this one's starting to for me get potentially beautiful oh gracious, that's mine what's yours okay so in doing arm raises uh, can you click me try oh they can't see me anyway okay in doing arm raises we're just uh trying to, show you show you how, close dimensional levels are here we brought out the easy the eye a bit more but we did basically the same thing okay so far [Music] another one we've done historically is uh just ah okay, everybody, oh easy, easy the eye freer open set link into the eye itself it's freer it's freer whatever level we're at and note the vibration sound of your voice, okay yeah right easy, easy the eye in first brings us to a finer level easy the eye it's a fast mover easy at whatever level we're at it's from that level god i love making sounds i love uh and different things you notice with the different sounds that the last one came from deeper and more through my body as opposed to something i was doing it wasn't me verbing it like it came through hey and it came through more uh, as if soon it's gonna be like who made that sound i didn't make that sound it just sort of happened kind of thing that'll happen after a while so easy the eye to get to a better level quickly, and at that better level a sound okay right a reminder of past things but just highlighting the easy the eye part of it okay, uh i was going to do a past thing where we said what quality comes to you very easily but we may have touched it on the earlier one where i said what, quality are you getting uh as the energy dimensions show uh after a bit finer energies will show as qualities okay and we all have our own little preferences they're natural in your system you got your color scheme i got my color scheme those are qualities okay and what's another one um hang on a sec i'm dense tonight ah oh gotcha can i bore you okay aikido i hope i can move ah okay well first one okay my first level was um little hair worried and i had to keep my eye on it easy the eye easy and it moves quickly to another dimension and from that dimension i like that would you like to draw i'm not on the track i mean there's just no nobody out there anymore like okay you go there okay so there's a natural draw right okay easy i'm just easy the eye with the sense of finer dimension for some reason it changed moves wasn't my, intention to change moves it just happened and i live with happenings easy, easy the eye ah find your dimension comment on that one there was something different there flavor was different, there flavor was different there was more i think the emphasis on, the on the second part the other one had another okay so thank you country so one two easy so maybe we're trying to show tonight that easy the eye is a fast way of moving through, dimensions okay uh but we need some practice at the first few uh to get the tricks of the trade sense of it uh, but eventually, not tomorrow eventually, the easy the eye you see the self easy the truer self can go through many, dimensions to a very, what to call it superior level finer dimensional very, very fine dimensional level is there for us okay, uh but don't mind practicing with the 10 to the 20 pounder the bobby the robert the one by one or to a two by two or don't mind practicing and, getting uh i don't know tricks of the trade uh knowing what's interfering and not, utilizing interfering things you don't need them kind of thing where the hell am i somebody bob could you or speak to any possible relationship between easy the eye and the concept of downtime that, whole aspect of letting go yeah there is oh let me see if i'm there that when we down time let go uh there's a yeah there's a lot of easy the eye going on there is that what you're saying i guess i, was sort of saying is you know are we kind of talking about the same thing from a different approach or is there something more specific to say downtime or easy the eye that we should be paying attention to i don't know uh yeah i think we could sometimes tie them all together a certain way but i also like presenting this i, as its own piece and how big time that is because that goes all the way back to the to the beginnings of creation really way back to the finest most original as its own peace self soul self a continuation of the eye is going to eventually be soul self at the beginning or even pre-creation you're getting past my pay grade right there but appreciation uh but yeah they are related to that let go of everything down time uh, easy uh easy uh whatever, so is that, what we're talking about yeah i think i think that's, my that was my question it's, i appreciate that yeah uh, yeah in fact when i was mulling on doing this doing this session uh that popped into my mind that uh we should uh fit that in with those i just didn't have the, time or the clarity tonight to do it but yeah, yeah but it's a nice piece to catch what it really is uh you know, i guess i'm, coming back to your story about the people who are so excited about easy and this thing we keep coming back to that you know really there there's a pretty simple fundamental and if you do it then it does everything else if you do it then things naturally happen, yes, it might work down while you're all on next friday because of a technical problem, uh we're not gonna have a session okay, sorry we just had a vacation and now we're taking one more off uh anyway next friday, no session okay but here's what you can do if you wanna just jot a line doesn't have to be a page or even a paragraph nothing like that just what subjects would you like to talk about uh and if you want to uh you just say the subject or you could add a little tiny bit if you want i don't want you to have to write a big thing uh but something you want to get go around with again um [Music], or for more clarity hopefully uh, send them to lauren okay all right all right all right uh tj i was talking to you about this session you're on i'm here sensei anything you want to jump in on right, now we had a yeah i first of all i want to appreciate the depth that you're bringing to this, uh teaching that you've done over the years of easy the eye so we're seeing i'm seeing experiencing the uh kind of an expanded viewpoint of easy the eye as, as the space and the spaciousness that's important in letting go of a sense of identity and we've talked about that, as a as a as a as a 10 pounder 10 pounder uh you know or trying to drag into a 20 pound space or one by two by 3 by so the spaciousness that i think moon mentioned as well and maybe others i think is really important because in order to mix up the new character you have to have the space and you can't be taking the luggage, of the of the previous sense of identity so the easy the eye is really important um as a way of moving through the fields uh or the potentials i think moon used the term potential which i really like uh that is possible in the in the mix up of the new character so ease of the eye even though we've heard that and worked with that in various ways i'm appreciating how you're framing it tonight, um as a uh a greater potential as a letting go yeah, yeah, let me jump in yeah that's sort of what i wanted to get across that we've used it before in very simple ways using the eye now look at your arm move better easy, look at your cotton issue was better wow we presented it in [Music], lesser levels so to speak you know we're on track but, but tonight i'd like to get across the wow of the continuation of easy bi and as it continues it may change its name about itself and say self may change its name and say oh i'm their more original self it may change its name and say uh whatever, one word will come up maybe eventually is the transparency of self yes pull that off uh, uh that this is really big time it's a it's an important piece itself, okay, in some ways it's also uh the dimension or the mix-up that you the mix the new mix of the character is also very, uh it can be very intuitive when you were showing in aikido working with kacha what showed up for you, weren't cognating that you weren't strategizing that you were open to the space of what was uh in moon's word uh potential there so that's always interesting and it's uh one of the exciting aspects of coming into harmony with the with the universe here, yeah oh i think in many most of the times a lot of the time all the time oh essentially i didn't know what technique was going to happen yeah you know i was teaching this technique thing to do that but uh it would be like whatever something's gonna happen he just didn't interfere with the happening, so we named it takimusu you know and uh yeah that was that was a beautiful expression and you've often said that real aikido may show up different than anything you've ever, done with the formal techniques yeah, yeah, for me yeah that's another discussion uh, yeah and to not get locked up in formal technique, we do it this way robotville jesus people unfortunately the robots get stronger what a shame if they didn't our work would be very easy, but they do get a bit better and you say go inner and say why i'm just getting strong, dumber but i'm getting strong oh my god the human condition indeed, indeed, anything t-shirt yeah so yeah with this i mean we're i think one of the one of the interesting phrases you used to use to use in this was don't train for stupid it's kind of uh a little course but in this in the same way as we let go we're opening to that spacious potential and you have to get comfortable that's why i think you're encouraging us to practice with this you got to get comfortable with the spaciousness you can't, keep a dime on the uh on the phone booth uh that's an old uh reference but you know yeah or you can practice in the at first earlier to get comfortable in a semi-controlled way your space is big you're not sure what to do uh, check for some, form of harmony or balance whatever might show with that and with that with that then, who's the character well maybe another click open but a character will be mixed there because your qualities are there, because your qualities are there you're in your own world here your own universe whatever you want to call it and all your stuff is, here it's a matter of opening to it uh this guy is not very open to the more of himself but this is himself all those dimensions, within those finer dimensions it's just more of you yeah so a finer level of uh easy the eye your qualities will show pure and makes pure, uh stuff like, that so uh don't go anywhere it's you you're, right here you're right here you're right here uh just dimensionally we'll move but we're not going anywhere yeah right here one last thing uh sensei as, amy was uh i was interested in amy's inquiry two amy's oh amy shipley okay yeah and uh yeah hi amy you were talking uh about the, what to do in that space but in, that space the space itself is an important aspect of the transformation from a one however we're gonna frame that from a one by two a two by, by robert nado sensei that whole lineage of, of uh of movement uh that uh that in the language that we've used or you've used sensei it's the, 10 pounder to the 20 but whatever allegory we use in there it's a it's an evolution that's directly connected with, with my lineage with amy's lineage with your lineage as you were talking about the colors and the spectrum that's another way of framing that so it's not going to be inconsistent what arises in a carrot in the next character won't be like this is weird i never thought of this you know it's gonna there's gonna be some tie-in even though you're not dragging the, the previous character uh into the new space i, think both though uh, with finer levels of character showing one you might be surprised because he's so much more capable let's say you're a bobby going to an auto or something you might be surprised because of its tape capabilities yeah okay but they'll also be that sense of oh it's capable in a way that even bobby is sort of interested or familiar with is that so kind of both yeah i think i, think we're talking about a sense of lineage but it's not that it's not totally foreign but it's it'll be new dimensions might be totally new, uh in other words the one buy can't really even imagine a three buy oh yeah, no, uh there's a potential i remember my early days uh some sense of uh a finer level of me uh would scare the lesser me yeah uh it'd be like well we're gonna say the finer levels we're gonna have a lot of responsibility and the lesser said i can't cope with more responsibility i can't even get by my life now you know but it's like i'm sorry bobby you heard that it wasn't meant for you to hear it he's not talking to you he's talking about himself yes it's too beautiful for sure i was wondering about this too because i posted it in the chat too maybe it doesn't make a lot of sense but the you've created a character you're in that character space but the situation can, instantly change so that, easy the eye is always it's like your right hand gal guy whatever it's like you're it's there with you all the time is that right i mean because you could get slammed to the ground or you could like do something different right the situation is different and it requires a different, and it requires a different maybe character every time that's why that's why sensei said it can happen very quickly yeah when you're when you're in that space the transformation to the next character can be yeah really fast and, in those senses levels feet i'm trying to remember i was just going over that the other day uh the situation changes the character they're a, instant relationship between situation circle centered character there's a relationship a dialogue a beat uh situation changes boom this which i think is what you're talking about yeah just but that easy the eye has to be there like it just it's inherent well you have to get to a level, to actually experience that level of that circle responding to the center and the center responding back at this level i'm talking about i'm not talking about uh bobby level right it'll work better but it won't be a fantastic level let's say oh sensei's level is a fantastic level, is a fantastic level uh, to get to that level i think we have to backtrack, of the eye ease of the eye easy the eye and see the lay of the land and how it works and, and uh the characters that are there for example and just how it works and to be, part of how it works i think i'm trying to say to say yeah but i believe a sensei i said that because i was just researching that the other day uh that when this changed when the situation changed being banned this is changing, yeah, uh so we can i like what i like what amy is saying also this is tom sensei i like what amy is saying uh retaining this um easy to eye in terms of trading in uh, in other words i'm you know with this spatial quality it allows me to be able to trade in a character, um, and, the space is part of that the easy the eye is the vehicle yeah that allows that training in to happen yeah because eventually that is going to have to happen there's just no question about it and after a bit just to try to eventually speed things up let's be careful even of words like, my words trade it in i don't want to get caught in the slowness of oh god i gotta trade bobby in because this attacker is coming at me and i can't cope i gotta trade him in i don't want to get stuck in that slow this there i'm dead he's gonna kill me all right yeah so uh so one thing about this is i'm trying to get across the eventual speed and effortlessness with this free eye, how freely it can pass through dimensions, and in finer dimension bing how fast new mixes happen so uh that's why i'm saying amy be careful of how you word that it your sense may be fine but i've seen a lot of people say oh now i gotta mix up a character while this attacker is all over me i'm trying to mix up a character it's like boom, it mixes it mixes now again we can in practice take our time and make sure we're fuller feeling the character and stuff like that but not to get caught up in the time, or no eventually that's not there anymore i'm just doing it slowly to make sure i'm full and stuff later it is full kind of thing i hadn't i hadn't this is amy from florida i had an experience with you when i was 28 years old and just amy yeah i don't know if they're ready for your and my experiences what's it what's it we have to make sure are no children watching tonight this is this is this is for everyone um but it was we used to go to the doggy diner after class yes i had just started aikido and i was 28 years old and i guess i wanted to be cute or smart ass or something like that you know my new york came out and i said something to you that was just i meant it like a tease or a smartass or and but it came out like, a verbal attack and what i saw which blew my mind was your energy body got off the line your physical body was there your energy body got off the line and, what you said to me how you uh dealt with you know the conversation we then had was just peaceful like it just went on as if nothing happened, there was no there was no uh the situation did not affect you, just got off the line of it yeah i, just would be off the line because i want people to be in the here and now kind of stuff so i want them to go over there to do this process work uh so get off the line probably more like change from the heavy normal now though whoever he is to boom yeah that's what happened it was that boom it just happened boom it was it was beautiful it was beautiful sometimes the magic works yes elaine here um can you hear me okay um, where, where i find this to really be um, uh important or even pragmatic in a way in my life and work with my clients and uh pruning in my garden um which i love um, the, the, really potent moments when you're engaged like if i'm involved in a session and, um, there are these pauses, of you know just pausing in the experience of being with this person in a session and that's that opportunity for, a level change uh a fuller answer of what the situation is asking for this is just a great um, [Music], description of that process that i feel i experience and um, i mean where i love it with pruning is you know you, can just um, you can just be with a tree and, find the shape it likes um [Music], it tells you what to cut it tells you what to cut it tells you what it wants and, that can change in the process of being with it, might not be what i plan initially it might change and i won't catch that change unless i'm in this process yeah that's a lighter way of describing it with a client it's a really it's a much deeper process because there's so much going on in the situation you know that you were involved in how i am and all of those things me interject for a moment uh i like the word pause with the sense of downtime i know you're using it that it fits in with the ease of the eye pattern uh but back to what moon was saying uh, about their they're very similar so a pause, is a down time which brings us potentially to another level if you know what you're doing and that better level responds better sees the tree better or what whatever uh so, yeah so the patterns of uh again forget the words tonight but down time trading in uh letting go and the and the uh easy the eye and what that really means yes there there's a strong relationship there i don't know what a word it will tonight but a strong relationship uh but again i wanted to bring out uh, the importance of the i the importance of the i self, eventual soul self uh that's big time and i didn't want it to be sort of oh that's just a, pause that's just a letting go it's nothing much kind of thing just want to sort of get away from that sense of it and, promote uh, uh it's a beautiful piece and how it works is beautiful and as we as we experience it more and the effortlessness in which it can move through dimensions and what happens from finer dimensions that's wow that's wow so that's all i was trying to say uh and not sure tonight how to say that about, a down time or trading in or pause or all those other words uh yes, yes and let's keep in mind easy the eye i self i truer self essential eyes soul self it's we got a ways to go yet it's a fun go, go around go around anyway bye-bye thank you yeah thanks thank you bob you know you know you've used easy the eye for ever i mean i've, known you for a long time and you've used it for a long time and i, always was just like something to help me click um, you know and to open into a wider space but what you're doing tonight is, really creating a true experience that, that allows you to move into something more, rather than just a phrase that, helps you make a transition let me jump in yes uh this is a problem people learn a phrase easy the eye and maybe in using that phrase maybe they do a little bit of easy the eye and they get a little something better and they say oh i got it that's great what we're saying here is on and on and on and it's a beautiful trip yeah and an important trip the trip we eventually have to make people uh, yes go ahead sorry well no that's, essentially it's just you, know it's, it's like you've created a doorway rather than a it's just being afraid a, technique or a help helper to, to open more this is like a doorway to something, it is a doorway can i ask a question is that anything um okay so yeah we're you know it's elaine again oh sorry yeah maybe okay so this is in the stupid question category what is the common denominator when you're thinking about how you know you don't want to just trade in you're not just letting go um, what do you see as that uh basis or a common denominator is it just a uh an experience of the universe um [Music], what is what is the continuity what continues through all of that stupid question but yes uh i'm gonna need help uh, what's the common denominator one if i if i'm hearing you uh to get to a finer dimension where we're a better level of ourselves and a better level of self functions better so you're better in the world potentially hopefully uh you're a better tree cutter from a better dimension of you level of you, uh, help me here elaine help well, okay so okay so i don't know maybe this just elaine may i yeah no, because i there's a piece in here that i think what if i heard you right in the same resonance of where, we started with this there's some fundamental thing that you're trying to describe that you're, trying to describe that you're teaching us through this one approach that you've taught us through maybe several, that fundamentally opens up into this dimensional process where then you know what to do with your clients and so on and so forth and i want to go back bob the story you tell about oh sensei uh coming out on the mat and then stopping and, you know breaking away from doing the quote unquote's technical training and going over and doing whatever you would call his process and coming back and the fact what i'm trying to say is like then he would come back and he would have his techniques a musician would have his scales or whatever would, have his scales or whatever would have but something took place in that and i'm guessing that was pretty close to easy the eye or some way of talking about it that, resonates with that yeah, that's the period the name of the game kind of thing, yeah, to move into a better level of yourself boom, and things happen so at a better level you potentially play better music at a better level you cut the tree better according to how it wants to look and whatever uh at a better level you treat your client patient better do better work they'll pass the word on to their friends and neighbors you do great work uh, so we have that plus along the way that we should uh be potentially functioning a bit better as a sign that we're doing this work the goal is much more than that um, so i'm not going to get stopped because i, i get to a level where i got a job and i'm making 500 000 a year uh wouldn't stop me i'm not talking about everyone wouldn't stop me from continuing this inner, quest this inner development this inner searching, for the more and more original of things thank you richard people we're eating up time anything easy the fundamental practice that whatever it is that you're describing here it's just um i kind of feel like, i guess the resonance between the way you've taught it through downtime and the way you're talking about it tonight, that somewhere it we start to recognize uh, i don't actually i don't even think i want to go there just the process is big the simple process is much bigger than it looks yeah i think so yeah i was even going to say something like a, a, teacher you can jump in on this one here that basically meditation is just basically easied the eye well in fact it is it is it is and you do need to let go and par and part of that initially is there some sense of uh of calmness but it's that's not the that's not the destination that just becomes the part of the texture along the way there are different vibrational levels they'll be joyful they'll be calmness they'll be uh really, caring uh love and honor and honor yes, yes, yes but those are vibrational levels and you must continue also through those and you must be a character at different levels who are you at this level be a character function yeah in order to in order to open up to any kind of genuine uh insight about the nature of self or the nature of the universe you can't be dragging your initial sense of self-identity into that otherwise that's like the beginning of this class i said it right if people heard it yeah that there's just confusion in here and just to start with ah this is this and that is that or vice versa that's that this is this and as this and that are get clearer to you which was experientially get clearer to you this can be very fast and very easy, and we don't have to clutter it up with too much stuff there's no, reason to well the key word that you used i think is experientially that it's that it is in fact a direct uh experience and not a projection or an imagination and that's why i've got my little red balloon up here uh let's see i'm well versed in this red balloon that's how i started meditating thank god i had a good connection with the body because i didn't but it was upper aware i was doing basic meditation masculine style god the father kind of thing and i say i was good at it i was i was natural bing b i got in some beautiful spaces, yeah, you know my question was before i went to japan it's true here in my sittings it's true i knew there was a trickle down i don't recall the details of a trickle down but i knew there was a trickle down but my question when i went to japan was is it real here, in the world here yeah and i saw sensei and i said oh it is now how do i how do i catch on to, that that's why i keep emphasizing the experience of it not just the awareness of it that's why i push on that uh well your question has opened up a whole new world for all of us that have studied with you over these years and that was uh that's an essential question that many even the advanced teachers didn't ask didn't ask i have to say you know so appreciate it yeah, and say does that mean advanced teachers yeah i don't know they got rank i think you know or something like that uh i vote for the example as the common denominator that elaine was asking for and, in agreement with what tj is saying, it the common denominator is the experience it's not the idea of it's not the idea it's the experience that is the common denominator the i wants to make the itself and the idea the common denominator but that's not it yeah, experience and, uh it's all here to experience, yeah, yeah, okay sure yeah dimensionally here yeah dimensioning here yeah, well since they said don't go anywhere it's here but some of the things when you're heavy you got to figure out like he said i think he's talking about the universe he said now you put that in your body and it was like how can i put that big fan i, mumbled around with that for more than a week i'll tell you the universe in your body the universe in your body the universe and your body then it got kind of crowded i couldn't quite fit it in that way but this inner space and you realize it is the universe and it is inner finer dimensional so it is in your body so that made sense but to first hear that and to try that like that was weird put the universe in your body ah you want me katja no it's time people enjoy a free friday sorry uh but enjoy and do drop me a line if it's something you want to talk about you know you know so you can jot anything from a word to a sentence you don't have to do big stuff i'm not asking for a lot of work i just uh, keep things going uh thank you for tonight uh moon thank you uh elaine tja thank you thank you all, you people all the amy's in the world thank you bob if we were in town i'd take you out to dinner good class thank you

oh foreign [Music], [Applause], [Music] foreign [Music] and good evening everyone I think we're just about ready and uh and uh I thank Richard Noone for providing the beautiful shakohachi music tonight welcome back Lauren and uh I think sensei's uh just about ready and so uh here we go good evening sensei hey good evening okay uh this could be an important class I'm glad, you're all showing up uh so we're looking at uh what was the right up right up positive approach to Darling uh I was also uh looking at navigating the dark be comfortable with the dark so in that area uh We've brought up dark before uh any clarification on the early part uh but I would like to do a make sure tonight we cover the uh Advanced forms of dark okay oh where should we start where should we start, ah, okay uh this old uh, sketch uh sketch is still uh viable here think about the dark yeah not really okay feel the dark okay a little bit easy finer feeling good another more sensing the dark okay so, that pattern uh and just think about the dark when we think about dark okay feeling finer feeling, finer feeling finer feelings sensing the dark okay so that practice still holds true okay where the hell am I going to start uh there are three major darks that you that you will bump into the first major dark is when you physically die okay ah and at first you'll probably still be attached to your body self and your family and stuff and to adjust and not, existing as physical person anymore but some place there the dark should happen now, if you don't understand what the dark is if you had no practice with it it's possible you could negatively react to it ooh dark at which time uh you're not taking advantage of it we'll get into how to take advantage of it uh you're not taking advantage of it so uh the way I image it is you're standing in line again to come back here not having really developed okay so I always thought about it uh as, coming back as the same level, character you were before but I've heard since I've been playing with this uh that not only could that happen where you don't come back having developed but you can even come back, Dumber whatever word you want to use there lesser uh so this coming back too fast is a shame okay and it's a shame that one would come back with lesser than uh than their earlier cell and lesser because they didn't take advantage of how it works okay just not on yet he's working some Stanford stuff but I'm here he's here Sensei oh he's here uh I think there was something you said right there uh oh you said a New York vernacular yeah sounds like Karma or something yeah I said I said there, are likely causes and conditions or certain conditions that might bring you back into a into a, less a lesser state or uh I mean that's, kind of the lore a little bit of the lore of the of reincarnation and so on but yeah it's, uh it's generally we're in a flow hopefully of development and uh an increase, yeah so it's uh yeah that's you know karma, is just a word for cause and effect you know okay not a belief so you come back dumb or you're carrying more karma could I say with you all right well kind of I mean you're carrying the effect the effect of your actions the effects of your of causing you know the effect of actions anyway so yeah I thought you didn't develop and then I heard kale that you can even come back a little bit Dumber so whatever you're gonna do with that anyway okay so that's stack okay ah be I want to get into the positive as soon as possible but uh, what's coming to me right now is the uh negatives of it if you move into dark change diagrams come on page where is he where'd he go where'd he go he was here foreign there he is you can tell this is another drawing not a country drawing uh let's see let me try if you try to approach let's we're putting it down that dark time here okay uh if you if your approach to it uh or should I put this is too narrow okay too narrow or we could say for Bobby tries to approach uh even Robert maybe but anyway definitely a Bobby if you're too narrow the dark you run into could be very thick, okay, in some form think and I'll span that word out uh heavier uh ickier okay and right there is where at first you might run into quote the, monsters that's why, I brought up the snake pit when I first one of my earlier sittings was under there's snakes all around biting me yeah okay going at it a little narrow yeah things like that could show that way uh Noah what's, her name the wild animals Saint Therese at some place in her sittings ran into wild animals biting at her, what the hell is this uh so anyway one trick are your basics if you're going to settle with dark under, or just yeah and try to get Fuller and better with it your Basics easy settle open shifting from idea to feeling to a sensing, finer sensing more room so all your Basics settle open more room 15 different thinking the sensing then click okay so that when you hit this darker uh you're not narrow and you're not picking up at the first icky effect you're picking it up could we say at a better Dimension level of the dark okay so go ahead it's small you hit the heavy, be more open be a finer settling and you hit the finer of it okay and tonight we'll highlight that and play with that a bit where the hell am I uh foreign in the doctor's book uh even Alexander he talks about a couple of stages of his in, his uh crossing over uh, temporary death where they call that again uh near-death experience nde okay and his nde he hit some dark and it was kind of icky he wanted out of there okay creepy crawlies yeah it smelled like uh this is the heavier of it this is this way before the will show us nutrients fertilizer and nutrients and all that nice stuff okay so he hits that level of it and he wants out and then saying I want out of here something happened he moved into a little better light world okay so a certain amount of Dart, the potential of a little better light world, after a bit he went back but after having experience a little better ah the light World there when he went back he was hitting the dark at a bit level and it wasn't quite as icky there were some nice things about it okay uh not putting him down because he's doing good work and I don't know what he's done since he wrote the book uh but it's even more than he was saying in, the book still I shouldn't say anything because he's still around uh a bit of a negative change like oh this is something that's there therefore I've gotta hang out with it and again it's nicer than that as we do it properly the niceness of it and the more true nature of what it is can show okay so anyway I like doctor's book in that he went from icky to hey this isn't too bad I'm trying to be all right so there's your basic right there okay ah Bob you had a story here uh somebody uh was that a an nde yeah it was an nde was wasn't it yeah I had a friend who's really interested in Andy's and he uh referred me to a person uh he had no uh prior uh even acknowledgment that spirituality had any place in the world he was uh kind of heavy duty human right a dedicated materialist so to speak yeah uh anyway he had this nde and he found himself in this very dark place and he had no frame of reference for how to work with it except you remembered when he was a small child his parents had taken him to Sunday school, so even though the guy was a highly educated college professor at the time the only thing he could think of was some of the lessons that he had learned as a young child in Sunday school so he began to try and invoke those lessons to get him out of this dark place as soon as possible long story short he ended up uh becoming a highly dogmatically oriented Fundamentalist in which there was only one way in which in which there was only one way in which you could survive these kind of icky experiences and that is what his life work was, to, move people in that direction so he, he found a way out but it was in a very, narrow band yeah which in my opinion not only didn't serve him but since he has somewhat of a following isn't serving the people that listen to him either yeah so some experience in the dark doesn't like it uh gets out of it moves into some brighter light world we would surmise and then when he wakes up from his nde he's retaining some degree of the light World thing he becomes more spiritual and we say a bit of a leader but still has that negative feeling about the dark that's too bad too bad but that's a partial okay so I don't know let's hope some of these stories are green a bell for you if not soon they will okay what should we do I think instead of doing too much with the icky what if we play ah with it's nice okay the dark underworld is nice okay easy oh that's a nice idea settle open a little more room easy the eye self sensing cells, so it's a sensing, cells, so it's a sensing unit could I say and taking the Approach at this dark immersion okay we'll just do a fairly quick dunk okay ready dark immersion riding the dark Down Easy no thinking you don't need feeling you're shifting to sensing and my first touch on it was just some dark Germany dark covering it was a little bit better Easy settle sensing it fine you're sensing the dark at its fine level it's finer Dimension it's finer truer of the dark mind for example is I'm starting to feel calmness here it's funny I've got a little piece of me that feels like it wants to get its head up out of the water and using that metaphorically ah so I can breathe again and so this little piece of meat that sort of wants to come up to the surface even though a larger piece here was calmness okay, let's make another pass easy, a sense that it's finer let's sense, that it's finer let's sense imagine it's fine and easy that's it's finer the down dark that movement of down Darkness yeah what is potentially enjoyable playing the game what's your sense of why you like it let me see for me the calm is very nurturing the dark calm nurturing role together for me okay, um, I forgot what mine was here let me hit it again a lot of worries that I may have had and I don't recall what they may have been or anything like that but don't seem to exist here there is a, probably following the calmness nothing and nothing to do nothing to worry about this is really kind of neat one more time and be ready to kick back some, feedback here easy one more time down playing the game hey this down dark trip easy sense feel what's that doing for you what's your experience, mature experience for me a feeling that I don't know soon I'll be able to start fresh or I'm ready to start fresh that's mine okay we did a couple of few there uh, what's nice about it for you all y'all and it's comfort feel very comfortable and also there's recognition well I recognize, where I am and the dark recognizes me yeah for those people that think they're fading away into nothingness something like, that you're still there somehow or other and you're recognizing somebody there okay yeah okay that's better and oh my God I'm gonna fade away until nothingness no, I gotta get out of here yeah um for me it was at first peaceful and then they seemed like there was a support in there they're supportive in some way okay remember let me hang with that one for a second okay peaceful yes and someplace under support for me in researching doing what I do I would once I've felt experience the support, I would hit it again with a sense of what kind of support or what does that mean and let it show again at even a little better level okay just a trick of the trade give me a murmur Amy for God's sake okay it was it was you know the supportive was it was okay to let go and that there was some sense of um something had me something it was safe in some way was safe I could let go okay it's but that was that was my exactly I think her Life's a dark and he's played with the dark and I believe he said it was kind of like uh what he would he call it when you're the fetus and the were in the womb it was like being in a room, you can let go because you're going to be taking care of you're, in a womb and I thought that was that, yeah I can buy that I could see where one would get that experience there yeah, you're safe you're being cared for yes it's okay here yeah somebody for me Dusty it felt like I was going down like a tube like a shoot like a tube I took a two but then like taking it when you were talking I was like oh wait I can put my hands out there and what I liked is that I can like it's almost like there was paint along the sides of the tube I could like slow myself down a little bit yeah, good whatever's on my hands yeah remember Dusty that's your pattern we've been over you again and again on this you can go on small and the energy pushes you back up out so doing the same thing but getting better now you're getting better you went down the tube but you realize you had room there was room it was bigger yeah you weren't locked into this tube so we're moving along here now you could have if you had listened to what I said about before we hit the dark we settle and we open and there is more space so that so that you can possibly hit it in its Fuller and Fuller, of it so you can save some of the tube Time by doing a little better job right before you start settle open there's more room easy the eye, a sensing easy a sensing more room easy sensing finer and someplace there now let's go for it okay coming along no thank you uh, okay we're somebody, okay nice inside it's Nikki from New Zealand um I got a sense of really warm thick gloopy mud um as I was going through it um but it was really interesting because when I came out through the other end of it, was uh like I'd been cleansed so I felt like I shared my old skin going through this yeah um it was like a, health mask you know when you put on a facial mask and you're supposed to like um bring out the clean and healthy skin that that's kind of what it felt like going through this warm dark mud okay now uh a warm dark mode okay uh still a little heavy and as you make a better more open approach to it even finer level so okay so far but as you get better at this uh you won't pick up mud it'll be finer dark, okay, uh, and, bigger, finer and the ability of staying in there longer yes from that you will move into I call the next light world or the next level of life world uh and you did it but look okay no, no problem but in a certain way for the bigness of it a little fast okay so fast okay so no, problem that's okay that's okay it's okay uh but to do much more advanced work a bigger Longer time in the dark okay longer so okay yeah in the finer I don't know what to call it finer level to find your Dimensions or the finer of the dark you have to sense imagine itself because it is but to get to that level since imagine could I say okay, but that was good A little bit of dark and then because of that bit of dark the next person is cleaner and raring to go a little bit like what I said where I felt like uh I forgot what I said but something similar to what you said yeah feeling it uh soon I'm gonna be therefore ready to go kind of thing okay so no problem we want to get a bigger of it, yeah, okay thank you all right thank you okay I hope I said that right uh another one somebody okay uh one of the first majors of a big dark when you die okay the better Fuller you can be there it's, make up a word transportation to the next uh to a much finer level if you just touch the dark and then bounce back out of it uh you'll either be the same or even a little a there should be by using the dark a better level available to you the better Fuller deeper easier calmer ride the ride, the ride, uh Susan and I were tracking one of her uh patients who had died and she liked Zoe to check them out and he was doing a dark like it felt to me like a parachute he was just enjoying this nice easy parachuty flavor ease it was just a happening, ah and just big and deep and easy uh and I recall he got to a pretty good level a pretty nice light world it was a it was an advanced light World very nice very nice uh so that ah sense, anyway where are we um okay so in a death trip and we're all going to get there eventually not you autumn you you've got a ways to go yet but the rest of us a lot of gray hair out there or no air uh as I checked my camera here uh, the better you handle are present in the dark not panicking easy, you'll get to a much better level of self okay uh quick repeat on Henry Kono uh because in Henry connell's way he was okay with the grounding dark uh and so when it got to an astral plane a finer dimensional level he was the more advanced there so he immediately was recognized as such and immediately had a group and he's the mentor of them okay, and one reason he was able to get to a nicer level was he was okay with deep so however he approached that but again he was an Aikido guy in Japan with me and uh so the roots the deeper of things to get to a better level okay, so that's your first the one of the first main ones oh God that if I want to stop here for a bit or move on let's stop here for a moment at that level first main one is the dark at after death okay and, you write it you write it better you write it the better finer Dimension you can be in okay so take advantage of it utilize it so that you can more quickly faster continue your development we're always the trip is returning back to our more original itself so this is part of the journey ah anything can be said right, there before I mention a couple other big dark moves say this is Lauren uh what you've just said now about connecting the return to our original Self as uh, transitioned Through The Dark to our original Self I always had the idea the original Self is somehow bright and glowing well yeah they're talking just a vehicle and then there's light you say what did New Zealand do she went through some muddy warm dark and then she's light again and clean hey you got it yes sir you're not going to stay in dark forever this little transition thing okay when you go to sleep you don't go to sleep forever you wake up in eight hours, hey you're ready for the day you take a nap for a half an hour hey you wake up more revived that's why we brought up all those old examples dumb examples but for people they're good examples look at don't you stop and catch your breath sometime that's it that's an example we're giving them kindergarten levels that are important okay, all right all right oh I'm at the bottom of a flight of stairs but I'm a walker I'm not a stair stairs but I'm a walker I'm not a stair climber oh give me a moment oh yes stair climber here I am now that pause at the bottom of the stair that momentary pause ah so that the next mix are through the through that pause which is a short, form of dark through that pause hey I'm a stair climber bing, bing, so you don't get immersed in the dark forever and ever and ever it doesn't work that way all right and if you think so you're not going to go into the dark when you die you're going to say no I want to continue to exist and you've just screwed it up you're going to come back as a Lauren again or less than Lauren because I got the word that it even goes a little tighter in many cases okay I always thought they just came back at their normal IQ level I'm sorry to use that phrase but uh but apparently they didn't even come back a little stupider, anyway, so, and so this is why it's important uh to have a sense of this before we die we're all we're all going to die you older people not you young people you're older people are gonna die okay take advantage of this don't be afraid of it okay oh okay so I need story from teacher maybe Noah let's see uh practicing guy teacher I am here uh, uh the famous uh the famous guy yes famous guy uh the Dalai Lama thank you that guy I've had the good occasion to, sit with him from time to time over the years and um he's also written a book on, uh it's called, advice on death and dying and he also has a practice that he says that he does every day and that practice is kind of settling into the reality that were that we're all gonna pass away at some point so that it you know there's no real fear you know by, confronting by coming to the threshold of that of that Darkness you lose the fear of, uh what's often there for human beings for all of us in, a certain way until we practice with it a little bit practice and understand that, death that, sense of darkness is a um is just a membrane it's a boundary it's not an ultimate um end or not an existential end so he practices he says he talks about in his books and his various writings he practices settling in it's not like practicing dying per se but it's practicing going into that you're just tickling my line well uh in Tokyo sit on my couch at night and practice dying I mentally cut my wrist and bleed to death and, I take it slow to see what all the reactions were you know like oh what about my wife and oh, wait a minute I tried cleaning at the dry cleaners I didn't pick up or whatever uh just to practice this practice yes so you have to say practice, yes so you have to say practice dying but practice uh practice going to the to the threshold going into the space of, Darkness yes yeah and uh the seeming mystery of it not that you're gonna solve that but you get used to it so that the, qualities around the fear of dying begin to lessen at least at least lessen their listening um if not uh disappearing yeah, yeah there's nothing to solve here by the way sorry TJ nothing to solve for that nothing to solve itself yeah well that's all thinking you know we know what happens with too much of that so, uh and uh no I wasn't there a Christian somebody or other I, Die daily uh Saint Paul said uh Saint Paul said uh Saint Paul I died daily was he practicing this realizing the importance of dark to bring you to a finer Dimension level of yourself okay in the prom House of yogananda's commentary on the New Testament he says exactly that about the line that you just quoted okay all right ah where are we are practicing I remember uh what was I yeah goodbye oh yeah I was fresh from Japan I was visiting my brother up in Antioch and on the highway and it was a near-miss accident which would have been a Total Wipeout for every everybody I mean we're all going fast and weird enough and my feeling then was oh maybe it's my time to pass over and I'm kind of looking forward to it but cards went spun a few times it was okay uh but I remember that moment or moments before where I was like this isn't interesting so that there wasn't any fear of death and I noticed that, there was like oh my God what's going to happen here stuck with me for a bit anyway oh hey oh hey so again at this level uh any questions uh we're, at the crossing over dark level that the better presence in the dark there will be some light showing okay, I think I should caution because so many people know there's a light at the end of the tunnel that some people in the in the dark tunnel will be looking for the light instead of enjoying the time that letting go to the dark letting the dark Journey continue because they'll have remembered light at the end of the tunnel and they'll get out of the dark and hit another light Dimension but maybe not as anywhere near as advanced as they could have gotten to if they had rode the dark okay went along for the dark Journey experience did I say anything intelligent there so any questions in the in the dark of the passing over a Time nothing really there's, one thing that, you said and that you've that you led with tonight that I think is very interesting um you can't really think your way into this I mean some, thinking is maybe interesting but even feeling so when you talk about um uh thinking feeling and sensing the sensing part of this really allows greater access in the most incredible way and yes it is uh it takes a little bit of time some practice with sensing so that you're, comfortable with that and not only comfortable but that you, feel yeah I think as Amy was saying earlier you feel the safety in that space of the of the radiant Darkness as it were yeah you know yeah, and Samuels likes to Dart I didn't use the word radiant I forgot and a there's something sparkly there for him I forget what it really is but something's like sparkly it was more than just dark it was a dark with that something you know yeah anyway so I always like the terms like luminous Darkness or radiant Darkness I think they're poetic for sure but you know it's interesting nevertheless yeah it kind of opens up the, feeling that darkness is not just that closed container and you can't feel anything finer dimensional sense yeah, you're in a container you're going to say get me out of here when we were doing the practice earlier uh I had to real I really related to what Amy was saying and when she was saying that there's a sense of safety but I was feeling like Closer To Source this is closer to self to, Source in this, in the darkness and that's a good sense to have I think in a dark Journey it's sensing I mean right it's even more because it's getting closer to sorts or at least more original of me yeah, yeah that's right yeah that's a nice flavor to have there yeah so with practice you can naturally have that flavor yes yeah in practice that's right ah, okay uh okay uh he did we lose that look at that one yeah no, just the other one uh the overlay you had it okay, uh so okay big dark when you die ah, the this is Manifest here okay and in the Manifest uh we have our basics for developing or whatever Bobby easy settle Robert uh easy settle not do okay or one bite or two by two three by a Bad Day to a fair Day to a good day you've got some type of practice that you do you do to be a little better person whatever better means calmer nicer stronger whatever better perfect at a certain point now that better to better to better goes on virtually forever here in this manifest, but you reach a certain point uh, where because you're because of your Harmony experience you're balanced okay better level of better dimensional level whatever Robert better level Harmony you're balanced you got a Bobby tour Robert to a natto okay so that's your pattern to develop now, at a certain level uh let's say uh a three by two or four by or a nod or Robert to Nado possibly right there right around there 'll be the sense of self okay, and possibly there the dark could suddenly show all right and potentially confuse people okay, here's where the Dark Knight of the Soul comes in okay so imagine somebody on the spiritual Quest and they're meditating and developing whatever and suddenly after a bit, after whatever some years we'll say uh suddenly it's all dark that night of the soul and they're feeling this darkness and they don't know what the hell it is okay, when there's enough balance at a good enough level again Bobby can't pull it off but not though to not those Sensei no police are on in there okay uh a three by two a four by maybe run in there okay that may show Dark Knight of the Soul okay, ah let's see okay now you're used to developing let's call that a linear development Bobby, Robert Nado sensei okay and this dark thing happens it if and not knowing that it's okay that's part of the game you could freak out and get out of it and not doing your practices, they've got you there like I was meditating and suddenly got all dark and weird I'm not going to meditate anymore ever so that would be unfortunate but that has that happens okay uh the other thing is uh at first you don't have a, sense of how things work okay because you've been using whatever as a reference suddenly this thing kind of locks it out okay so you lose all your normal references that got you to a good level you've been coming along you're special everybody will tell you you're special and suddenly this thing is happening what the hell is going wrong okay again if you're okay with the dark it will show potentially right then and you take advantage of the dark you write it and then it'll bring you to a better level but you're starting to uh starting to shift from the Manifest style to The Domain we're talking here domain W better word right now the domain uh which [Applause] is a good training ground okay, before what I heard from Oak Sensei was that it's like a laboratory a gymnasium a live Library you hang out there and, you're a much better level self-sensing and you get a much better sense of the earlier part of creation because in the domain here in the finer earlier part of creation and your workout stuff there and go okay and then another big dark can eventually hit there and that'll shift you from the domain level to the uh Heavenly I call it Divine, level so a big dark when you die a big dark someplace when you're squared away in harmony uh better balance okay if you don't know it could show that could be the Dark Knight of the souls okay so uh let's see uh Noah who was uh Saint John with the crowd what's that the Saint John of the Cross so he actually coined the phrase Dark Knight of the soul and wrote a very famous book by that title 1591 or something and he passed away in 1591 that's correct pretty good for a Catholic kid in those days uh I had the Inquisition breathing down his neck yeah they weren't trivial guys to deal with in those days yeah like in anyone that's experiencing as opposed to just mouthing it spiritual stuff yes uh those guys would get on your case yeah anyway but beautiful piece of work he did he added two more names here so we got the first this, first Dark Night of the soul and then next one Bob it was uh Dark Knight of the spirit okay so now you catch that year I would call Self sometime but self Spirit same thing uh you start to catch self uh, spirit, another one okay and then he had a third one there next one well no the, there were there were different stages for each of them so yeah in a little different way but those were the two Dark Knights that he talked about, what he also talked about was looking at it from the transition perspective of the person the person and he called that moving from being a beginner to a proficient was his word and then to the person of Union when he got to the Brass Ring he didn't say pressure no he called it Divine Union yeah okay he was what was called the doctor of the Church of which there's in 2000 years of Catholicism there's lots of saints there's about 30 doctors of the church the church and specifically he was considered the gold standard for contemplative Christianity and is still today yeah so he was a hell of a good mapper apparently, and experiencer or to be a good mapper you got to be an experiencer uh anyway otherwise it's just mental, awareness but who get lost anyway so dark, and dark uh, did I did I get lost did I lose you where the hell are we hello out there in the world hi, since Mark here yeah Mark here um you said it right wow, this must be another level [Laughter] um I'm finding this uh conversation quite, um fascinating because a while ago um we were doing uh self runs pretty good so we're doing runs on the on the self experiencing the self and um and in my own time my I, had quite a I haven't I needed this once but I had quite a interesting experience because I was really trying to feel what self was like and sense it and it started with um a glow and then I hang with that for quite a while and then it, felt like glass, and then and then all of a sudden I was in a really dark space you know and I it was kind of what you said I was thinking for a moment I was like I was really surprised I was like what yeah well what, what, is this um but um but because of these lessons and, in the way that you've you know been presenting and stuff I kind of knew just to hang there and, I and I hung there for a, really long time but what felt like a really long time but, I was kind of cool with that because I was I had this, feeling that okay there is some there is something here and um and, then sure enough it started with it was just a like a little light and, rather than going to it, sort of came to me yeah and, then all of uh like in a it's a group, and talk was it was it was me and it was absolutely blinding it was it was quite, phenomenal um the story doesn't end well because I sort of got kicked out of there but yeah, that for a moment uh but for a moment yeah but I um yeah I still got kicked back out and then but, it was yeah it was it was the way that you told the story it was um exactly what I experienced there yeah so, yeah but that being caught by surprise you're doing nice work nice work nice work and suddenly this thing happens I mean trying to give everyone a heads up on doing nice work nice work nice work and somebody just strange thing happens easy remember your Basics easy don't panic double check more room easy it will unfold easy, it will unfold it will clarify easy okay or you just gut it out and hang out at the level that you're at where it's showing but it's got to be kind of gutsy there because it kind of could be thick and icky and you know the snakes are biting you easy I'm in I'm meditating what's a little bit snakes biting me easy I don't remember what words I use then but kind of easy, you're meditating so it'll be easy here let it unshow itself again whatever words I was using in those days uh and then the snakes showed they were energy movements a little had a good sense about energy I said oh energy spirals continue they were smiling energy spirals continued and eventually it came from this very gorgeous feminine place it's beautiful yeah uh so I kind of gutsied my way through the biting snake and stuff uh but I'm trying to give you all a heads up easy open let it unveil itself let it unfold and I gotta figure this out uh no who's going to figure it out Bobby Dear God double check your exactly opening allowing more space easy let it unfold let it clarify okay, yeah so thank you yeah thanks foreign people don't know about the dark because sometimes they're doing good work and they run into it and they don't know what they'll make of it so they run away they make up stories how horrible it is uh and don't hang with it in some form okay so, look at the truth of it the beauty of it in its own right and what it really does can show okay it's not an ordeal it's not a, trial by tribulation is that the right phrasing would that be the right reasoning is that something horrible you got to go through okay, I went through some of the horrible because I was approaching it smaller not knowing some of the tricks so it hit me heavy but I got saved my way through and I hung out until it clarified oh pretty cool okay now what's her name Bob saying whoever say Teresa Saint Teresa whatever she was doing sitting meditating praying and some of the wild animals biting at her oh her snakes oh yeah okay I know what happened where she's at because same thing double check your Basics that'll open it more room very easy it looks like sensing sense this stands this Shriner sensing so the more truth reality of it can show through faster would I miss would I miss somebody where the hell are we here since you said earlier that there were three dark three dark that we will encounter the first death the second being a transition but not in order uh but the next one will be uh transitioning from the Manifest to the hidden the hidden domain yeah and the third at the Domain to move into the uh from the domain to the divine okay thank you and by that time that the domain to the Divine you pretty well are really okay with it and uh I had the feeling that you're almost invited or if it's sitters say oh yes welcome boom, there's no hesitation or something by that levels uh you're kind of Home Free and the words hard to talk about some of these levels uh because we're, don't say we're talking purple to Green people it's very odd very hard well we do the best we can okay since I teach you here we're just uh reflecting a little bit on what you're just saying and, how important it is just sometimes hear these teachings because I think that, often folks will have experiences they'll come to the come to the boundaries or the or even get immersed into the darkness and they'll be repelled away or frightened and that's not une that's not necessarily unusual that's why we're doing this class exactly, sorry yeah that's right so um the I think the, term I was talking with you about was to normalize to understand uh even to begin with conceptually that, you might reach you know these different places yeah and uh and understanding or hearing the teachings helping helps to normalize that experience I like that word people normalize, nice word normalized it's something that to many people are before uh it's icky or whatever and to know this is natural this is how it works this is what's going on to normalize it okay they think they're the only ones or we often you know I've been in different experiences and, you, hear the concepts of what you're supposed to supposedly supposed to experience in meditation and what you often experience is way different so a good guide or hearing these kinds of teachings helps to normalize that so you realize you're not out of bounds in your experience you're just in a different ex expression of it yeah, yeah we've got to be very free uh with people see we have certain, uh rules or maps that I try to lay out but within that it's you it's you that's right and so uh you know I'll never be a musician or not this like anyway that's TJ's thing that's him okay I'll never be a whoever that's your job but the guidelines should be good enough that everybody within their chosen being and find themselves okay unfortunately a lot of people don't know how a lot of teachers don't know how things were and they lock you into no you gotta experience this uh instead of what are you experiencing now sometimes we do class things that's everybody experience uh brightness okay and so we can funner on as a group with something but it doesn't mean uh that your first goal around is going to be bright it might be calm it might be invigorating it's yours it's yours okay so we try to allow some basic Maps but exactly your experience is your experience, okay yeah thanks for that nothing yeah uh Sensei Bob here has to support what you and TJ were just saying about normalizing it uh the people I've worked with who were spiritual directors and modest series that they call them novice Masters and their job is to take the, new recruits so to speak and work with them and they all say that it is absolute inevitable as people will get into the uh life of spirituality in this case in the modest area of the convent that this happens it's it happens to everybody at some point in time where they run up against the limits of who they are at that point and one of the big benefits of the dark if you accept it is it helps you to let go of that so you can become more, yeah it, confuses people because it's a bitter quite a bit of a shift of styles, okay because again Bobby to Robert to not know I got that down pretty damn good, okay I'm looking forward to next better one kind of thing so that's a nice style it got me to where it got me suddenly this thing happens I'm not sure what's happening again Basics easy and as it unfolds you realize foreign what's the words it's a different level of experience you did enough on the linear manifest uh you did enough good enough and you get this urge that's calling it's something okay so I don't have to call it another Direction, uh your Basics will still hold true but not the basics of your linear development form but certain Basics will still hold true but anyway there's a lot of confusion right there right there so if you're a say a meditator or somebody spiritually developing and you run into a major confusion kind of thing you might surmise that's happening that's happening okay and in a certain way you won't be able to figure it out with your thinking brain definitely uh or by what some people do there is they pass on it so to speak and they continue their development Mr nado Mr special Nado and they continue that uh not catching hey this was an important thing if you recognize it as important hang in there a couple little tricks easy Don't Panic settle open sense, uh suddenly some breakthrough a major breakthrough not just another dimensional Bobby Robert Nado breakthrough this is I don't know another worldly breakthrough you're the you're, you're in that whatever color that is uh again I feel like kindergarten colored so whatever color that is you're in that color, okay, and you can be in that color and still be here okay oh it was practice you retained that color that level of being better and better throughout the day potentially okay the way the forces work you'll of course lose it but you know how to get back to it faster better right okay where are we uh Sensei Danny here just like you um the first time I came across darkness in meditation was I was a young man I was about 23 and I'd left, farming, and I was living in town child married and I was working in a very dark Factory it was like there was furnaces it was noisy and I, was Finding very, difficult and um and I was a bit of a freak on meditation I thought it's the best thing in the world but I had this experience of, darkness and really, comfortable the outdoor because it felt great it felt like a relief it felt like I'm supported here and I really like this place and I started to move and wander around not really knowing what was going on and I, could and in the experience of the dark that I've had I can never remember leaving the dark but it was quite profound I had no one to talk to really and um but I felt good about it and I noticed in my life in working in the dark in the furnaces and the Heat and the noise I felt much better I, actually stayed there for 18 months where I thought I couldn't stand another minute of it so [Applause] see when people are at work working at a job this is maybe the site here uh and they think I've had it uh, there's two possibilities one is yes it's not your job move on okay the other is but the job is okay but the level you're doing the job is for Bobby is running out if Bobby Robert now let Robert have a sense of that job and see if Robert wants to stay because it's a better level so we don't know at first when you want to leave your job whether it's whether you're right that the job is bad you've got to get out or you have to click one more level Okay so Okay so that was a little sideline on this but anyway thank you Danny uh a quick, one to uh Gina, you like the dark you said tonight Gina somebody who likes the dark as much as you say you do should be saying something here the dark that I was used to was I would from Days of old and always would go there first and then move into a new level it kind of it was a place to glass off and you know be able to shift but about two weeks ago I hit this one and it's different man there's no question this is a whole nother thing when I hit this one it blew my mind and I couldn't I'm embarrassed to say even though you're all your teachings I couldn't stay there it was so dense it's like dense and I couldn't move and I just thought oh I'll come back and for the past two weeks I've been working on getting back and I kind of touch on it and I did ask you know what is your job what are you doing and it said to open you up girls yeah so and today interestingly enough this morning I thought and I hit it and I went okay I don't hear if I'm sitting here all day I'm, get I'm going through this I'm gonna and I and I didn't want to force it because that's usually me I want to get let's get this going hurry but I just thought no just you got it too tight yeah as easy as I can and boy I blasted through into the most joyous loving smiling on My Face Place it was it was something else you're right so yeah but it was not my big dark of old it wasn't that which I haven't gone to in a long time since you started on this center circle thing I haven't been back I don't need that anymore I did a quick check on you I'm good I'll tell you a week or so ago I haven't said that your early sense of dark was an idea of dark I couldn't feel you having the sensing presence in the dark so I think maybe that was the difference here that just started this is different because it was marvelous presence dark so yes it wasn't just your idea of dark whatever this is serious time and again remember the tricks that we, mentioned before you start seeing you said it I go at it well you go out and earn your, I want to catch up with all you guys yeah you're doing the tune form and that fact uh so take those minutes to settle and open have a sense of finer Dimensions available and go through the dark with that sense of finer easy and it's even finer easy and sense experience sense experience yes um yeah good sure I'm working on it but again a main point also is how the dark broader to such a nice place yeah that's great so that's kind of what we're trying to lay out really take advantage of the dark because it's a job is to bring you to a nicer dimension and it can be a very fast form of moving through da, da, very fast for the dark it was definitely a sense of this is what you need for what's next you gotta get to this opening level bigger place this is yeah if we're going to make a good transition into the domain then yes so that's what's next for you yes okay yes yeah yes okay I think people are running towards the end anything we cover everything okay that I it's Mike from New Zealand um Sensei I was just reflecting on I had a tremendous fear of the dark as a kid and um many of us but go ahead well it would just be wonderful if there was some kind of I don't know books or something that could be um obviously couched in the right way for kids that could introduce the idea of the dark not necessarily being a terrible thing you know I just because my god um and I don't know you know I have no idea where it comes from but it was it was severe sit down and see if you can write such a book well good idea indeed, see if there's a bigger message for you a bigger something for you, yeah, otherwise you want to get meetings yeah how would you present this to kids and I, don't quite have the time I'm running out of time here so and I don't know I wasn't I wasn't necessarily suggesting you I just it was it did seem to me that I would have benefited a lot if there had been something available like that no it'd be nice to have more advanced beings residing in The Human Condition it'd be nice to have a, self, finer levels of self Spirit self whatever name you want to give to it residing here and being the teachers and the mentors because a lot of those things that we don't handle properly people are doing that the boppies and Roberts they're dangerous people 's much better much better level of being, so it'd be nice when more itself or we can develop into better cells so we can do this kind of work better I don't know if I said that well but we're running out of time I'm running out of words thank you thank you thank you okay people so uh anyway practice, practice The Dilemma practices okay saying whoever practice I practice people practice, imagine yes um as you uh are aware I've been working on a project to uh teach resilience to kids and uh I wanted to invite Mike or anyone else interested in the subject to uh contact me okay and for the locals I'll be teaching Aikido starting next week on Tuesdays I mean Tuesday night I do tomorrow Saturdays with Lauren but on Tuesday nights I'll be teaching that class Aikido Mountain View 6 30 to 8 people okay thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you Sensei and be dark thank you Sensei thank you thank you Bob thank you Sensei good night everyone thank you Lauren good night thank you thanks sensei and thank you

## Aikido, Healing Possibilities, Robert Nadeau, Aikido 8th Dan,  2022-01-28

**Date:** 2022-01-28

good evening everybody okay same old story taking another angle slant on it okay the, major layout doesn't change but how we approach it uh what we use to help us continue navigate into finer and finer that can vary okay but the basic map if you would of creation uh pretty much is the basic map okay, okay healing, healing possibilities all right uh, we've covered some of the things a bit um, so we mentioned the story of it happened in the early days in aikido i remember with a lot of skiers at the time and they would break their own skiing and but we're also doing a bit of energy flow, uh in, class and uh and uh so it was not unusual it happened more than a few more than a couple of times at least a few times uh where the doctor uh said wow your bone is healing fast and it got to the point where i expected the doctor to say that with any of my aikido students who had broken their arm healing faster than the norm kind of thing okay so what is that based on [Applause] another story here i like rotator cuff tears uh okay so i've been tore up a bit uh one time i had a very bad tear and rotated can't lift your arm you can't pour a pot of coffee which was horrible, can't do that can you see mia adjust the dream jam outside the screen there we go there we go ah so i'm just running around in class and there was a an aikido guy there who's a physical therapist, and of course i can't move my arm but i settle, basic, into a little finer energy dimension no big deal just a fairly quick one adam and in that energy dimension i whatever i raised my arm i did a couple of fancies and he said you're not supposed to be able to do that well in my normal physical level i can't but easy and settling get to an energy dimensions and pretty close one and, from that level ken could do things okay for a while so following that trajectory following that trajectory following that path so basic settle easy, the eye facilitates opening up so that you're moving into a, finer inner but remember these lines here are inner lines and not out there lines when you're inner you might have some a better sense about there but the, process work we do is inner dimensional into finer into the fuller of that okay, so you had practice with a one by two by two three buy had a pretty good sense of that, okay healing, healing i think i want to present some different possibilities uh, okay so one of them might be uh let me scan oh okay the basic [Music] here we go uh the basic energies of energies down we've touched on it some classic other it's an easy settle there are energies that move up and down or if you like move down and up okay whatever is your first preference easy settle okay, energies from a little bit deeper moving up and back down you don't stay with just the idea but i need an idea to get started but the energies that move up is a after a bit more of a sense feeling ah they seem to be stopping about here you see they go down seem to be stopping about my feet flat feet on the rug level okay, [Music] okay so at the level i'm at now that's where the up and down energies are moving okay as you play with sense experiencing uh you get to measure your own in whatever form it's again easy for you comfortable for you now here on this first simple centered body approach kind of thing as the energies up and down are more in harmony or balance with each other that's the up and down sense of balance and again little practice you get to feel oh yeah that level of balance feels better than five minutes ago or whatever at a level of balance the energies are free, therefore there's a bit of a natural ah, emanation, outflow, uh let me check my system right now right now okay i i'm starting to smile a bit no reason to smile like this is happening and a real desire to straighten a bit as if something is pushing me straighter a little bit more i'm here not fantastic i'm here but more i'm here than a couple of minutes ago, okay so what i'm presenting is balanced energies at their balance point a natural emanation through that heavier i'm doing inner finer but they outflow through the heavier that's why i can feel my skin glow after a while for example or my face starts to smile or my body's affected because it wants to, straighten a bit ah it feels better as if i was in a one by one space before noun and a two by two kind of thing oh yeah, hmm okay, so, first simple set, centered energies up and down the center and as you go as you continue you'll naturally move into a little better level where the energy sense feel that they're coming up from deeper and, coming down from, higher up down at the same time for me because i'm playing with the center uh the post, pipeline that's here that feels a little fuller if you look forward so just things i notice tells me i'm moving along and this level of energy is up energy's down there and i play with those energies up and down for a while uh let me measure it my way for you energy's up seem to be about, here okay, energy's down earlier was at my feet level now down yeah feeling as a human being i'd say like my feet are six inches to a foot under the ground if i was standing outside i'd say yes my feet are okay so my beat is getting fuller up and down now there's a balance here soon it should show energy's up energy's down and they should be balanced easy to down here we go okay i think i got a balanced place it just feels like a balanced place a sense fear and the, from that balance there's a natural emanation, make up that word for now emanation out through the heavier such as my body i feel a little stronger if we were throwing punches boom, i'd let you punch me a bit not your best shot yet but you could you could throw a shot at me just for fun i'd take it for dumb example sorry up energy's down energy's easy someplace in there [Applause], they come to a balance i feel fuller my desire to move out a bit more like this it's natural i'm not making it up it's what my ah, and that sound is natural i'm not making it up ah that's what it wants to do ah just emanating more out through the body, ah, okay yeah we've and remember, remember it's not just an idea has to be some inner sense experience it's not an idea oh yes harmony in my body up and down oh yeah not a hell of a lot is going to happen okay so yes an idea and then and then the actual forces energies in this case that are moving up and down that having some room to move in easy, settle open have more room to move in they'll naturally balance with each other, are we okay so far okay, um and it's up to you once you got the sense of the game to keep playing the game, okay so see if there's next for you where or maybe the if you're getting a pipeline type thing it shows it's a bit different, for example for me often it would show from a metal pipe to a sort of a plastic clearer pipe where i can feel sense see the energy is moving up through that clearer plastic pipe okay, then it goes down deeper and therefore higher so the height to the depth and to get to the height there are partners set up there okay, and as the energies are balanced okay at the balance point i'm saying there's a natural emanation sure was we could add things later like at the balance point there is a core and we'll do that after a bit core work on a healing format and we say if there's a core of your energies mixing somewhat there ah then there's also a character i mentioned soap that a sponge character comes right through there after a bit so, can the character sort of presents itself shows itself here okay like a happening am i getting too far ahead right now ah the energy beats of up and down [Applause], and that was offense's first major and by playing there a lot he developed a very powerful body he got strong, fast from being a sickly kid uh he got very strong okay it was a long teenager he's doing feats of strength uh very fast development but he was basically working that pattern, okay in his form doing that pattern but basically centered character energies up and down making a stronger character, ah, all right all right so in that sense he went from being a sickly kid to a very strong teenager it's kind of a type of healing we could say, okay jump in give me something to hold on here before we move along somebody any comments here yeah so um when you were talking about healing and um, uh, changing and things i, felt a sense of like um magnetic and, being uh as a healer feeling like it's okay to feel magnetic and to draw out stuff but not retain it would you speak something about that okay you're jumping ahead a bit okay yeah okay let's start simple first okay possibly you could feel magnetism with the up and down forces it's like once a he and the other is a she simple approach don't confuse that with boy girl just girl just uh but one is has that sense and the other has the other sense okay, and as there's more room for them to activate and be present you might feel a real, draw from one to the next they're hot for each other okay yeah and all the way down the line uh things get very sexy i got my front yard and the blue jays are chasing each other around and then the doves they always travel in pairs okay so there's this attractive force okay yeah uh original, okay so it seeps through everything anyway um uh you're talking about being a healer i'm gonna play with self-healing okay, come at me screw you keep your crutches outside my house i'm not ready for you people, okay, yeah, good, good, good yeah, i don't have a big tent down in georgia, you following underground i know i hear you i hear you that's good that's good i'm not there i'm kind of a person yeah personal so, okay here here's a good one um when you were talking you often talk about like you know when you're um uh the hands of hands of you know when you're when you feel that sense of, your hands being alive there's a natural attraction magnetism between the hands and then putting that across your own body i mean as far as yoga is concerned for me that's where it's a lot about is like a sense of self massage and moving the energy within my own body and i feel like that's, uh what you're more about what you're talking about right it's like don't worry about anyone else check out yourself yeah, i think since they said that in all those write-ups before class started clean your own act up first, don't try to clean up other people's act take care of yourself first yeah fantastic yeah thank you but yeah the hand things at a certain level of settling finer dimension easy settle and, you know there's energies and emanating you can feel them actually and you're practicing seeing you can see them with a little darker background proper lighting or no lighting kind of thing you can see this, thing going back and forth it looks like white streaks at first a little bit better and you feel oh my god it's repulsing in oh it's drawing and what whatever you feel the magnetism of it it's just natural happening at a certain level okay just, out of um uh admiration i just want to say that one of the best gifts that you've ever given me was to say, imagine you can see something and you and then you demonstrate and then you say imagine you can see something i mean i've seen that i've heard that over the years and it's like the every time when you say that more and more and more is revealed yeah it's expo it's exposed for what it is yeah, and everybody can see things better if they settle and do the basics and get to a finer dimension and right there, are many possibilities yeah okay one is seeing the same situation but at this level you see it different, yeah, okay they remember the story as in hopefully an example betsy's father was a doctor and he was leading group of interns through the ward and they stopped at one bed like they do check them out and he was very angry with the young interns because he said can you see this guy's got a headache and nobody saw that and he got a little hurt at them like what the hell level i'm making this up now what level are you looking at this guy, yeah, can't you see which probably a bad word can't you sense feel see he has a headache right you can use you can you can use the word if you want compassion all right i don't need that word stay on track here don't add fancy word oh yes we're talking extrude that here self healing boom don't throw me off with your fancy ass words sean words sean don't, amaze me and wow me without fancy words that's a thought in effect here come the colonies stop it click, click, click, click, click, let's get there experientially and then i'll listen get you i'm not interested in draw at work anyway well uh okay, thank you sean and i tried to uh [Applause], i mentioned this lady friend i had met at ethan and she was a veterinarian and i was pretty good with dogs i was still carrying over a lot of dog stuff in those years uh so i had a fair good eye fair good eye for dogs but she could see things in dogs that was beyond me you know okay, okay so i told you the story of a little we were walking by a house on wrestling property and there was a dog out in the yard and we were having a glance at it and said oh the kids are riding on its back its back is in and i looked and i couldn't see a bad back i've got a fair good eye okay, i couldn't see if i wanted to check her out she was a new connection so i went back and knocked on the door and talked to the lady of the house about the dog and i said did you know your dog has a bad back waiting for some restore she said oh yeah the kid's right on it i tell him not to but i said damn not only did you know he had a bad back she knew why good eye had must have been a hell of a vet so you can just spot things in from a finer dimension you see things other people can't see okay now we're bringing the healers after a bit uh susan would say yes uh elaine would probably say yes uh florida, amy, no daphne no daphne diane, justin, justin, seemed to be in florida braintails are going anyway so again we're going at the same old story but i thought because of the age many of you are at and the shape you're in that the healing thing might catch your attention and draw some interest okay uh i could say baseball uh but we'd only have one steve from l.a would tune in but nobody else would uh so healing is interesting to a lot of people especially at a certain ah okay healing so the up and down basic two beat energy finer and finer and finer fuller and fuller and fuller any place of uh balance, and again if you're since feeling experiencing you can tell where that balance is you can you can feel the balance some form okay uh, such a simple, one simple one if you're interested in that one continue the beats do go down deeper and up higher they do where the core center is not the center pipeline of them will begin to show different okay that's where some of my stories came from when i teach it's like a pipeline to an oil well and the oil gushes up uh that, presentation to the students probably came from having a real feeling for a pipeline and much more energy flowing up and down and hey, hey better presentation in this case we're talking about healing okay on that one let's see a second possibility ah oops okay uh we've uh, presented do i want to do that one for a second oh no it's third second core work core work uh we we've had a session on core uh, let's quickly touch on it again uh so like everyone knows about cora these days right every, gymnasium every pilates person uh whoever core, and they're getting results because at first the first core let's call it is a physical plexus and when they get to activate that core it, lights up the whole body the whole body potentially gets stronger okay i think i had paul bowman uh, talk about when he was first introduced to, that core and he made amazing progress, uh, when he caught what core is his ways increase a tremendous amount so much it's like hard to believe you know core but because the core emanates through his body suddenly he's adding a hundred pounds on something and on and on it was a in a short period of time you know time years of training this is like fast uh but paul is kind of special in some ways but anyway that the core nation so even at that level people can pick it up physically to physical bits better is all i'm trying to say you continue easy, moving into a finer dimension easy open settle the inner finer moving into finer dimension okay the finer dimension has the core at that dimension it's your chords you okay but at that level the dimension that core begins to emanate more energy so i like to use i have used the tai chi master pattern kind of thing uh i think i presented uh the earlier level of core uh which a little more energy involved uh tight shape uh where the arm movements get, freer okay these arm things just move better that should be natural from that first or that level of core emanates more freedom of upper body movement as they continue there's another uh inner finer core and suddenly they get the legs move, better they don't have to prepare the kick it's like boom, there's a kick it's just there okay and on and on and on finer and finer, see people get stuck along the way they could get stuck at oh boy my arms are moving better my block punch is getting really i'm cool wow and they stay there forever in a lifetime okay, level of comfortableness they're happy, too bad because there is more and i had a feeling they could tap them or maybe they can't so i'll leave them alone they're happy with their fancier but they're better than the norm hey look at me i'm special okay, uh but i'm hoping you guys are more interested in the continuation or the more the more, finer more original self you okay if you're not eventually going to drop away say thank you not though i can't take anymore i call that level of comfortableness okay core chord so easy so easy settle, [Applause], you start the game there is a core easy settle open core show yourself easy um, getting a faint image of a, round ball here and i don't get caught up geez did i make that up that you're wasting time you're wasting time, easy settle open, core, core, okay now it made not a dramatic move but it's a little bit bigger a little bit lower a little sense of a little heavier okay, so, i didn't have to worry about that i make that up because this one is much more obvious to me it's definitely lower but i can almost feel the extra heaviness of it okay, and if you can't be as fast as i am that's okay i've been practicing for a while okay but, soon that would show so don't waste your time diverting okay, uh we'll lose the potential of a straighter, trajectory through all of this eventually potentially core, core now uh what is core uh core is a location open finer core shows there what is core, is where uh your energies gather, you each have your own energy mix i mean we call it color mix or we could call it quality mix let's keep it simple right now, your energy makes the, types of energy qualities that are comfortable for you that you've hooked into that you're related to and the better meaning finer inner dimensional core the better it can radiate out as a healing factor kind of like if you're more balanced with your inner self or as in herself, yeah it's better as in herself more balance, that balance exudes and we can begin to see it potentially in a healing now again there are many levels many dimensional levels uh so i would think you'd get potentially some healing effect from even the first simple level that's what we used to get with i broke my arm and i'm going to stick my arm out there and energy and they'd get results they weren't at a very deep level this was a lot more kind of new at energy flow kind of thing uh but they got results okay [Applause] when we do when we do that arm bend thing somebody bends my arm, and i just settle and open and more energy flowing through and it's harder for them to bend the arm continue, i guess i guess potentially impossible for that person not impossible for everybody some monster will come around and bend your arm you know so i don't like the word unbendable arm somebody will say oh and bend it uh but as a check for if you're at that level that should be happening oh starting to break down oh okay you need a better level you settle and open into a finer energy dimension and, add a finer energy dimension boom stronger on okay so just a check for uh, are you in the right zone see if you're just having an idea about yes i know how energy, flows dip at your arm okay or you hang in there and you energy no you're not you're straining your ass off what are you talking about uh so it gives you a chance to check was that, internalized manifesting naturally to the outer it's just a check okay it's just meant to be a check all right all right where am i going where am i going core, core so core find your core your energies your qualities it's like a, a gathering spot there we go gathering spa, and those energies emanate okay now if we're going to play with healing, i'm not sure uh i kind of if i play a bit with that [Music] i kind of say healing core in case there's a little variation of core when i throw that word healing core and i'm not sure yet okay, but definitely a gathering zone for your qualities and the finer your inner sensing experiencing them the more they can radiate out through the finer energy body you through the heavier physical body you and maybe even a bit more okay um don't know if i covered it good enough did i miss something in there is that is that thing okay yeah, yeah any comments there feel free this is justin i uh i'd like to add or magnify something that you said when we're talking about self-healing um self-care also comes to mind things that we do that we need to do to attend to our own self-need like hygiene for example this kind of checking in and, um settling and opening um can be should be done like the other things we maybe should do on a mandatory level for our own self-care um as an ordinary thing day-to-day yeah that's why i'm throwing out these possibilities what do i want what would i like i'd like people to catch on to this inner dimensional finer boom what do i have to do to get you interested in this i'll teach the golfers to settle better do i give a about their golf game i don't think so but i would teach them because if they can get centered a bit and be a little more present they got a first piece of it maybe they'll continue and go hmm what is this centering stuff because i can really hit that ball better it's smoother it goes further wow maybe i've hooked them or their own systems had a chance to hook them and continue i'll come at it any which way i have to come at it to get it going okay uh so yeah aikido techniques and all that stuff oh yeah that's cute but that's the work the inner work okay i don't know say the real work and if you like that form as your approach pattern hey cool and then i'll mention healing form and some of you are a little bit uh we'll say yes healing how do i do that inner it's the same process basically, just coming at it from a different angle okay, so i say to steve who's into ball baseball uh salahaduro now he picked up something from sensei he went from well he was a pro but his batting was not too cool and he caught on to something he became the hitting champion not just of japan but uh his score is his batting thing uh it was like wow okay you know about him if he was american unfortunately japanese so and you probably don't think much about japanese baseball but they got some good boys on there if you notice the american teams hire them sometimes so you'll say japanese players and you'll see a few american players on a japanese team so uh i don't know if they're equal but anyway sadaharu was uh caught onto something and he was hitting different than a normal human being hits okay so anything that facilitates and gives you a reason to do this work to do this process uh to catch on to the potential wows of it uh i mean didn't o sensei was trying to wow you about this by saying look it you can't defeat me and all the marshall obviously wow okay because they were interested in martial arts um and you would do little games you know, to catch your attention like to walk faster at the train station where we have to run to keep up with them uh an old man and we're young and we're running for god's sake this little game say check this out you know kind of thing, uh should catch your attention it's now it's up to you to figure out what's going on here okay but some people stop that wow sensei and that's it they don't do anything whatever, ah so, the core approach easy, kind of like a ball of energy if you would finer and finer and it naturally emanates and in there's a healing capability okay um core i'm wondering if, we shouldn't if you're advanced, don't have the core just be a, ball in your belly but it's finer and finer that the core may be equal to your whole system uh, let's say you have a you're a field okay you're a field that the core is that whole field it's not just a ball here, okay so that might facilitate i don't know if i said that well if you caught that, no big deal a ball radiating is good enough but i think it's more than a ball okay bob i'd actually say if you could say that again i think that was so important i don't know what was it you said okay that it's more than a little ball it's a whole, field of energy is actually your core yeah and, and i'll do another overlay we've got a little bit overlay going on here balance of energy's qualities okay core, character, bobby robert nadeau that's, what that meant there's a character here okay, uh an inner finer uh it's not a body character per se but there is a, a god, an inner finer energy but finer body, thing so it's possible that the core uh will show as a fullness, fullness sphere s-p-a-g-r-e possibly just be open be open uh i wouldn't worry about that the first time just play core as core play the next one a little bit finer better oh you don't have to oh boy it's as big as the body and that's core and you're going in oh yes it's core yes don't be so fast yes, yes but click, click, click, click later your clicks, get very fast later you can click clack but don't be a rush for speed don't mind a couple of click, clicks to establish basics so to speak and then just continue then now it can start to get smoother a bit faster okay, so uh so uh i wouldn't what i'm trying to say is i wouldn't skip the first couple of chords uh to go for that chord that's uh, a big sphere here i wouldn't be so fast it'll, show i'm just saying by the way if this happens to show i think that's cool seems to be you tell me that's all i can say again on that whoa where did the time go now uh any anything for a minute on, whatever yes sensei, i have sean here yes i have a feeling that there's something about um when you notice that things resonate when you have a sense that things click on another level and you don't need to identify it you need to go into it it's just a sense of resonation, and, you just go with it and, it's non-verbal non-intellectual would you speak on that no uh but uh one by two by three bye yeah good, good, that one again yep that's good that's moving from uh one by two you're, entering a three by now at first it might feel like nothing's here it's empty you don't know easy three by three by now things begin to happen i get a vague sense of a center a vague sense of the parameters of it the circle of it if you would easy, three by three, by three there's some activity something moved there's some movement going on okay, and then that energy movement mixes up core character and there you are your three by three or experientially that's just something you know you're, experiencing yourself as a three by three remember the one by one guy was kind of crowded in uh the world this guy starts to hey welcome the world within reason give me some problems i can handle them within reason it's a three by three uh so whatever you're talking about you should be able to use that as a reference okay is that all right excellent thank you sensei thank you all right, ah, healing, healing, healing, uh is diana florida on yes i'm here diana real quick in your couple's workshop did you do the energy hands partner um, no yeah sometimes it wasn't it didn't it didn't become yes or no a version of it yes but what i was going to present real quick i don't want to get into detail here we're running out of time but uh in doing the a couple sitting uh making hand contact uh they begin as they settle easy to begin to catch there's energy or you might mention it to them to prep them for it but they begin to feel the energy, currently through continue to settle and they may feel a continuation of that but more like they're beginning to in energy touch each other, than the hands okay and, eventually or soon or whatever you would you would notice their relationship is better with each other because they would say so they would talk about that oh i have more caring for her i have more understanding of her or something if you're doing a lot of that, should have shown anyway uh not to get into your business but uh and so i'd say oh we could call that couple's healing can we and what did we do we settled got to a finer dimension just happened to be in the context of a partner relationship and we settled got into a finer dimension and things begin to naturally show and happen so the couple that was saying bickering a lot suddenly here they're not interested in bickering if they really get a flavor really experience it they may not bicker at all later or very few times compared to what they used to do whatever, depends on them right ah, but it's isn't that a type of healing couple's healing yeah absolutely okay thank you all right what's our third one here oh, okay uh the uh mind body mind body big phrase and i can do i sort of don't like, the words mind body uh because of the tendency of go my i idea and that body and they think my idea and my body uh it's not quite the right flavor for it i'm for me okay but following that and following this simple one we've done more i've shown you we've done more than once i have an idea i would like to stand better whatever better means i'll, leave it open i'd like to stand better okay easy settling opening the energies are gathering i'm a little slow right now they're gathering not quite yet but they've got here comes here it comes boom, boom so that was the partnership between the idea presented and its partner the energy, okay uh so i was wondering about using that let me double check anything i missed here [Music] okay uh i don't know so let's say you're uh illness okay just basic i would like to be healthier, i would like to be healthier okay easy that idea is being presented to its partner, we need to be healthier and the energy's qualities are radiating and in my case right now they're mixing up a character i'm getting a, clean looking he's even growing a bit uh young, guy i kind of recognize him from other meditation work he's what i call the golden boy he's related to the golden, boy okay boy okay it's not just a visual picture out here this is an inner sense an inner sense okay if after playing here for some minutes or for a while you don't happen to say gee you look handsomer now i'd be surprised, i got to double check my work okay so the idea to its partner, responds, uh you could add the other things maybe uh, they respond and creating a core because the energy's quality's core, character all of that emanating to take care of through the dimensions you're in finer to the heavier that was interested in healing because he was off he was off okay so uh some possibility of using the idea to the energy and the energy response, okay whatever form uh if you got the sense of it whatever form feels comfortable whether you i use that as a core or just a uh here comes the energies and they're pervading so whatever, they're pervading, the system and then again back at it hit them again and boom they're pervading so general pervading radiating or you can throw the core in and use that as a as a reference radiation point or the character that's there characters there yeah let me see is that is that sort of okay sort of kind of maybe huh very much so yeah okay yeah i'm not sure i've been sort of involved in and out with this stuff for quite a while and i'm never sure what's clear out there sorry uh again uh again not just the idea but some inner experiential sense okay now double check because you have an idea about inner experiential sense it's tricky that that's why i like those simple checks brad one second just a light finger like look little finger on top of my arm no it's a hand little finger huh that's not a little there we go i have to get better helper on there uh and just okay, not so heavy not for starters, i'm not there yet i'm back in bobby land it's strange easy settle okay bit better yes yeah and it came from laura and i felt it like what i'm trying to say here uh it's not an idea an idea i can't quite get enough of the energy a little bit maybe but not really the energy that's better one the thing itself and to catch that yes have an idea but it's partner actually prison whatever you want to call that experiencing itself experiencing creating the character you well since i tried to tell you when he said put in your body put all this awareness stuff in your body where it gets activated as an actual something okay see again that's where he was different than just the awareness meditator types uh he picked up a piece we probably knew about at one time or forgot about or time to bring it in at this age and that was the harmony between the two forces okay, not just meditate but experience as you're meditating would be more proper experience okay, and that's why i like the little check so you can tell if you're experiencing okay, uh thank you man and brad that's a little bit here uh where the hell are we oh mind-body relationship in relationship to healing okay uh what i understand you're, saying that there that in my impression there are a lot of things that we can do and maybe should do um out there to avail ourselves of healing wise modalities but um but there's a lot that we can do and rely on our own self um that eye self inviting connecting even a little bit with that um it, it, it helps us engage with our healing process on levels that as wonderful as acupuncture and many other things are things are is only a, system of modality but it's not with the inviting of the eye per se it's just some energy as great as that is are you saying that you're considering the main work to be easy the eye to self to self easy continue to a more original self easy two and more original pure cells so eventually the more original soul beingness, is that what you're highlighting i would say that, yes that we are saying that and as healing as acupuncture other things can be, it helps us perhaps, access a state of being where, our original self is more available to us somehow us somehow facili it facilitates certain things but it eventually will come back to our own self and that relationship we can do with and within ourselves yeah and i think i'm trying i'm following all i'm trying to do is give you a, reason to do some inner work and if you're hurting or something uh i just give you a game to play where you do inner work to get a helpful hopefully radiation and you'll be oh wow i healed pretty fast the doctor said it would be a month and it only took me two weeks and i'm cool whatever, whatever they give you a reason to do the inner yes of course the real, reason is, i to self to a finer self to a more original self yes but it's okay to use things aikido is a thing you use healing is a thing you use uh talking to animals is the thing you use to get to a finer dimension where you can communicate no big deal whatever, and there's a million things that can be improved by doing this basic uh so many possibilities well this is this is what i emphasize with the people i work with of course you'll feel and experience less stress and less pain accelerated healing but, go out there yourselves not healers maybe if that's not your lineage personally i enjoy immersing in the ordinary things like sweeping the floor prepping the vegetables for dinner how have i settled touch my core more available there's evidence in my experience that i'm functioning on a different level doing the ordinary things like raking the leaves and potatoes three by i would surmise in one bite if he has to sweep the floor it's getting pissy about it some form or other it's getting pissy the two by nina a three bye might find the enjoyment in sweeping the floor from that level he enjoys whatever other benefits he's getting, which somebody something jumped in my mind, uh, when the dojo was empty in tokyo i used to go in and sweep the floor even though at the end of every class the floor got swept i didn't like the job they were doing i would go on my own and sweep not to impress anybody because hopefully nobody was there in that time of the afternoon, uh but uh but i did it for whatever, was happening then i don't remember but i remember doing that more than once yeah so a three by three year or a four by four yes dumb things can become beautiful things yeah, i did a lot of dumb things in my early years of practice move a glass over to here settling move it over back to here sadly i don't know what i was going for how dumb can you get but you see to take the dumbest thing you can start with and now in my terminology i would say and just to see feel experienced what might open up there okay, what might change there what might what might change there what might and i wasn't sure where i was going with dumb things like that i was inquiring is there anything going on here other than me moving a glass back and forth how boring right hang there and hang there and continue and i don't remember what opened up but i know things began to open up i think you remember that uh so yeah at a better level dumb is not the same dumb it's a different level of dumb that you don't call dumb anymore okay everything changes your perception your how you handle it i don't know yes sure of course so uh sensei oh, going here i, have a sense of like a sense of non-conflict non-verbal and then non-um uh, uh conceptual, if you will and, and in my mind that goes to like a sense of a complete feeling a sense of not belonging to a sense of belonging and, and not, caring to a sense of appreciation of detail okay now we're talking about it if you in your sitting are moving from one eventually to the next where you started not caring then you settled and you found out and you continued and suddenly eventually get to a place where you begin to care a bit whoa and you get finer and finer and suddenly caring if you are any experience i say yay sean you throw more words on me i'm gonna turn off my tv set here all right i'm here i'm, on you i am with you thank you dan jumping the words to other words and then that reminds me of this word uh i don't want to bounce me i don't want to bounce with those words that way i want this you might be right but you sit with not caring and go dimensional with it actually, you actually experience what happens and what your quality is actual, actual, so the person, is a caring person actually not an idea an idea you see you have an idea you're carrying and i've jumped on you on the mat about that, remember, i get you thank you, didn't understand what i was saying because in your i got you i got three i'm saying yeah but i don't see it that's why i would jump you okay i love you i love you thank you thank you bear with me anyway oh we're eating up time here people where the hell are we is that sort of okay that process uh finer inner naturally radiates uh and, if we say healing uh i think it has healing capability not that this means anything uh by ostrimeterosense one morning one day uh this is going to the bathroom which is right next to the door to the dojo open door and he stuck his head out and i'm telling you the whole class gasped, he looked like death really he didn't look well at all he looked like that i'm telling you the whole room he looked bad he said something like don't worry now i don't remember the timing wasn't a whole bunch of time but uh in a day or two, he showed himself again and he was more there, not at his top yet but another day he started to come out and do his stuff now this is an old man and if you hadn't seen him ah he looked like death and to go from that to a few days if i recall it wasn't a few weeks there's a few days to suddenly be back to a good norm doesn't mean anything but hmm interesting, so uh if you are interested in healing uh, i meant to call the healers in tonight to, say something uh susan, uh, uh, sensei ah sensei ah susan is online susan anything real, quick so we're eating up time susan well you did she got cut off looks like she got cut off looks like she got cut off sorry oh no it happens when she's coming back since not sure i, don't have interest anymore susan elaine you have anything to throw in i'm sorry sensei elaine is not here tonight not here tonight no okay and we've already talked to justin some blogged him off anyway uh, and bob i didn't bring you in bob was there in the early years of hands-on energy healing and i thought he'd go over and he really liked it so he, kept going with that and the continuation of that but i think we're finishing up here bob uh so i won't call you out unless you want to say something so that's a uh what i can say is that our practice followed the exact progression that you were describing okay from the early hands-on practice and, you also made it clear it was just a perspective on the work as a whole that we were using healing but it was just a perspective particular application of the work as a whole yeah just trying another angle on things then so we had our aikidos we're doing this in the dojo and again we touch bob because he, liked that was good at it and continued doing it he still does it in some form at whatever level he's at right bob yes nancy that's right yeah so hey every time he does it he's got to settle a bit and get to a finer dimension so that, gives him a, reason to what's the word process yeah okay people i think i've bored you enough for tonight uh sensei all right all right see you next week yeah inshallah

remember people they uh were dealing with energies all along the way I mentioned that as we go from Bobby to Robert there's more energies Robert goes to Nado there's more energies and know that, to take advantage of that uh, that you don't get pushed by the more energies now when we uh begin to be aware easy the eye and self begins to show there's a lot of energy with the self itself has a lot of energy okay and again be prepared for that don't get pushed there easy, and open shelf is there okay and the question tonight was how, do you distinguish I ourselves uh thank you Oliver somebody want to jump in on that I'll wait you out Susan are you on tonight she is Sensei can you hear me a little raggedy try it sorry I'm on the road um, certainly at that, I has an agenda that I thinks about things before doing the I thinks about things um in particular ways and, I liked Oliver's work that there's just a completely different flavor um when settling into self there's a there's a calmness there's a pervasiveness about self about self uh There's No Agenda there's yeah just a completely different flavor okay, okay so just that piece I think is pretty good uh, the eyes all along the way have activity and agendas and stuff like that and the self doesn't have those that way okay and we have to be careful uh because anybody who settles in Easy uh, there could be calmness there saying ah that self no it's just calmness or uh Susan I'm not sure what to say to them about the distinguishing basic calmness with [Music], self, okay, so probably a good word but, could be misunderstood I used to be nervous now oh now I'm a little calmer oh itself that self I don't think so, how do we just can we just distinguish that so Center can I follow me then do you want to change the word for what self is for lack of words experiencing as self there the word at the moment there's a fullness of presence um there's a pervasive yes of self I'm kind of losing you too much snow in your neighborhood I guess, yeah somebody nobody want to jump in on how you maybe distinguish what, your sense is of the difference between, a self even though it's a nicer level of self I mean that natto is a nicer level of eye as distinguished from a self anybody want to jump on that Nancy yeah see I get a sense of a person having shown up Suddenly and the person is like me a all my agendas become okay and personalized go ahead there's a meanness it's me like it's me except not the ordinary me it's um okay there we go okay go ahead it's some it's some kind of Magnificent Presence it's a much more magnificent me has shown up and I'm in awe okay but it has that sudden appearance or sense of suddenly it kind of going from not being there to being there words fail yes, that's the people that's the problem we do the best we can with words but none of them are exactly and we do the best we, can uh, so I like a couple of things in there uh that sense of oh this is me but not the normal me not the Bob and me that Robert me did not know me that who have Sensei me it's not me but it's, somehow it, gives the sense of meanness, me meanness me Ness I am I am I have always been here I've been waiting for the could we say the Lesser use to let go yeah realize I am here and I am you I am yourself something like that those words follow better, oh it's a people it's a do your best ah thank you I say it's dusty I'll say something quick if that's okay if you had a one of those pieces of paper about a month ago of the of the aisle and then the character in the south and the small high three different circles that I've been expressing myself as like a supportive like goes like underneath my character or it's like holds me up almost like uh it's very supportive and very like almost physical uh a water underneath a foundation that's what it feels like right now that's all I had to say a foundation of support yeah is that what you said go ahead um yeah it's like it's always it's like whatever people said is that there's no um it's not looking to do anything it's just chilling for me it's like just you've got you're doing it and I'm here to support you like a cheerleader kind of okay that's it I'm gonna have to let that one go because I couldn't quite hear everything here boys can come across to me, clearly thank you okay would you like me to repeat it for you for Dusty give it a shot he feels sense mostly as a supporting in a previous diagram you showed you know like concentric or uh you know separating sense uh you know you know separating sense uh you know character itself but he feels character, itself but he feels character is always just sort of Underneath Him underlying and supporting him but doesn't have a particular agenda other than to support him did that get it Dusty well the question feels like it has a mission right the um the self doesn't the self is just there to support me but the character feels like this the character he says has a mission but the self doesn't it's just there to support him yeah, probably as we get into the underlying uh later we use the I use the terms when we get a B one then as we continue two is the self that's there underlying backing up behind the one okay and as that world opens up which we call the domain we'll go over some of these words again uh then that presence of it that sense of supportiveness uh yes, yes all right but again see the words are a because any place along the line Bobby let's go easy the energies are mixing better uh and Bobby can feel supported because Robert is starting to be there and Robert is a little more supportive he's has more energy he's more, rooted grounded present uh so see there's no words that'll do this thing perfectly, okay, we do the best we can anyone else want to try Sensei this is right so one piece of this that I think is pretty important is that this is an overlay the uh the eye at whatever stage it is at the one by or the however we reference that is an overlay with the self and it's showing more and more originally you, talk about the more original Self it's not like the self is showing, the fullness of it of itself not the first moment not at the first moment so the but so the other uh overlay was with us trying to distinguish uh the self the, I character and the uh and the and the original source is a little bit challenging because we're objectifying something we're objectifying the self that's always here that has qualities like vastness and immense spaciousness um qualities, such as this as some people have said it's without an agenda and I think that's a unique way it it's, not floaty but it, is it's not trying to intervene on the on the character at that moment where we're emerging into self, um the overlay I think is important here the overlay between the character and then uh the more original yeah how's that, yeah, okay something you say why I sometimes jump in when people before people are finished is they say a nice sentence I really want to jump in and grab it because I don't remember what it was right now right now my ability to hold it hold somebody's stock for more than a minute it doesn't exist apparently pathetic maybe Lauren um a lot of you might remember okay but yeah underlying it's all here and now that's where the is yes, the over the, fact that it's overlay to try to, separate out character from self at that at that moment of the beginning emergence of that beautiful overlay um is a very beautiful moment I think I think it's Timeless we've tried to lay that out in this simpler earlier form uh Bobby and he's got all of his nonsense uh easy settle open a little more room and Roberts or not though somebody, who's better starts to be present um, uh, and because it's an overlay or an underlay sure um Bobby stillings this potentially but I'm not in that realm anymore I've shifted from that realm to the nado realm so a lot of the stupidity or whatever of Bobby don't exist at natto's level if I stop doing this practice quite likely I'll end up back into a Bobby really quick yeah he still exists but I don't reside there I reside here and then I practice a bit and I reside here okay so that's again uh to go back to simple basic why we have to understand there's a vortex a vortex and this thing can push Tighter and can for like a word to pull back and Define our finder heading towards more original yeah, I don't know how are we getting yeah that's, it and everybody that has spoken tonight has had a very nice piece of it in some ways represented for themselves the initial uh well what should we call it it's an emergence or it's a recognition of that overlay the presence of it uh of more original Self as it as it begins to show itself, that's the that's also very key and you've said this so well many times since a the self sees its, self recognizing itself it's not the small eye recognizing the cell yeah it's yeah I so this is this is Central I think to the genuine process of, uh opening settling and that evolution of the one by two by three by, any name that we want to call it oh to write that because I got the thought I'm going to lose it in the morning let me jump in go Sensei oh God oh God uh I had it I really did I had it uh feel free to cut me off uh but now I forgot what I was cutting you off about uh oh the early stages you settle in your open and you move from your Bobby to your robbery or one bite a year to buy or your bad day to a fair day heading into a good day and being something begins to be there okay we're referring to the self, can possibly show there but it's the early stages where I said what's, going on what, was that who is that kind of thing that's the early stages yes, and self has more juice so it can push you into I'm getting out of here because something strange just happened in some form it can push you because it's more juicy okay interesting yeah so easy and continue the opening give it a chance in a little more room to be more present I clearly okay it's not a distance away so I don't mean it's coming in from uh through Iowa over to Denver and then it's going to get here soon it's not that kind of distancing but uh but give it a chance to more fully be present it is but my approach to it my, approach to it I have to open up so that that's there more fully and be itself the dialogue itself could I say, uh so you want to be in those early stages continue with that double checking ease of the eye could you get an eye sort of right on the edge of this self-present and because itself is juicier the eye might start to get a lot of ideas and then and then things right easy the I still a sense of a little more room settling easy into a little more room and don't be in a big rush right there hang out with it what to say give it time give it time continue your basic pattern easy settle open Easy let it let it present itself more and more easy settle open okay, it's not that it's foggy and it's got to clear itself I'm foggy on my Approach a little bit of fog stuff here uh this easy give it some time is me clearing it's an eye me clearing my fog away so that, is here and I was been here has more room to show that it is here has more room to reflective words Express itself uh, manifest it's I call juiciness tonight it's juiciness something like that I almost said it right didn't I, think so yeah the, we're giving room in the in the processes that you do and that we do as we're doing one by two by, Nando since a process we're giving room to actually let go into, a quality of spaciousness that allows self to experience self and it's a it's, a tangle of words I'm, totally aware of that but it informs the it informs the character uh at a at a three by or four by but it's really, self-feeling self yeah and it's, one of the beautiful experiences uh in Spiritual Development if I can put it that right way yeah and why we want to are we diverging it doesn't matter uh the conversation's good uh, this presence of self as an underlying presence Factor uh I tried to present it to Danny because we're talking about health stuff as it being juicy having its own energy could I say uh that at that level the energy is much finer and if we're lined up properly here and now that energy from self can radiate through the multitude of finer physical energy bodies all the words we use there to the physical body so you can get this Inner Glow to the outer, uh Noah you were telling me a story from Chen, Manching was it yes that's it and he didn't catch on to this at first and he got sick and suddenly after it got clearer to him did you want to try that story right now well he was sort of cruising along in his life as a famous painter of calligrapher poet medical you know Chinese medical doctor and then he got tuberculosis and none of the things he was doing at that point seemed to be able to address the tuberculosis so it looked like he might die actually because in those days they didn't have antibiotics or anything and then he began to practice Tai Chi and that cured the tuberculosis and his feeling was that it brought in a uh, a deeper sense of things and that's what allowed him to get better because the radiant energy of self yeah older right there so in doing a very good call it a dimensional level of energy more energy more energy uh he got to a very deep level let's say let's say he was at the level of self-energy let's just say that okay that, level of radiating energy the, the juiciness of self that's where his healing came from because it was radiating from there out through all the energy body levels through the physical body yeah did I say it right yes I say you did yeah did yeah okay and that's what I try to present to Danny as a practice and for uh anybody that if you can get to that level or play that level uh I think there's a lot of possibilities here for some fancy stuff happening connecting in this way has always been called the ultimate medicine actually has it oh yeah I like that medicine I like that yeah very healing restorative there's no sense I say something in those Scrolls uh, about uh being the medicine for the world or, something for the world the world or, something for the world I forget what it was I said Aikido was a medicine for a sick world okay and I would infer what he meant by ikeated him he had to kill her yeah come on uh but this see for him Aikido was his inner thing that we're talking about and how it works the size of it the uh, uh design of it the self that's there the character at that level that's there all of that boom yeah, yeah, okay uh not bad discussion uh any anyone else on I to self your sense your sense Sensei Christopher New Zealand Christian can I go Chris Christian can I go Chris the working with the eye it's always a sense of well a sense of almost letting go, of something to the next level whereas the self sort of comes forth as almost a whole piece bringing more whereas that I is a shift so it's always a meeting together whereas that I process is it almost started letting go easy bi so it's a letting go of it's we're a self comes forth to me and it's sort of it's bringing a fullness not a full fullness but it's, a complete beginning yeah, so it's and it's coming forth the post of living things go it's, bringing the party the party yeah and people in the beginning if you feel a bigness with that like whoa it's still not the bigness of it very nice it showed that much very nice that much was there uh I hate to say but we're just beginning with it I'm trying to imply there's more there's more you can't say I've arrived I'm finished with this I'm whatever the religious words are I'm teacher what's the word there I'm what saved I'm what Noah help me give me a word and like I'm enlightened no he had a quick lucky Touch of self you're not enlightened yet nice to take a quick touch but let's get back at it let's open up some more let's let it be there more fully and continuing more fully we had a ways to go yet okay so at this level we're talking about there's still a lot of playing around or since they've been stressing that uh at the uh I position when the self really begins to show and the domain that much finer underlying art known everything, uh, that there's a lot of playing so we got a certain amount of the library now the laboratory a lot of playing, a lot of funny around in there he had a better sense of how things work and more experiential the gymnasium more the actual experience presence okay somebody want to jump in on I self hi Sansa it's Mike hey man um I certainly find it very difficult during these sessions to allow the self to come forth because for me it feels like in order to, see and to hear to hear I'm up in the eye because that's where I is it's, let me hold it right there a moment a moment yes of course I'm also kind of expecting you to, remember some of your past experiences and really kind of be talking from that I don't expect you in the two minutes that I gave you to suddenly be self or hear yourself now how do I tell the difference between I and self I don't expect there to be a fantastic piece of self they're not in two minutes hell if you can do it in two minutes like that you lead the class I'll follow you, so come on so come on come on okay uh yes I agree I agree um what I notice is oh no notice is the wrong word um when I am able to get in or allow the self to come forth I'm not operating from my head at all it's like my Consciousness now it's down somewhere I would say in my body at this stage and, there are no questions there are no um ideas there is just this um allowing, just the whole experience around me to happen yeah give it more room allow it to show whatever part of itself it wants to show it's glow it's aliveness it's a sense of things you know like in my case one of the first things I heard if I recall uh was uh I've always been here you've been running around bobbying but I've always been here and you finally made your way to me who's always been here so that was my first memory of whoa fancy ooh yeah no maybe definitely okay did we sort of anyone else want to jump in on that maybe yeah Bob uh Steve here um, I just like to piggy a lot of things I was hearing uh I had a similar experience and, the agenda which a few people mentioned for me I, just like to add that the stuff doesn't have any needs the when you when you're still with the eye, the agenda the needs I, have something I need I'm, not completely settled even, when I'm in a good place it's, not like the eye which has this uh overarching presence that doesn't ask for anything doesn't seek anything even on a great day you want something more yeah right so like the millionaire saying it ain't enough more the billionaire Bob behind times yeah remember I have a dollar brain which reminds me just a reminder we're more than happy to take donations Lauren said he didn't think he was getting across with his request so he said I should try it there I am donations thank you I think she could probably hear me I'll hear about this later but ishintosh okay I, sell okay uh Sensei Bob here yeah the thing you were referring to about I've always been here is sort of the defining thing for me that sense of permanence that eyes are going to come and go the energies itself come from self not from two forces coming together and joining temporarily we're before that yeah, it's you know like in the Bible crisis before Abraham was I am that's self that's what he was talking about okay yeah cool okay but let's go over it's important stuff we've been touching on so I had like to go over it again um and by the way another jump in um next Friday is March 10th which is my birthday and Elaine Yoder's birthday, uh right about there and she's going out to dinner on her birthday and I think katra's going to take me out to dinner on my birthday and I'm taking the night off so you have a night off next Friday night, off next Friday night I know she's got to think about it no, no, you promised didn't you anyway uh so next Friday Night Break take a break but let's go over some basic hair again okay uh Center Circle okay we've given it different names we say uh centered character in a circular situation or character in the world he's in character in a situation he said uh or Autumn the basic bear the actress person, given the script or being directed situation by the director I'd like more of this or more of that and that situation and this character and this character in that situation if they're allowed to do what the system is trying to do they will try to harmonize center circle, Center okay if there's a big situation that approaches us so to speak uh and we don't know how things work we're too fast to say oh I can't cope with that that's too much you see okay it could be but by law if you understand a bit how things work there's a potential for all of that energy touches here and this reacts back as energy looking for a Harmony between center circle, Center okay boom and we say things like they're like oh he rose to the occasion it means something happened and suddenly there's somebody there equal to it coped well with it made All the Right Moves sometimes almost magical stuff like, that okay so far Basics, uh now starting in smaller oh I'm more of a center type so I'll talk about it from the centered Viewpoint uh two forces just as a centered type my two-force pattern was energies up Energy's down and as I easy and settled whatever I call it in those, days uh, feeling it after a bit that oh it's coming up from a bit deeper sense of it going a bit higher and from the higher coming back down to its depth Plus okay and that as I continue there was more energy so I'm easy the eye more room the basic up and down beat there's more energy I got used to in taking more energies I could go from a Bobby, do a bit of this and it'd be a Robert more back support uh with more length of sensitivity reach whatever, okay so I use the two beat Factor just because I was a center major that was my starting place some of you are more circular major you have your own form of two beading oh I'm in the woods and the woods are very beautiful, okay very nice if it attracted your attention maybe worth you playing with it if you're interested what uh touch me a bit it's uh Oakland Amion no yeah Amy Shipley is not here okay anyway she mentioned one time on the show, how much she likes being in the woods very nicely and being in the woods affected her person character and she likes being in the woods let's say Okay paraphrase her now that's very nice oh I feel better when I'm in the woods very good not going to take that away from anybody okay, I just like to continue now, if it's the situation of woods that really sort of hits you first then maybe you want to do a finer Dimension so in this beat, foreign there's a sense of a finer Dimension what what's the what's the sense of the you will say the finer of woods I'm not going to use the right words here oh everything's alive here it is a squirrel running around and it's alive and there's a bunch of birds twittering and they're alive and they're treating oh the trees are alive finer find your sense of aliveness and earth-centered character would feel more alive I love being in the woods because I really feel alive are you following what I'm trying to do here okay that I'm a centered major slowly catching out to more how the circle works in relation okay uh, so at first you might use Center form or the circle form but then you catch oh wait a minute there's Center and circle and circle and Center, okay now again reminder continue to be open because when you realize there's two the more the energies okay, from the not so obvious one to you okay for, me when I was centering I think I mentioned this last week or so when I was doing my basic favorite energy practice up and down Center that I really loved and was getting so much out of that and then one night at the dojo by myself suddenly something happened and there's more energy coming at me I don't know what the hell's going on but my style I'm starting to get a little pissy okay pissy okay what's happening here for one thing my normal up and down Center got sort of seemingly destroyed I couldn't figure out what's happening I don't know how long it took me but then I realized oh it was just doubling up well in that case a double up means Center, up down of the center and down up of the circle and that was starting to show to me my Center was getting pretty good where the circle said hey I'm a partner to that I'm here I'm here and I didn't know how it worked exactly then so it jumbled me up a bit that I eventually there remember how long it took uh more, than an evening that oh two forces Center and circle and circle and Center so in, moving along or other pieces being added do remember it's going to be more energy there and be prepared to be open to it because if you're just holding on to your first standard my centered standard when that next piece begin to be there and trying to show that really ah not me about so to speak okay so trick of the trade as we move along and move along don't forget easy the eye is a good constant there is more room is a good constant and be prepared for their at every step decent step along the way something that there's going to be more energy okay if something additional comes into place settle open and infer there's more energy and be open to it so it doesn't push you around or push you out of the game important simple Basics important are we okay with and I call that A and B lately okay so one of them I call a the other one I call B call B we presented it in a potted plant form I thought that was kind of cute okay the plant being more the centered character and gee I don't have enough I I'd like to be a better plant because I'm in a pot circular nutrients it hears what this one said and starts to show it's there and this one starts to ah intake those energies and, I the plant grow okay so there's a beautiful pattern of plant to the nutrients of the Potted Plant and the potted plant nutrients back to the plant Center and circle okay that's just sort of the same presentation a little different picture that helps different, picture that helps different people to catch on you use one picture you think is great but somebody else doesn't quite see that picture you present them with the same thing virtually but a little different picture okay yeah are we okay so far going over early Basics here very important basics, here very important basics because they're gonna like what keep recurring nice to know where you're at nice to know how it works okay then I kind of uh thinking about it the other day I kind of really liked the way we were doing it uh last week whatever uh as a field of energy character is a field of energy situation as a field of field of energy situation as a field of energy I just thought the, fields of energy, mix and blending and becoming a Oneness was some, degree easier and, facilitated that blend so it's not that and this it's that and this and this and that one thing following me oh okay yeah if not jump in and say hey stupid I don't follow you okay, okay many forms of playing Center Circle we could just uh we could just do it as Center to the circle and circle to the center we did that at least one Friday night okay just the basic Center so the circle, to the center then we did basically the same thing but we use a chant form I said well for example from Jose he like [Music] so hi how I presented that was like okay I like eie as the center and I like Mommy as the circle as a yay calls out to the circle by law the circle response okay and now they're getting a thing back and forth okay as the harmony between those two there's an ongoing development of me okay, so that Harmony ah who am I now could I say oh I'm a Robert or whatever and more Harmony more chanting practice along the way it feels pretty good I may say okay who am I now and feel oh not oh kind of thing so we've used a chanting form a basic center circle, Center form spiraling up spiraling down of Sensei love fire water steam esoteric as hell I like that one okay I have an American Indian life where I, bumped into that on one of my I don't know what a mirror I forget what American Indians call it us Aborigines would call it on their Walkabout, a dream Quest dream Quest okay on my dream Quest I, was in a desert, type area and I was checking a little puddle of water in the heat of the Sun and there was some steam there and that caught my attention and so I played with it so fire water steam was sort of a natural for me been there before played before okay uh esoteric but, cute okay the harmony of the two or balance some of you like of the two is a doorway so that's oh steam is a doorway don't just stop at steam if I just stop at steam If I just stop at steam I say well it's like a steam bath I'm probably cleaner yes I, feel a bit cleaner yes I was like no, yeah, yeah but no, no, it's a doorway screw that doorway to the next finer set the underlying finer set is what a lot of people don't do they stop at a place of balance or Harmony if you've been nervous and you hit a certain level through a basic practice of calmness whoa you think that's great and it is it is I'm not bitching at you about that my would be don't stop there oh enjoy it for a while once a while I don't know but not 10 years for God's sakes okay uh enjoy it and then it's a doorway let's move into the whole next set the whole dimensional next and be prepared in the whole going through that doorway opening to the next dimensional sense that it's juicier it has more energy be prepared to be open to that so it doesn't push you out of that level back to a lesser level so these repeating tricks easy the eye for quite a while more room more room and more room any sense of deeper to include the experiential energies not just doing all of this in the upper half it'll work that way but you're going to miss so much it's going to in the big picture it won't work you'll get, grown up grown up because it's a fullness it's a fullness so this deeper experiential sense of the energies is critical not just the idea about it yes that's the library we presented that as an idea we diagram it as an idea yes now there's a laboratory we begin to spun around with it then having some experiences in the laboratory you continue deeper finer energies experience and we call that the gym the library laboratory gymnasium it's a nice layout I, like it okay I got that from osensei by the way uh I thought it was kind of cute where the hell are we did I did I lose me and lose you where are you where are we okay yeah just jump in on some yeah, right I'm trying to unmute myself here okay um when you started talking about fields of energy you're kind of reflecting on last week and it, and the Harmony and, I immediately went to uh an example with music you know uh you know we think of all right there's the I or the, character in the situation, and we tend to think of them as items as if they're distinct items just as a guitarist playing with say a keyboard player holder right there yeah and that's what I tried to say a few minutes ago when I'm saying you know the Potted Plant Theory I really like that picture I really like that presentation but a little tendency to do what he said here to think of them as items whatever yeah and they're a little bit separate too much the idea of it's kind of nice so yeah a plant in a nice pot and, a healthier plant and a better place oh yes, okay so yes go ahead so you so when you started talking about, them instead as fields of energy I can see those fields, of energy I can see those fields the energy just kind of mixing and, blending uh just like with music yes there's a guitarist yes with that diagram was meant to do I know it's not a great diagram but the mix these are going that away and these are coming this way and they're all going through each other yeah, yeah uh the outcome is always use pictures of a couple the royal couple I guess in, in, in a big four pests or posted bed I possibly they're referring to that real good blending Harmony thing okay I don't speak Alchemist tone that well but I've Got a Feeling for it and, there's sort of that fullness there's holding hand there's dating uh there's more relating and then kabane kapow the sharing, and because of that sharing a new being is bread is produced anyway enough Alchemy lesson for tonight go ahead Steve sorry I think that's you know there is a I guess the when he started talking about that and I immediately went to music and the idea of Harmony you know you listen to Great Piece Of Music yes you can pull out the, different uh instruments but, those instruments but, those instruments are what they're creating is something beyond that um so that blend becomes something more than, just the individual items so to speak let me jump in again yeah knowing I don't know anything about music I'll do my best here okay the Muse the musician as music he's playing okay situation music that's being played musician the centered character and usually at first there's a bit of discrepancy or disharmony between the two right basic [Music], okay, better level of character better sense of the circular music and they start to harmonize better he's playing things better gaps that existed when he was a beginner don't exist here at this level there's something better there whatever you guys in music would call that okay following week finer level of these two fields of energy the musician and the music isn't there a very advanced level where you can't tell the difference I don't know how to say this but the, musician is the music and the music is the is the musician where there's something almost magical right there it's like holy was he playing the music or was the music playing in I couldn't tell oh wow you must have a phrase for that very advanced level having to focus what it is because it's out of my field did you follow that okay answer yeah and also well it reminded me also because I was talking uh earlier today with Autumn about actors in scenes and when, you when it's really going and what's really happening, there is no actor doing a scene there is there is no actor doing a scene there is that whole experience which is one yeah, uh could we say it say here but it really looks real it's not what you nobody was acting something this, reality was happening on stage right in front of me on the screen wow uh it wasn't somebody acting it was like oh my God I don't know what to say there they're perfect for the role is one way some people might say it at a, level approaching this level that we're talking about or they disappear into the role ah or like uh some of you know uh Nick Scoggins passed away now Aikido teacher a friend of mine uh, actor and uh I went to see one of his shows playing Dracula in San Jose and so it went out for the halftime break there and some ladies said wow he doesn't even need makeup he was so perfect there for the role that kind of thing and there's a piece of it there you just fit right into it we're doing the best we can here talking about this oh boy oh boy yeah but anyway again what's nice is this is based on a law this harmony between this and that and that and this it's, trying to happen and often when it's trying to happen you don't know how things work it's a you're being agitated by that that's natural that's trying to happen that's why I think it's so important for people to understand it's energy okay it's key it's she it's energy okay uh you remember that one TJ oh yeah it could have been uh um a, great broadway play or I, started it that way yes you did uh when I was in writing mode I did a lot of stuff my car got broken into in San Francisco of course and all my notes were handwritten notes because I don't I'm not a computer type especially then and all my notes had oh Briefcase full of notes for different story ideas and stuff and it got stolen and I said I just didn't want to go back and redo stuff and anyway but that, was the uh, main central line of, of the musical anyway, out the door where the hell are we oh okay the naturalness of Harmony trying to happen okay but if you're too scrunched up in whatever in harmony is trying to happen and start trying to happen through you around you and you don't know that you know what's going on over there subtle easy the eye because tie-dye will Panic here not be able to read things allow things take the benefit and flex with the benefit of those things for the practice of it all right so your Basics easy settle open give everything more room okay knowing there's a lot of energy is moving around easy double check your opening recognize if you're being pushed I would double check my settled opening right there okay so all your simple Basics are that's why I'm repeating them again because they're so damned important all along the way let's say you get pretty fancy advance and we're in the domain and you came in on a self and character and suddenly domain, whoa pretty good pretty good having a nice experience let's say and suddenly the design of creation wants a turn it's suddenly boom taking a center stage there its energy Vibe is different than the other three that might wiggle you a bit hey but you said oh okay something else you're showing easier to be open give it time to show itself give it time to label itself tricks at the trade that are pretty, ongoing pretty ongoing so it's worth going back over them and reminding ourselves re-experiencing them okay because this won't be your first or last easy the eye this won't be your, first or last there is more energy here how do I know if it's something's changing therefore there's more or a different kind of energy it's going to come into play I have to understand it no you don't stop it with that don't go there easy give it time more room if it's space Don't Panic easy double check and, it will clarify itself Basics, very important Basics that repeat, okay, so you go from an eye to a self dolphin's much juicier than a good A B one Whatever let's call that one, okay one the proper character I don't have a word right there for that okay uh so we're calling it one and then the next piece is underlying it is to the self okay right there as you start to the beginnings of crossing a border could I say into the land of domain where the self it's pretty, big time not the only big time there but hey a main piece the main one of the four he's a biggie okay he she is it's a biggie okay you gotta just figure there's gonna be more energy there beat prepare to open and open some more because it's juicy over and over again these are important basics uh what else thank you sir with anything himself anyway I like getting you over I like the flavor of two fields of energy I like what Steve said where they seem to be able to fluff through each other better, okay, uh I think I was talking to my nephew who's a musician and I think I mentioned this to him uh talking about uh okay, character using it a piano player piano as a reference that I, think I suggested to him that uh that there's a potentially a level there where you won't be able to tell yourself apart from the piano and said I'm playing the piano uh yeah of course and there's levels and levels and levels but there might be a level where in a certain way you can't distinguish the piano being played and the player the player they start to like blend a certain way I'm sure a lot of people have, had that, momentary feeling and different things I'm sure a batter hitting a good ball or something had that moment of I don't know I didn't hit the ball that got hit or something yeah ah [Music], am I diverging too far help, me a quiz since it is Tisha one of the ways we we've talked about it and you've also mentioned it is being in the zone, Zone it's not you can't think your way into it just like you can't think your way into self and kind of a contradiction in an interesting way yeah let me jump in again for a second please but we might present a word in the zone as the idea of it or the library of it that's what we call the library let me hey you're a young baseball player uh here I see some potential in you but I want to try to help you get in the zone, and I explain a little bit like what the zone is I gave them Library stuff now he's got to settle down have more feeling get down to a better level finer feeling and, maybe he'll start to feel the Zone certain ways okay the zone is an experience it's not I mean if we're using it as an idea but it is an experience yes and actually I want to re reiterate that a lot of people are very good at memorizing words they're better than me uh and they think if they understand the concept they got it I'm sorry people I'm sorry I'm sorry that's nice you're so brilliant that way but that's more Library that's good we gotta start someplace often we start with an idea or somebody presents a concept to us or we read something that Catches Us ah I know if you're interested you that thing caught me the other day let me sit with that let me begin to feel that yeah, that's where I did a lot of my work someone catch my attention and I'd sit with it on it and do this kind of stuff yeah, so, idea Library playing around Laboratory and there's some experience there but not the fullness yet deeper finer dimension now the truer gymnasium the Fuller experience of it so yeah I cut you off though Keisha go ahead no that was it that's really essentially it that we're distinguishing we're using Concepts in talking about the Zone we're talking even talking about the self but what that is, the finger pointing to the Moon to uh Bruce Lee in no way uh yes we're looking we're looking for the um for that direct experience the experiential piece of this yeah so that's, really what I want to do since it was hot and heavy on that because it's, the fullness of experience is really been I don't say mainly missed but heavily percentage-wise heavily missed we highly value intellect you know I mean, how many phds would you have if, your time on the mat was counted towards you know a PhD right my, take on that one was God if I had taken up tennis look where I'd be now I'd be the tennis pro and me and, excuse me the young ladies wanting to learn tennis there we'd be together yes ah at the Country Club Look at me now I could have been somebody Charlie instead of an Aikido teacher which is what I am what I am what movie could have been a content on the waterfront, I could have been a contender couldn't you damn uh people I smell my dinner cooking away there uh so any last, things anything I know I ramble around a bit but, following this easy the eye soon will get a major pass through here and when you're starting if the self is starting to show you're probably at that doorway there you've done pretty good with, your Basics Bobby Robert Nado see I don't think Bobby can really make a good touch on self it could happen rarely but not really Robert maybe, there'll be something Nado should be so more subtle more squared away Basics are down pretty good if not then, who is that Nado, should continue and do the next set to be Sensei finer dimensional deeper more experienced and there it should show we're not going to continue on this we call this Linear by the way uh continue finer and find out your Sensei now you're the great Sensei eventually maybe you'll be at a like in sales since that's a different meaning here but uh and on and on and on uh what we're trying to do here now should lay this out clearer is to get enough to do this to do this quicker potentially that doesn't mean you just think about it for a moment you got it I don't mean that quicker but, cut to the chase I think of it uh that with enough level one level two level three uh you have a chance in that opening doorway there to touch self, to then move from this world into the world of domain which is getting pretty fancy and in a world of domain the other main pieces will show and you get to experience those getting really cool here that will bring us to whatever's next so potential I don't call it as uh they're real catching on of my God it is sheer and it's not really that far away yeah it is some I have to do here whatever, whatever uh just to line me up and then through that I'll try to say that better and lay that out better another day but you get the flavor yeah thank you so much Sensei thank you thank you and again to remind anybody came in late uh yes we're taking donations, and next week my birthday and Elaine's birthday we're taking option she's going to dinner and I'm going to dinner and you have a vacation next Friday more on some of this stuff play with some of this stuff they had experiencing play in the gymnasium also okay thank you thank you Sensei thank you happy birthday thank you happy birthday for next Friday thank you Lauren happy birthday Bob thank you everyone good night good night

yes thank you too many too soon why i have trouble remembering my how old i am i like 33 when i was 33 i just took a liking at 33 and i was 33 for quite a few years it confused me as to how old i am so anyway, hi how are you people let us know how old you are but we won't tell you what i said some of us know how old you are but we won't tell you oh i, think around 85 now it's, been, thrown out this sounds right yeah well just remember that if you add those two numbers together you're, just 13. okay hi everybody uh before we get going uh carry over from whenever or from last week anything, observations questions insights ah the mic is yours i can't tell who wants to speak because about 30 people have their microphones open, so somebody has to step up and speak uh sensei bob here uh one thing i thought was, very good last week was referring to the energies as nutrients yeah are you saying you like that change of words yes yeah me too let's talk about that for a minute, um energies uh but then some people can do weird things with energies what if i don't like that energy and oh would that energy harm me or something uh is a possibility uh and, kami god knows what people do with that i, kind of when i use the word kami i kind of imagine a lot of people have butterflies and they call them commie and they can sit back and say let the kami do it i like schmooze if you're old enough you remember schmooze, a bunch of little things floating around there, happy and loving and if you were hungry the shmoo would go oh i need to like turn himself inside out and become a hamburger, and there you could eat the hamburger and so that was al cap's little abner schmooze brilliant, in retrospect the guy had it anyway, uh so uh, so uh whatever and be prepared to change words sometimes gives you a different flavor so again with the uh addition of that word nutrients i kind of find it is benign the right word it's nice, it's nutrients, ah sit settle soak open to nutrients i kind of like the flavor there don't get too cute on me though about well let's see do i have is there enough calcium there or potassium then don't go cute on me keep it simple nutrients whatever nutrients, whatever nutrients ah they're life-giving whatever keep it keep things simple one reason might start to get too cute is to stay away from the actual experience of the deeper under energies and that's your way of staying away from it oh all you're doing then was we'll study potassium and then we'll, do it as like where you're going why are you doing that what are you running from is where i'm going here okay so keep things simple uh close enough good enough right there anyway thank you bob on that anybody uh something it's not sensei linda esken not in particular about last week but, about my last week i have been putting all of this to work moment by moment um and it's been a really important tool for me right now i'm working on a lot of things that are that i'm feeling sort of pressured and uh you know a little overwhelmed with and i've been you know stopping settling opening looking at what's going on and, really putting this work to as much use as i can yeah so what practicing, uh reminding yourself more often during the day the day to practice you can't go wrong you can't go wrong even though they're, at first simple ones you can't go wrong because you're establishing that pattern okay uh, we okay to move on people yeah nothing not on zilch okay, uh what that was the write-up tonight hang on a second actualizing circle center okay where are we going with that uh we present pictures we present ideas but very important to experience should be a better word there but experience, actual, okay to actualize it well since i tried to get that across with put it in your body, maybe a bad choice of words because i, tried putting it in my body it's like this is not working anything this deeper inner self body dimensional finer cells body uh put it in here uh in here okay, which brings us i see the potted plant here uh a potted plant was is, a damn good example but anyway let's, start simple um and i think with what we're going to play with we'll uh explain the write-up actualizing data okay let's start with the first basic center uh we'll do this standing yeah okay, if i can so one of my early presentations was being centered early presentation being 19 uh center yeah i understand center a bit what are we going to do with the center okay, here, here, checking my feet on the ground feeling my feeling my body see if the body is feeling here as opposed to knowing i'm here what you talking about yes that's the idea of it now the beginnings of experience of it i feel a bit of settling down through the system i notice the breathing pattern is changing just tells me i'm beginning to settle here better out there i'm trying to feel a little beat there okay a little early in the game but okay that i can sense feel a beat sense of beat i don't know if i can feel again sense feel you may notice it with your breath inhale and an exhale or whatever you guys are doing there's a beat there okay, now basic centering we're working center, and there are energies i don't go to the idea now energies and, i play the game they start from under and they flow up through the system energies go up through the system and, partner re-beats back down checking my stableness my feet stability okay from a little bit deeper a little bit deeper energies flow up through the system being reached a certain level i'm saying this is about my level right now pretty good and from there boom respond back down energies up through the system energy's down through the system against an inner sense i'll be looking out there for the energies here, little inner finer sensing energies flow huh energy energies flows down ah okay uh, this move happened uh as the energies move up and down they begin at first they take a male female kind of thing form you've touched on that before we've touched on that before when i've asked you which one for you is male which one is the female okay, and we've gone a little further with that uh we won't do it tonight i'm just reading my video uh that at first they could be bitching at it at each other if they're, kind of bitching at each other but i should settle open fire level of energy up finer energy a little down they begin to be more okay with each other, so they were bitching at each other uh if she said to him you're too harsh and he says but you don't get anything accomplished uh in a tight space yeah it seems like they are bitching at each other, settling opening as those energies can flow freer i call this the dating game at first they meet first meet in a coffee shop they're checking each other out they're not sure about each other but then after a while just hanging out ah, they begin to they hold hands they share dinner as they continue to hang out uh they get friendly very friendly with each other that's why i call this the dating game that, as you easy and settle and open the energies up and down he and she of them ah have a better relationship and like parents better relationship hopefully produces a breeze mixes a better kid so because of that issue flavor uh there's the breeding capability so i call it mixing or breathing probably another word or two i forget right now ah so in the center energies, down take a moment for the mixed bean bread feel yourself who are you and if you're well i'm the guy who's okay with up and down i'm not quite that's the energy beats who are you there was a mix there was a breeding this word that you come up with who are you and you feel yourself i'm starting to feel a little stronger brad, i feel fuller here fuller as these energies up and down mix or breathe hey i'm kind of a grounded guy now this is me and i have sort of a masculine macho first approach so your sense of yourself could be different so you're free to have your own words here about you okay, i feel like oh more protective of my children or things so whatever your feelings i'm just giving you my form and that first time physical much okay you don't have to be that but you do have to feel who are you and who are you okay so i'm stronger i'm more definitely here okay and what else and what i can support things a bit uh, atlas with the world on the shoulders kind of thing i don't think i could carry the whole world right now but i could i could carry a load not physically, responsibility i could i could carry more responsibility ah forget the fullness of yourself the character mixing and mixing who are you who are you feel yourself after a while you feel yourself and then we can get into what's your viewpoint of the world but i don't want you at first to, go from this mix and then let me think about who i am the better you feel trick of the trade better just feel, and then you'll begin to feel your awareness your philosophy, your viewpoint of the world at this level, okay, and one more brad what i feel balanced yeah he looks balanced physically nervous energies around him yeah, yeah it's okay, let's take a pause [Music] there that was the probably close to the original that i presented way back when okay, uh a lot of folks got a lot out of it we used to do that a lot i remember one of the first good stories a guy who's a skier and i'm starting to do aikido ski season was there he went skiing and he came back and said wow was it different because i'm more centered wow now you've been skating for years, but suddenly with more center, skiing he said wow we're different yes better center better character better character sphere okay so whatever the job is whatever the circumstances are can't go wrong with being better centered, so that was the first simple, introduction okay where are we here yes well sensei this is lauren yes sir and uh turn my camera on sorry so when i do this process this that i've seen you do and done with you in classes for years sometimes the energy wants to go up and down as you described it, but sometimes it also wants to go out and in and in yes you're a circle type i'll get into that in a moment but continue please so, over the years i've like enjoyed doing both i, find them both you know but yeah i would say i'm more drawn to the out, in motion in motion and so and so is it just uh some people are yes, that's next lauren that's next oh well okay so but thank you for the warm up on that i'll try to explain it it's a genuine question so yeah no that's why it's here for everybody it's important yeah i'll turn it back to you remember i was like i like center i'm, a center first major okay i mentioned historically oh sensei was a center first major and, and, he was aware a bit of the circle and aware of self you know uh but he majored in his early, years earlier years being centered being centered, okay, he knew he was missing something though but he developed really, cool okay uh he was using a lot for a strong body that does martial arts so you've got physically strong right look at the old pictures okay, uh this is the story of him as a little kid on the beach and suddenly the sick kid in town he's top, of the group what a shock to everybody because they knew he was sick sickly but he caught on to this pretty fast pretty early developed fast okay uh but eventually which i follow through this uh eventually uh, center was very good uh that's uh, after uh takeda, the jujitsu teacher who was very good here, uh, and he started to get the fuller of it she said hey that's really cool then there's something missing that's when he goes to the gucci omoto kill the gucci uh very advanced got the whole thing down but, presents the circle part, two of sensei and uh did it i guess in kind of fun wild ways because those sensei said uh he shook my cage just showing how the circle works shukle sensei's cage he was sort of aware of it but uh the gucci being much more advanced boom, boom and, then since they needed that part okay, uh and then he uh when he left he played with that it's not just he learned it from, the gucci he's got it he had to experience it really experience it okay and he said uh in the early stages there people were starting to refer to him as o sensei he said he wouldn't accept that, title he hadn't quite gotten the center circle, center pattern full enough he wouldn't buy that title when he got we'll get into it soon the center to the circle the circle to the center pattern uh and fully experiential in the fine dimension he was at he said okay oh sensei oh sensei but they tried to throw that title at him and he wouldn't buy it i'm not quite there yet okay anyway his little historical knowledge within what you will okay where the hell are we somebody got something just well sensei if i just draw on the history, which, you know you know that transform that transformation that o sensei must have gone through from takeda to de gucci uh when he lived in ayabe with taguchi he had a small dojo and he was uh practicing all the time i've read like just day and night as well as farming and hanging out with you know uh unesablo de gucci himself and being part of the community but he, had his you know when, part of his experience was i've read is he was trying to figure out you know what was missing in the thing he was doing while he was there with de gucci and he was, actively daily on the mat yeah no okay, yeah i'm going to dialogue with you another time, okay yes training but inner, inner, how does this inner activity this uh center i am and now the gucci presented more circle let me get, i was aware of it but boom the gucci sense i said whoa more or something now he's trying to assemble that and it's then because of that inner work checking out his outer techniques inner work checking out his outer it's not the outer is going to bring him to the inner it's all i'm trying to say here, yes, yeah, inner to the outer as a quick reference or if you're having trouble with the technique or some ensemble of group attack or something uh can you can't quite you go in there and say hey who do i have to be inner what's the inner assembly that is okay with that inner to the outer inner to the outer inner to the outer more answers on the inner outer is just like a reference but what happens with people is they take their reference and major in the reference and talk about the inner but they're not inner there's no inner being experience they talk about it pay lip service inner actual experience powder so something i like, that is that okay for now yes thank you yeah huh somebody something, you need to pause, hello i sense it's mike from new zealand yes so would you say therefore that inner to outer is clearly um sorry i might interrupt you but somehow we don't see you mike your camera is blocked can you just sound a bit for me okay i apologize i, look rather than um trying to fix that right now because i think it'll just mess things around but we can hear you though so i'm just going to say so therefore would it be um would you agree that, the general, way aikido has actually been practiced is from the outer ingredient see right there i have to be socially correct i have to be polite uh i hint at damnation for the way aikido is going but i can't overdo it so i don't want to head into that, unfortunately but following what you're saying, unfortunately uh there seems to be a tendency for more outward, and not a real inner experience dimensional level of being you know okay again love is paid lip service too but it's not actually experienced and major again uh yeah sorry i also wasn't trying to present uh going um inner to outer as being the right way and therefore we're you know we're better than them but mainly the observation that that's what actually seems to have happened out there that the out is where the emphasis has been and yes along the way a lot of the more senior people have developed a sense of the inner now here degrees, degrees that's where you got to be careful degrees what degree of inertia there are many dimensions yeah so i don't really just throw out a blanket statement at all he's a high rank he really he's got a fantastic dinner no, no i am saying though that some individuals will have picked up on the inn and often subconsciously in other words there is a bit of the inner coming out in what they do but they don't even notice that it's there well that then would bring a question to my mind uh that on call they can't notice it's there and how it operates it's some accident i, admit defeating trying to come up with the language yeah so establish a language one day okay we better okay thank you yeah okay, uh center to circle again standing now we did uh one session i don't think the chanting carries well but to remind you what we did we did a, center and yet the fracking words radiates out to the circle enhancing boom goes out better because it's been enhanced it goes out better we did the ah, to the o and o to the ah whatever it's comfortable for you uh okay those are just two example sounds okay, okay but let's stay with that basic center to the circle okay better the center it, radiates out flows out whatever the electrical words are true it touches the, circle okay, the circle feels it and responds back to the center uh what's our word tonight our nutrients actualized, yeah so we're going to head towards more uh, actualizing okay, maybe we should throw the potted plant in here because that's a beautiful example the center character, plant, okay center character plant in the world that's in the realm it's in, relation another word we give the circle is the warehouse, of stuff okay so the center says hey and just like our delivery system sees hey i want whatever and the warehouse says okay boom and they ship it to you and there it is for you to utilize okay, all right center to the circle, to the center, okay let's see i'm trying to figure out uh of lauren's question it's one to bring that in here later okay now more the actualize let's use the potted plant form because i think it's a little easier to explain maybe make it easier to experience, the plant let's say it's a little bit lacking see i'm starting to droop a bit okay, the plant the plant calls out to the circle hey i'm not feeling well or whatever the circle the circle being the soil the nutrients comes back now to actualize reason roots are important base roots is figured they, gather here and then up and down through the center character plant boom the plant gets uplifted the plant gets recharged the plant gets healthier and we're going to overlay this uh am i jumping the gun here with we touched on a possibility for healing using this pattern keep that in mind here the plant says [Music] properly done messages to the circle, response dirt nutrients up and down the plant so this character is a healthier character the plant is a healthier plant ah okay so um instead of just acknowledging center of the circle and circle the center i wanted to add that a little bit about the roots where it's an opening to the plant and the root is where the nutrients gather, that go up through the plant mixing up a stronger plant creating a stronger plant a handsomer plant a nicer plant a smarter plant or more loving but whatever, whatever it's a warehouse for everything, it depends what your lineage is okay, yeah is that okay yeah do we stay on that one and get a reminder here show these things i do them for a minute but that's not good enough i expect i hope, i plead i plead that it just catches your attention that you play with it 15 minutes a half an hour that you play with it okay actualize it okay getting let's little lost we're going to go into what lauren was talking about here oh let's just, open mike anybody anything on this anyway you can see why hopefully why i like the potted plant as a presentation form because it's a simple way of seeing experiencing uh the center circle laws that exist throughout the entirety of creation i know we're starting at a small level here but we can quickly move into finer level finer level finer level and it continues no comments anything shock me shock me i'll say something sensei it's dusty i just feel better after that exercise i just feel more alive and yeah joyful so that was one minute what's 15 minutes worth i don't know you play yeah you play not an idea some, sense of experiencing okay, so i don't know you double check you say uh would you say joy is that the word you use doesn't it yeah i don't know joy but um, vibrant uh vibrant uh that, so to stay with that not just oh yes the word to stay with it and to feel vibrantly joyful and joyfully vibrant okay to actually feel it so after a while somebody had to walk in the room and say whoa are you having a good day just because you're vibing you're glowing a certain way, yeah, yes, do you have a ques what connects the circle and the center what's that weaving that's a law that's how it was laid out in the beginnings of creation it laid it out in that form and maybe it did a spiraling form but that's a good basic if i settle easy the eye and clear how those beats work will show not just awareness show but can show experientially which is what we're doing right now you got just a little taste of it wow it was kind of interestingly cool at this first virtually this first level holy, what's it going to be like finer and finer dimensions following this pattern okay, and don't drop it along the way because it goes the distance very fine very original very, very okay that's not a temporary oh wow now i'm going to move on to something else this is an ongoing one this is major okay, anyway i like those very original i like that thank you happy birthday thank you i think ah okay uh so lauren was talking about preferences okay let's break let's break you all up the mankind people kind whatever they're calling it these days uh into three styles for like a word i'm a center first type okay oh sensei was a center first type jack wada is a circle first type lauren's a circle first type okay teaser seems to like this feeling of balance as is first okay i as a center type and now more and more catching up to the circle nutrient, and getting more comfortable with that how those two help each other i call out it responds making a better character plant uh and just getting a better flavor for how it works so i'm catching up on the circle part okay uh, you following me so far kinda yes, yes, the circle types anytime you have a circle you automatically have a character there a center, okay, their weakness well let's go back to weakness my weakness as a center type as many of you know i'm not that social or i wasn't that social that's the circle being social who with myself and whatever, and yeah i had a few friends and whatever but uh socially not i wasn't quite a misfit but questionable are you following me yes okay, ah now the circular types weakness is uh, they don't realize the [Music], bigness of center they have a center and if they're pretty good they're present centered but they don't have a center that's what kind of uh asks kratchet that not to make it full bore uh because there'll be a and even that may be too big for a lot of the circle types at first, so a circle type has a center but often doesn't catch the fullness of the all right so, those two forms nobody has an edge they both have good and things to clean up things to improve the balance types their weakness that's a oh since i like that diagram uh one day i'll have to fine-tune it with him to double check but uh i think he was saying here better the center then that should be equal okay, and when you get some kind of equality or balance or balance it naturally can move better to the next finer dimension at which time we make that line a bit bigger and this line a bit bigger they stay in balance especially if you're there properly to facilitate their imbalance okay uh so where am i going with that oh god it's, a it's a interesting form too i don't know file away that the balance of things so uh if you overdo one if you overdo the circular type you're off balanced if you overdo the center type uh you can get off balance okay it took oh sensei more than a day or a week he was on that catching on to the fullness of the circle uh it was a little strange for him it was for him it was very feminine okay and inherent things like oh no that's weaker that can't be right i'm such a warrior uh and, stuff it wasn't an overnight oh yeah i got it you have to hang with that experience how it works let it unfold okay, uh so for those people think yeah oh you just oh yeah i understand i got it oh i'm sorry it's slower but you gotta experience you gotta i'm sorry it'd be great to say oh yeah i got it now i'm in heaven, and it ain't damn well gonna work that way, but i have a good picture of what heaven looks like looks like i'm telling you ain't going to get there with that you're missing too much there has to be pushing okay i think i got lost here uh and oh uh the balance types a teacher's not on tonight is he didn't see him yes he is done okay uh, t-shirt we talked about this for a moment because it's your style the tendency because your, balance is kind of natural at that whatever level you're starting with that you're balanced therefore you're superior, to all the other guys in the neighborhood there's the weakness yeah oh i'm superior and we say to that person not change of course but to that person yeah but what's next with your balance what's the next inner finer dimension of balance and a lot of those people are afraid to make that move because they're afraid well we're going to lose this balance and i'm the best guy in the neighborhood i'm top dog in the dojo hey and so they're a little leery of letting go of it because it'll seem like it's disappearing it might be lost for a moment whatever but there it is again at a finer dimensional level and then it goes on and on and on like that but that but early in the game they don't know that so that's their weakness they're, superior yeah it's also complacency then too to a certain amount yeah you become complacent because hey the hey things are relatively balanced why, leave a good thing you know one of those guys who i need a job boom there it is for them boom they're bringing their big books hey he said i'm bored with this one i need a job boom there's a job boom they're playing no more hey [Music], at that level he's got a maid he's cool he's successful but finer and finer and finer, yeah questionable yeah so evolution for uh for all, three types the, essential balance type the center circle the circle center they each have their potentials their, benefits yeah and they also have their challenges i think that's what you're saying yeah that [Music] no one's got in a certain way no style has an edge on the other so i've got no complaints with circle people might take me longer to understand them if i'm a heavy duty center, but if they're interested in progression uh they can do it from the center to the circle, and i just give that reminder uh you're gonna have to really double up on the center seal since they have to double up on the circle uh to really get comfortable it wasn't overnight it was years, yeah early, iwama early i remember pre-war time if we could really get that really get that at that point he said now i'll accept the title of sensei, but he wouldn't accept it before that although people tried to throw down he wouldn't buy it because he knew he wasn't quite boom quite centered circled circle centered yeah, would you say sensei would you say that the, the center energy kind of called him because it was really it was missing he had a lot of power from the centering but not from what i meant was the circle the circle really called him um circle energies circled nutrients as we're yeah okay he told me of course it's there while you're centering of course there's some circle activating, i don't know what words he said let's say he was vaguely aware of them but didn't realize the boom of them and that's where the gucci came in yeah so oh sensei like knowing, there was more and he wasn't quite catching it he purposefully remember this is a story where his father's dying but he gets off the train or whatever to go see the gucci and they said well how could he do that doesn't he love his father or something what about father respect this is the orient oh no this calling of hey i'm missing something in the sense that, guy that guy maybe you can help me kind of thing so yes there's a uh it shows itself see what there's specifically there but if you're used to being a center you may not notice the signs of the circle okay oh i thought something uh magician dennis are you on i just thought he got a gig no sensei he is not on tonight i'll tell a story anyway i was talking to him to him and something about uh that fits in here his daughter who right now represents a circle said some uh daddy you were brought up different than we were i mean her and her brother whoever uh things are different okay so i think we talked to me and dennis about a little better center to be more aware of the circle to be in tune with the kids, in this age in this time to be a better family is it's anyway that sort of fits in with what i'm trying to say here i probably garbled the hell out of it though didn't i, don't think it was very garbled at all actually okay yeah ah, okay, so center circle, center uh more advanced more advanced more advanced the center to i take my time here and i don't know say center to the circle, is feeling whatever the center said to it and, boom it's responding now what i'm clarifying tonight was a trick of the trade here uh is it's responding especially at the base roots so the plant being open at the root being deeper so the more better soil nutrients can be there, can intake more of those nutrients up and down for a bit to be a healthier handsome or whatever plant so i think that was the newest addition the, bringing up the roots and uh and more intaking sometimes it's worded like if you're this the energies uh spiral around, and i sort of don't like that way of saying it because they'll be too much aware of things spiraling around instead of the intaking the nourishment the slurpy effect that whatever you want to call that words internal, boom, there's something deep inside boom so that was the, the highlight tonight i think for me anyway uh roots mentioned before there's a unfortunately in the not just human condition but bigger than that, a little fear of quote the underworld of and when it shows this dark which freight off usually it does it's dark boom uh that beings not just people it continues on unfortunately for a while have an aversion they don't understand it and they kind of pull away from it okay for a simple example would be if you ask somebody to settle to sit with themselves settle, a lot of people can't do that they [Laughter] you know what i mean they said that what about and what about and, oh is that related to you and, and they're trying to stay away from this under stuff what i'm asking you to do also with this deeper root energies may not quite do it for some people the word commies may not do it for some people uh this, what's our word nutrients a little more it's nutrients easy, it's, it'll take care of you mr plant don't panic it's nutrients at first you may not see it you may think but no there's worms yeah but even the worms go a little deeper the worms are leaving nutrients they have a word for worm don't they, it's very good for the soil drop, inside so your first look your first take is usually so i like the word nutrients i thought that oh yeah just sit settle so deeper into the nutrients easy finer dimension the nutrients begin to show they're, sure colors you see at a heavier level it's a cow crab whatsoever cup crap i need a new zealander here what's your question manure, it's manure but as you settle easy what is it really finer dimension what is it not intellectual now you got to sit on this oh yeah i know it's, a fertilizer that's your now you're gonna dial out fertilizer forever that's your cop-out for sitting and soaking and opening you got me this is important we have a basic fear of quote the underworld, so i like the sense of it's dirt but it's fertilizer finer sense of it so the, uh, uh shitty word again manure, so it could look like manure and smell like manure okay but as you go inner finer what is that really and eventually they'll show us fertilizer and you continue inner finer what is it really, and it's life-giving it's nourishing giving, and continue finer and finer so it's simple but you've got to sit in it, you've got to sit in it okay, and yeah you're allowed to read stories and books and stuff but make sure it's not like to the point where it's your cop out from not sitting on it did i say that brad do you like that no you give me a thumbs up or no on that yeah okay so basic center just not alone or for me i'm a center type but for anybody fun basic fun, fun uh then oh it's kind of like in your development i, i, it's like a double up law you get up and down and one is male or one is female whatever, and you get an enhancement but eventually when this gets big enough suddenly it points out hey there's a circle here also at which point it centered you not sure what to make of it okay it's, it's, okay it's natural but it's like double up the male female of the center sort of double up and announced a male female of circle center, circle so always be prepared for a, double up if you think you got the whole thing but you continue double checking opening allowing it may it may double up on you and show you it's twice as big you had a first piece very good but it's this big okay so do be prepared for a, double up i don't know a better phrases when i made up double up where the bigger of it will show and it may confuse the smaller we said ah i got my package yeah but continue finer and finer to double check okay another trick of the trade oh what, what i don't know i've covered a fair amount let's, what, where are you stuck where, are you stuck where sensei just complete the thought are you are you saying that as you this up and down centering center, center will, breed a circle oh no, no, no, you breed your character you breed the plant but eventually the circle is there all along the way it's been there but not maybe showing as fully as it really is yeah so no you don't create a circle see the center is already there i'm just getting, i'm getting in the groove of center i don't create a center there's a center here often tried to teach it that way some people may remember we stepped into the center that's already there kind of thing now i'm going to create it, was created a long time ago by uh what's his name forget i've heard said that before in the old days you missed the joke there now okay now you create a better character huh, were you meaning god don't, bring up names here uh yeah so no this breeds a better character but in so doing potentially the circle uh situation around it is improving, he may or may not notice okay, or he may notice it a bit but not get the fullness of the circle i got it at one level it's a universal warehouse all nutrients are available depending on what kind of plant you are full bore okay but, this is the, centered character plant okay and the circle is there but you may or may be sort of aware of it but eh you know you know but as you continue uh someplace if you're good enough with this it's gonna say hey and you're gonna go what the hell is that okay or if you're good enough with this someplace it's gonna say hey what the hell is that okay so it may startle you in a certain way or bump you okay and you won't know why you're getting bumped out of your center tails happening here i was so centered the other day i was really getting cool i was coolly centered and suddenly getting bumped could be the circle saying hey i'm here pay attention i've been here but you haven't noticed me hey, sensei sean here i, i, just thought of this great analogy when you're talking about all this and instead of potted plant how about a redwood you know california redwood you know california redwood you know they, i don't know how many hundreds of feet they are um yeah but i think since they mentioned that, uh, i was going to uh amy used to pull up sayings from sensei and bring him a class for me and, one day gonna ask her to remind me about the one where he was talking about a big tree a giant tree you stand there but like behind you is a giant tree and i don't remember how well since i said it but looking at that one i can find that one somewhere, if it's no problem yeah i, was i was thinking i was thinking a, more of like a botanist um there's these there are these things okay uh sean just to get on your case stop thinking okay, have you sat in the potted plant in that dirt and opened up to the more of it all right where i'm going sean i'm not saying you're doing this but it's part of the heads up i was trying to give the other people i don't want to sit on this shitty dirty pot so oh what about a tree what about a willow and what about flowers and what about dandelion and stop it sit on this dirty pot let it unveil itself open to it breathe it it's nutrients but you have to experience it's not a idea it's an experience it's an experience that a lot of folks are afraid to experience because it's just underworld and through, time we've tried to get across to you so i presented this the snake pit story to you my i do that on purpose and i bring back the same stories again on purpose i'm sitting there i mean i'm beginning my meditation i'm settling suddenly i feel pink, i can almost physically feel it didn't think that it's simple i see snakes not see them out here in my sensing it's in snakes what the hell i don't, like snakes and they're biting me the first urge i'm going to get out of this sitting mode go check in refrigerator okay, i knew when things were building up for me in a negative sort of way in my settings because i have an urge to go clean the refrigerator let me tell you i never my whole life have urges to clean the refrigerator except certain times when i'm sitting and there's energies in the early days that i didn't know how it worked or wasn't aware they were there but i would get i think i'll go clean a refrigerator then i knew something was up i stayed and sat so what i did with the snakes was open some more damn the next thing is a snake pit who wants to sit in a snake pit i thought it's like an indiana jones movie clip or something i don't like snakes a snake bit oh my god but i know i'm in my meditation space, let's hang out here we'll see what the hell this is all about ah continue i easy settle open easy and the next level i suddenly see these snakes giving me this hey this is the smile and, the, trick the game's afoot okay, and as i continue i'll be fine in front of going dimensionally finer i use those words now uh the spirals weren't snakes they were energy spirals oh that was kind of used to energies or eggs to some degree ah, hey, energy spirals i continued a bit more and there's this beautiful lady and she'd move her arms and when she moved their arms these energy spirals that later and heavier became snakes and heavier were antagonistic towards me okay so you gotta sit in your own snake pit okay, let me aside for a moment bob who's the lady the nun spain back went that i asked you to read saint teresa of avila okay, so bob mentioned to me that uh in her prayer time meditation time sitting time correct me bob yeah that's right that as she was sitting wild animals were like biting at her ta-da hello people she's running through a pattern that i ran through okay now you're a good catholic nun praying to god and you're sitting and settling and opening and suddenly wild animals are biting you but she's cool don't that must be the devil i'm out of here so i asked bob to research see if she laid out her pattern there what she what she did with that so uh, when he has time he'll keep me informed as to her pattern are you following anything i'm saying here so sean yeah you want to do tree do a tree, i'm an old tree hanger out or i spent more than a little bit of time with the tree letting the tree instruct me onto how it works so i could kind of mimic in my system, it's working so yeah fine cool but do be careful of bouncing around with more awareness and more of this and more of that and not actually sit in the which isn't really but don't know that get to the experience actually where it's not and continue finer and finer, okay john you're okay with that sean yes i'd say thank you very much and again not necessarily just for you i'm not pointing your finger at you this is, humankind plus, plus this misunderstanding so i think i might have found the quote you found it i think so um, every sturdy tree that towers over human beings owes its existence to a deeply rooted core thank you yes that's the one um could you put that in the chat for us all it's already there oh thank you uh, yeah i wouldn't mind that you show oh sensei stuff lauren but i wouldn't mind some that are more direct along the lines that i teach i like that one for example um, i'd be happy to work with you or amy and anybody to refresh the sayings well amy's got a story to write you, okay, i'll follow up with you amy thank you so much anyway do we get anything out of this and basics when the situation changes okay for you or aikido people uh you're working with one okay a fairly easy move things are pretty good, okay, and then sensei says okay now two and pick up the pace suddenly there's a little something that goes on there because when the situation changes by law this has to change that's the situation circle to the center activity going on so there's your like early example simple okay and, if the student can't grow, to be equal to two bouquets moving a bit faster then you should tone it down and not just keep burying the guy did you keep burying the guy i don't think he's going to learn too much uh so once you realize you can't cope any further uh then do a lesser form of it or something okay, yeah trying to teach kid baseball he can't keep throwing a fastball 80 mile an hour ball at him he's eight years old he's never going to hit the damn thing who are you helping here i was raising i was with the guard dogs police dogs and stuff uh i always let the puppies win we wrestle and they chew on me a little bit and oh i always let them win when they're young how can i develop them if i beat them down all the time they're not going to even make the attack in the first place even when they're an adult they're going to be oh i'm going in so anyway i must have said something intelligent any, response anything we're eating up our time here finishing up, uh sensei this is bob the films of osensei where he's has like 10 guys attacking him at the same time watch those films he doesn't get frenetic and try to fight with 10 guys he goes deeper and deeper in and you can see the roots and then those roots start to draw those attackers in and if you look at it frame at a time he accomplishes what seems impossible and that is the feet of the attackers from all points in the circle get drawn into the center and then they're down yeah a group second [Applause] and if people try to physically learn how to do that it's a joke they get run over it killed yeah thank you yeah again you have to watch with a certain eye where you can see past the first obvious into finer dimension, okay, that's why in class would often, ask, you the students uh okay you see he's, stepping and doing ekil but what are you seeing well he stepped with his foot and his hand moved yes, yes we got that we got that next level of seeing what are you seeing and then they begin to see other things oh there was a and then he moved in oh you caught the earlier before he moved in and whatever, so, the ability of changing the frequency of your eye is that too heavy way of saying it changing yourself dimensionally and then seeing from that you see you go if you're if you're whatever physical problem patient and you go see elaine or susan uh yeah they see you physically but they're also already going click, click so they can see you at another level, right yeah hawaiian asking for gina yeah hello sensei i'm here just a reminder uh inner finer inner finer character who naturally sees at her level with the sense that, probably uh i don't know radiates out through the energy character you through the physical character you uh and that's where potential healing is inner finer character yeah so the lineage you're playing with is uh the lineage of uh seeing better or one who can see or something yeah, so just a reminder nothing new there thank you i need it where are we people where are we brad anything from urine at least for me tonight i like the balance, um aspect or just once i process on the center one yeah, they talked about doing the up and down center the first one we started with yeah, two things so i really felt just kind of how i changed once i really sat in balance you know the two energies that was the first thing that, was nice and it was just i felt like i was riding on a surfboard even though i'm staying on, the floor yeah but you know i was writing a really cool way that wasn't it was always there but i didn't see it or feel it before well if you're not in that dimension you may not feel it or if you're dense a certain way and you happen to through some lucking out happen to touch that dimension you're kind of dense so you don't notice it's surfboard country yeah, yeah and then just on the center tonight i um well just feeling that relationship between center and circle i feel the circle energies go in my center and then as my center got finer i settled more um just this kind of nice echo within like i don't know kind of hard to describe i really felt all this energy mixing in the center the center yeah, yeah so just try what is the role between the relationship between center and circle and circle and it's got a sense of it tonight that yeah, the more you stay with it'll clarify itself yeah it was a new experience yeah and that's why you can hear them okay can't you yeah and that's why it's not just an idea well i got that idea i'm finished now uh to sit with it to, as he was saying the relationship of circle to the center and how that mixes and anything hang out there soak in that experience hang out in that experience experientially eventually go finer dimensions sensing that, uh so yeah sensei shawn here so when you um i, think when, it occurs to me that there's circle center, circle, center, circle with the up down it's when you say squared away you say there's there you get squared away and then it's like a fourth thing and then, i then i sense that circle but other than that it's i don't get the gradients i don't get the degrees in between you know what i mean it's like i, think i'm following you but let's start again one more time starting with center yes center up down and then at some point there's a um, uh, um greater weight squared away exactly when you say squared away i think horizontal and i start to think like sort of small but getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and it's a sense of uh largesse a sense of dimensionality okay and then uh it's easier for that squared that squared away to be aware of and contact more comfortably with a sphere a circular sphere yeah, uh yeah so i yeah so i it sounds like that in your, case the character center as it gets up and down energies fuller and fuller is a squared away character yeah that's cool no problem yeah, well but that squared away is what creates the circle sphere or whatever you want to call it that spy all those spirals everything else the, for me that's, how it occurs because of the way you've maybe the way you've presented it made the way of re um uh interpreting it but it feels as if um, that, squared awayness allows for more um, yeah again i got no problem with squared away i kind of use that sense often in a sense of being fuller squared away okay yes a circle at the fuller of the character if he's fuller he's a squared away character he's a damn marine squared away so yeah so yeah puller of the character squared away yeah, interchangeable i'm fine no problem for me, yeah good thank you sometimes i don't know i'm trying to think of some of them change the words you we use words but then also in some way maybe sometimes don't get oh god i don't know how to say this sometimes my history and meditation uh i get a lot of uh visuals in the finder dimensions okay and sometimes i get a visual on something that i didn't understand okay even though i was present with it, didn't sort of do with it kind of thing and i'd say okay i, don't understand that, could you give me another example so i'm still staying on the same lineage i'm not changing jobs so to speak but could you give me a little different form here and then it would present a different form, and quite often i couldn't understand the second form either so i continue i still don't quite get it could you give me a third form and then invariably in inevitably whatever the right word is uh the third form would be like the punch line and then i realized what the first line was uh the first presentation was trying to show and the second presentation but the third one was oh that's what it means so but to get locked up i don't understand that and i'll never get anywhere if i don't understand that it's like easy, easy it's intelligence here hey could you clarify that i'm a dummy give me a hand here could you clarify that for me uh someone get too locked in again i didn't lay that out well but something like that i don't get locked in you know uh sean that was what i was trying to say about the breathing he said yeah i know breathing is ancient i i've done my time in the early years with breathing it's cool, but don't but don't give anyone the sense that it's the only way, don't give me the catholic i'm brought up catholics are don't give me that catholic okay we knew all protestants were unfortunately going to hell never me not the liberal dreaming lover i'm older than you i'm talking about the old days when the nuns had thick, leather belts and they used them the old days anyway where the hell are we people finishing up finishing up finishing up are we okay for tonight we are right at eight o'clock sensations uh, last call for anybody's uh yeah dialogue with sensei questions comments i hope it's happy birthday that's happy birthday sensei i think we're going to do it again now that we're all in tune oh no here can you beard sensei i don't have to sit here for it i didn't want to and yeah why not why not appoint a singer someone who thinks oh here's mike one other thing what's mike i was just saying how about appointing one of us who is actually a singer to do it because the uh the garbled noise that comes over because we don't have the fancy comms that, deals with the response time and perhaps even one of the people yeah say again florida amy on question mark no, too bad she does a good job he bugs me every year my phone rings and it's, her singing we're going for volunteers some of those musicians out there it's time for me to get up head towards the wine [Music] thank you tj thank you people good night good job

[Music] hey, there we go okay good evening good evening sensei is this set okay, all right i was going to do a standing practice i might have to try it here because my other camera is off tonight so uh we'll figure something out anyway ah, carryovers, observations insights questions about last week what the hell ever we did last week hello out there were get close to your mind say something for us say something for us for us say something for us wind us up get us going come on well sensei i've been looking at my arrogance, arrogance, huh, okay, i feel like it's my interpretation the phrase you might remember let's see how do you put it, um, don't, move on the first uh first rush of energy yeah first push him yeah for you know you've only told me i don't know seven thousand times maybe it's only 500. i don't know um, but uh but uh i, really found uh that what it led me to, was, uh a discovery of fairly um you might call it like i kept it hidden right, i knew better than to tell people that i knew they were wrong i could patiently listen to them but inside i was hearing them from the from the standpoint of they're wrong but they need to talk about what they need to talk about, what they need to talk about and i really feel like i've been able to make a shift into they're right about something i'm also right about something you know and if we can if i can really hear where they're coming from i can get better i can learn i can develop myself um i don't win as many arguments which is kind of i was brought up that you know someone disagreed with you, win the argument that settles it you're right you know um susan's not on the line but she might he might be able to talk about that experience, uh, but yeah so it's been it's really been an incredible uh, a real change for me um i feel much better and, people you know people i work with, um, report that i don't seem as aloof or you know yeah okay so okay so all right so maybe first trick there is uh in uh in coming together with somebody uh you say you're catching it you're being pushed, okay so far okay and if you're pushing for bang, you come back fast on them and whatever push on them take it over or whatever right because you're being pushed so, what if a little trick there is when you're meeting somebody going into such a situation that there's more of an opening that you don't wait till you're pushing and try to deal with it you can but you're in the middle there uh that's a little more open knowing there's going to be energies, uh, stuff that will help you be better with them so maybe start it a little earlier open okay, instead of the, one more click the guy who's getting who's starting to get pushed a bit but he may not notice it but then he's going to be pushed he's he made that one extra move and there's where he gets pushed so let's do the other way let's settle back and open up and, get into that situation so you're one more click lower or open to that is that is that kind of kind of a simple trick just to start the game going is that sounds like really good advice i'll give it a shot and i'll let you know how it works yeah, it's the right direction because even when i catch myself quickly if the person i'm in conversation with is very sensitive i, have a few and they're like wait what you know what's that and i'm like no, that's me dealing with my own internal thing yeah you know but, people still catch it and you know people who don't talk about it probably catch it too so yeah i think it's uh it's got there's some practice there no we can't unfortunately expect them to know how things work and to be proper with you or me okay uh i know sometimes i get a lot of energy, and it's just for me and me but people near me are like as if i'm angry at them i'm not angry at you i'm just getting a hell of a lot of energy it's me and me but uh i've gotta what cover that better i've gotta ah be bigger earlier with that so it doesn't boom or they take that personal it's not a personal attack i know it may even sound like one or my energies may feel like one or, or something uh, it's not it's not anyway, yep okay somebody, is going here tonight when i hang out a bit with that which we call that addition sign uh we're gonna head that way i hope i think, but before we do anything, anything, come on come on something hello sensei this guy soon i wanted to can you hear me okay yeah soon yes i want to thank you for the continuity work that we did several weeks ago i've been carrying that forward and that's been very helpful in the sense that, i have a habit of wanting to start from scratch, in situations rather than carry over everything i have and energetically i've been doing a better job of skip saying instead of saying how do i start this energetic process for this situation it's all right where what do i carry forward that statement actually kicks in a lot so thank you for that yeah uh you think you're at your smallest could i say in this situation and then you have to start all over again is that is that what you're saying yeah or more a situation comes up and i say well i gotta start my processing here instead of that oh what do i carry over just that simple statement has allowed the previous work to carry through a lot better, yeah one trick there is if we establish a better it's all inner work right a better, inner, setup, okay then when something happens hey click and the better one is there you go quicker uh you don't have to uh clear the same forest and cut down all the debris and stuff each damn time you get kind of hate spiffy at it i'll ask you in training to go through the level so you're well versed on those first few levels to get the pattern because the patterns will just continue and continue finer and finer but we're not saying you got to come back to weird bobby and then okay but i'd like you to know how bobby to robert tanado using my languaging or level one to a level two to a level, one to a level two to a level three, works, if you establish a level three more if you like that form and you establish level three uh that sort of becomes potentially your norm not that you won't drift out of it towards the tube but it's been established a bit better so it's easier to go from a two to a three hey yeah kind of thing so it kind of fits in i think with your question trick of the trade it does i want to thank you for that it's been very helpful yeah and again for those people that might uh also think the other way around and think, why is he starting at this level again i already know that uh really important really get the flavor and double check that it's really the flavor, okay, yeah, uh see when i walk into dojo some uh, if i remember being in a dojo it's been a while uh some uh some days i sort of remember i'm a high rank but i'm not there yet i have to quickly go quickly just like boom to be the proper one on the mat uh it's sort of similar isn't it yeah so anyway uh both use the click at a time to really catch the terrain then you'll get faster at it okay, not as an idea because you've actually gone through the terrain more than once many times as part of your ta-da and that whole series can get very fast okay, but only if you've had the experience then you experience through all of that very fast you clear the decks fast to a finer level okay well since they covered a lot of territory, boom it would be oh sensei now this is going from an old man and he would do it on purpose sometimes watch i, i can't get up i can't walk boom, and suddenly you couldn't push him or if you're trying to push him up the stairs and he went into one of those i'm authentic tight it'd be like this boulder you couldn't push so he played games uh anyway he, enjoyed that it was an attention getter it amused him and it caught our attention what's he doing you know anyway blah, blah somebody something, then say this is justin i really enjoyed um especially in the last session or two um as we had as we had spoken about briefly the rephrasing of these energies as nutrients in a way i like that um that's been helpful for, me anyway but it's been a very useful language to communicate these ideas with other people who um, may, not, energy is kind of vague it could be woo-woo it could be sci-fi like quantum like what are we talking about but nutrients are pretty straightforward um friendlier, to them yeah, make sense um let me jump in for a sec please remember, energies, yes, commie yes if you're older l caps schmoves yes nutrients, yes, lament shows baby same old stuff yeah what word is comfortable for you and then as you hang with it and open to it and allow it to be present and for like a words dialogue itself ah you get better, a sense of it you may come up with your own word i'm sorry go ahead no, that that's exactly on point um it's trying to speak with people using a language that they can assimilate and they can work with um this was this has been for the times anyway as you've said me it'll adapt maybe in other times but for the times this has been a an easy one for, myself and for others to be working with let me jump in one moment so in case people don't know who you are uh he deals with the general public could i say every day okay uh he, uh he, it's part of a clinic a healing clinic a variety of forms of healing i believe uh anyway so all day a variety of people are coming in so he's finding that word uh for the variety of normal people that come in they're not aikidos they're not tai chi masters uh whatever, uh that that's a nice word for them they seem to have a better feeling and sense, for that word okay i just wanted to establish who you were sorry go ahead well said um and it's true that's so it's a it's a healthcare center and there's a variety of people that come through, um, from every walk of life um, you know so it's true they're not they're not training on the mat and in most cases any martial art maybe they've never even heard of aikido for that matter but um whatever they're doing with their life as a layperson as a skilled a tradesperson as a person that's in management or government or whatever it really spans the gamut here's a simple convenient framework they can plug themselves into it makes sense and they can apply it in a practical experiential way on a day-to-day basis as they line up to whatever situations they're stepping into they can settle and open and get a better read on what the story is before they jump into something better line themselves up as the, appropriate character for that story um to make room for all the nutrients that they need to, function well in that situation first of all with the right preparation yeah which is what we're going to cover a little bit uh excellent and i don't want to get ahead of ourselves i'll okay now it's fine i'll duck out at this point okay um anything i'm gonna move on here soon but we have a minute here anything, yeah hi sensei it's dusty i'll ask something that's okay, um, autumn told me about a quote that you said and i'm probably paraphrasing here but it was um something along the lines of uh well learning from our mistakes is, okay it's meeting, yourself, meeting the person that can solve those problems i'm not mixing the quote right now but my question is george leonard talked about taking the hit as a gift and as a gift as a gift yeah and then you're called last week was something like well i understand while learning from mistakes is a good thing, meeting, the self that can yourself that can solve the problem is where the world work is at work is at but like hang on a second just dance stop give me a second give me a pump can you see me i got you okay you took the hit now what's the benefit it calls up naturally more nutrients and suddenly i'm better at taking hits or maybe or maybe i don't feel like taking a hit where are you going but i move appropriately so take the hit so that if you use it right you can grow with that oh since i said that more than once in a few different forms, is that mary up there no that's kenny okay, so go, ahead i'm sorry i jumped in well no we just seen you stand up and do that was all of a sudden it was it was your response was much simpler than i thought i was like yeah just, do it just take the hit as a gift but i guess i'm wondering like boom the hit like, what's happening at that moment the connection that the there's something going between your the hand and your head like your whole system is reacting now if our system is more open it gets to react to react faster so i, stretch it out so you can see it i took the head and said okay wait a minute what's happening i, just took the same thing and i stretched it out well that's going on really fast after a bit, okay, uh i was teaching private uh i could do that now and then at home they asked me to teach private to certain westerners anyway there was this naval captain and uh i don't know i must have fell asleep or something, and uh and uh this american naval captain uh it was striking me and as he was striking me i caught him in the eye and i felt real bad about it because he's my private student i gave him a black eye dear god he's a naval captain uh so anyway i was very apologetic next time he came i gave him a, bunch of flowers for his wife in case she didn't think i was a mean guy beating up on her husband and anyway but dang it can happen really fast but uh that's an idea fast i gotta react and you go crazier but so to slow things down and see how they work okay and then practice with the slower forms, and then eventually you speed it up a bit, following a certain pattern that you're using, and then you continue and after a bit you get fast okay tai chi is a martial art yes it's an exercise for old people in the park uh but, it's also a martial art even though they're practicing very slow in a mix-up they're very fast with it but yet all they do is basically practice slow kind of thing i don't know if i said that well i'm not a great tai chi master but anyway we covered dusty yeah perfect thank you okay, [Applause], yeah and these simple processes when i asked you to go uh i sort of mentioned a little bit a couple minutes earlier from bobby to robert and ado or, a one by one to a two by two to a three by three after all you get oh i know that it's like no do the other way around take your time and flavor it more it's like you're a little kid and you're eating too fast and mommy says chew your food and taste it so i'm just asking you to taste the process along the way because you'll be human condition you'll be too fast and i know this i've, tasted this before mom i don't have to taste it now i'll just swallow it, like no it's really important to, really have some depth of experience depth of feeling whatever you want to call that ah and of course later yes it is faster but it's faster through the experience not through the knowing about it okay something like that okay, okay, this one here there is a little problem or confusion that exists ah uh let's see let me use an example if i may ross you're on madden you're my moment john russ yes okay, uh can i use your comment from i believe it was last week as a reference sure okay you were talking about getting to a better level which is that line there okay and it was a nice level right yeah it was very nice and you said oh, here i'm a nice guy right yeah, i started i looked on you a little bit there and i said but who who's the character and you blinked a little bit on me okay, not saying anything's wrong but we do have a confusion i'm trying to clarify and so that was a good example so sorry if i brought that up pointing you out as an idiot or anything bear with me okay that's fine all right we get to a better level and the qualities at that level are, nicer softer easier something okay and because we haven't distinguished the character line that's why this is a cute diagram there is a character line here that is often misfired people they identify as the terror i call that terrain okay at that level terrain nice, calming uh, whatever it is and the identity oh i'm the nice person i'm the calm person i'm the loving person i'm the uh whatever person okay and that'll get you into trouble in the bigness of creation something because you're missing a main piece the character the center the plant whatever you want to call this guy okay are we sort of sort of okay for starts well i hear what you're saying okay so we're going to do something here let's see can everybody just settle, i was going to do standing but with my other camera out it's too much hassle so just settle ah as if we're easy it's settling into a better level whatever it may be for, you okay easy settle there's a different terrain going to show up for you here a little bit what am i looking for easy the eye easy that, one easy approaching a terrain i thought that was katya is that you ross no it's my dog i knew somebody was barking [Music] hey everyone a terrain [Applause] somebody want to throw out some examples one word should all be that's necessary or very short phrase here what kind of terrain since [Music], what level you're at what are the qualities there again whatever okay remember ross hit a level that was nice, what's yours open mics i'm gonna need some examples let's say it's bob uh although uh energy's nutrients of clarity in this terrain, okay in this terrain feeling, like you're the, clear one okay, oh i'm clear not yet not yet not yet that's the terrain that's very good, you want to hang out in there and whatever soak with it for a while that's fine but you don't have the whole picture yet that's a nice terrain somebody what's your terrain you got nothing you got under there come on easy you've been settling you've been opening, ah, is it not calmers and not quieter is it is it not calmers and not quieter is it not nicer something hello one at a time supportive, supportive, okay, okay, it's a supportive terrain okay again there'll be that tendency to think that train is the character oh i'm the supported one or i'm the clear one as noah because usually not yet not yet let's continue with terrain one more example easy settle open dimensionally we're moving into finer dimension here that inner sense of finer [Music], easy settling i get a jungle very quickly rainforesty okay growing okay uh so people get confused uh that'll be some kind of life-giving it's very alive very what they'll they call a, rainforest jungle it's, damn alive so you're not tarzan yet okay that's the terrain and when the last one somebody easy settle, the terrain that you're since experiencing since experiencing it yeah expansive, called terrain yes, see inner finer dimensions aren't inner spine or smaller it opens up into a terrain if you would or a sense of more space don't get carried away with that don't there's no more space more space i'll go into that another time but uh definitely a inner sense of more expansion expensiveness yes okay, now, again the tendency is for people to identify as the terrain okay so what should we do here to make this, centered, character, plant that's the that's the terrain who is the plant who are you the plant see and uh to sort of overlay the uh potted plant picture we've settled down to a better level dirt okay, a better level dirt and you say oh i'm data and it's like no, no that's the terrain that's a level of dirt dimensional energies that you're at now we shift into the center the character the plant with the sense of it up down centered pump, who are you with the terrain that you're on yes with some up and down pump now we're sort of i don't know what to say shifting our focus i don't like that focus word focus word but it's shifting from the terrain yes, yes to this line here who are you the character who are you the plant so you feel yourself feel yourself okay now on this one and be prepared to play the and game so real quick one word feel yourself what first one first one you're feeling yourself plant centered character what you're feeling first feeling okay i'm more rooted okay and then again i might go rooted, okay, who are you you're the rooted one and soon we'll get to an end so rooted okay better rooted okay somebody alive okay a live end live instills my terrain still i'm sorry still was my terrain so a liveness coming up through that stillness okay there's a terrain now we're working you the center plant character you're more alive is that what you're, more alive is that what you're saying, yes, okay i'm more alive i'm whatever more energetic and uh you could even probably feel that through the body right and we're alive okay, now there's more than just that first word that you threw out so i add the and so, all right so we continue more alive and bob's case it was in the land of clear uh, who's the character there bob the center the plant uh common reflective one okay calm and reflective one okay calm reflective okay i think he threw two of us calm and reflective reflectively calm it's fine now you experience yourself as the character calm and to some degree reflective, okay, somebody you got the game so we're on our terrain but we shift focus i don't like that word uh shift our attention from the terrain to the plant-centered character and who are you what are you feeling about you the centered one the character, more accepting then say it's molly and i just want to say that in this moment this character, is feeling a total effervescence in my entire body as though yeah that's fine let's keep it short molly i'm just saying you know and there's a sense of, being the terrain almost it's like okay no, no, no, stop i want to be clear here molly terrain is the terrain and plant is the plant yes there's a strong relationship but let's be clear because we have an unclarity between these two these two so don't be too fast and talking about oh i'm part of this terrain because now we're going to get confused again potentially i'm trying to clarify this confusion i'll be scared i'll be still i like i like her pheasant and, i like that up and down center flavor you, the persian character plant you the centered one hey i'm ever visit i've seen that one before by the way of course, many of us have oh there here comes molly, yes, okay, bear with me i am okay and i would like to do at least three or four, zones of magic number on and what else what else keep the up down pump going uh so bob you said what the what the your next two were clear and reflective sensei clear and clear and reflective sensei clear and more effective and let's throw another and at you and continuing the feeling of the centered one and sometimes a little trick there i, think helps i repeat uh the two i had before, and what's next powerful, okay and with some power okay so good and it just happened a different way it may have confused them he'd be uh picking up calm and it's only powerful and be like no wait, which is it or something uh so there's different attributes at this level with what we're doing i'm calm i have a good perspective and, i'm very strong feel that strength yeah that'll be something you can feel in the body that we're oh i am stronger, i didn't feel like picking up weights before but at this moment just screwing around on yours i wouldn't mind just checking a couple of dumbbells and you know i'm feeling stronger yes are you any, of you following me did we do enough of, of those i'll walk you through one if you're confused along the way roth you following me sure yeah okay, okay so again i'm just trying to clarify a confusion that when we hit the terrain and damn the trains in finer dimensions just nicer finer dimensions are nicer okay uh, they they're vibing remember the trains are different levels of vibration rate heavy terrain i can feel it next level terrain i feel a little z through the body but it's not right easy, next level of terrain i'm not sure if i'm feeling i'm so i have to shift here to sense feeling oh yeah it's quieter calmer easier yeah so those are dimensional ever finer through the dimensions using terrain or these floors we've called them before floors okay so the difference between the character and the terrain now this is kind of important that i, would sort of like you to have some practice and feeling for it because come the day which for some of us isn't that far away where you're going to be out of here and you're going to cross over into the next and because your people are pretty cool you're going to end up at a probably a fair level of astral plane let's say okay, and in a fair level of astral plane it is nice to rain it vibes nice okay, what i often hear from folks if i check them out see how they're doing is oh my god there's no physical pain here where i'm at how nice the body doesn't hurt anymore, there the terrain is nice okay, but then they tend to get stuck there it's nice but they get stopped there where we should really be able to continue and continue and continue kind of a ways to go yet uh, but when they don't know okay this is the train and it's beautiful in whatever form you're picking up the beauty of the astral plane you'll be in who are you who are you and work that for lack of word center line who are you when we get more harmony and balance between that another form of balance that better balance should facilitate moving, past that level dimension into the next finer level dimension we have a journey to continue we're not finished yet on one nice astral plane move along if you don't want to move along you hit that plane after a while you'll get bored or something will happen and you'll be born again and then you go around you'll be born again, and but eventually you're going to get a little bit bored with it okay tired of that like jesus said there's something more than just returning trips anyway i'm straying off too far here but the balance of center okay, and that terrain line and the center line, facilitate through into the next finer dimension that's there okay if you miss that part again there'll be a tendency to be too heavily into the awareness and you'll be aware of it but you're not quite really and it's certainly there you've missed something it's hard to continue properly after a bit so this is uh so this pattern is, a good pattern that i hope in some way you remember okay you remember because when you hit the astral plane you want to uh, utilize that if you're smart okay, i've seen some beings hit the astro plane and, very quickly some months whatever uh very, quickly just develop, develop, develop, develop, and i'm like wow what a what a lot of development within a year mart time a year's span i don't know what it is in their time and in that plane but uh within i've seen some people really develop, okay uh okay uh as i mentioned nikki happily surprised me is he stayed with whatever pattern he was working and he developed and stayed with and he developed because he really wanted to be come back more advanced as an actor really wants to make the big time so he's, setting it up there so he can better move in on the form that he's taking a little feeling i have about you autumn that, that this your more original self uh made that call and it's, all unfolding for you especially when you can reach contact that inner self we get there by easing the eye anyway it's another conversation this self, uh we've uh we've mentioned before uh but i have to really highlight it some night but not tonight where the hell are we i'm gonna get lost here, the terrain is the terrain is the terrain the plant character you character part of that okay the balance between you at that level and that level back to you is a balance pattern we play with that with the center circle we, did it standing, last month uh center to the circle as if there are energies or something emanating, circle is touched and it retorts back okay at which time the center does a slurpee stand up feels a bit better makes another call hey i feel better but i don't quite feel great yet greatness, that's sent out to the circle, is its partner it goes oh okay the circle is a great warehouse boom, sends back one hell of a lot of nutrients that's its job okay which the plant intake, ah, boom, uh so, that uh how am i getting into this stuff why am i getting this stuff now are you following anything i'm saying or did i get lost here you better say something before i get carried away where are we here another form of balance see all the different forms i try to lay out are based on sort of where we are in the manifest creation, [Applause], and how to travel through how to navigate the manifest so i present different forms center to the circle is a cool form okay uh the cross addition sign is a cool form the one by two by three by is cool potted plant really a nice one it's cool uh but we're passing through the same terrain i'm just what to say not coming at it from different ways but different presentations because some of you might get a little different, oh sensei told me said you'll have your favorite, okay, but try some of the others it's good okay, so you have your favorite uh but you get a different a different sense by trying some of the others a little something in there same terrain but you picked up a little bit different by shifting the word from energies coming back there to nutrients a lot of people go oh that's a bit different we're still talking about the same stuff oh it schmoves oh it's coming uh but, each sense gives you a little different i don't know the word flavor perspective we're not changing the whole diagram we're not saying the universe works this way no it doesn't work it's not to say no it does not work that way we're talking about the same manifest universe, how to move through it into finer and finer, all the while clearing the eye so as we do this one easy the eye to start to establish you see the eye a little more room and more settled so that a better center lines can happen okay, as we easy and settle next dimension better character terrain finer vibe of terrain all the while the easy the eye is moving along with it okay till eventually you won't be i anymore be oh self, self okay, and then after a bit as you continue that'll, upgrade, uh i want to show finer of itself so my words naturally change oh a more original self a truer self it's just a continuation of this easy the eye that, self easy, with that a finer self okay so that's the pattern that we're using uh to work our way from the heavier remember we're in a pretty heavy level here, yes, we're upgraded eights easy i mean there's a bobby but there's a weird bobby kind of tighter there's an insane totally off the wall dangerous lock them up immediately weird bobby easy, easy, easy it's all here and now okay so that helps it's here and now here and now okay it's not just an idea here and now includes the under half now we've i've mentioned that before may go, back on it because it's very important the under half is not known well, okay underworld oh my god okay, hell is down there heaven is up there stay away from this go to that misunderstanding settling opening at first there might be some fear because there uh that's why i told you the snake story the snake pit story that's why i mentioned bob what's her name then spanish none saint theresa of avila sensei and apparently from above was telling me she was sitting, and suddenly she's experiencing a sense of wild animals biting her oh i've been there done that mines were snake years are wild animals hey cool we're kindred souls here we all hit that level at that at that level of it ew this is horrible it's fighting me easy, settle, have the guts to stay with it and open and settle some more ah it'll just get finer and continue just get finer and we can uh, more effortlessly move through the heaviness of manifest to the finer and then they'll be even much, better which will hold off right now don't get your head to a fire ahead of yourself there but following that pattern so once you get a good pattern follow it try some of the others okay, all right where the hell am i, don't know say something did i say anything intelligent you were talking about the different approaches that um that's akin to different languages right so um the potted plant or the one by two by three by or the different kind of vehicles are like talking about something in spanish or something in english sounds different some languages are better for certain particular, conversation and be careful of certain traps i'm not going to get into this so oh they must understand because they have a word for it so you do too just no one's introduced you to it oh the great spirit oh you mean nutrients man i know what you're talking about something like that i what i'm trying to say is i don't want you to bulk with somebody else's fancy word or some other cultured word because you don't quite catch it catch it one reason i didn't go heavy into the jet or at all basically into the japanese, uh you say oh they understand i don't i'm a westerner i don't understand i'll never make it i didn't want you all to go there go there so from the get-go we tried to use more english words why not yeah like uh you know the eskimos have more words for snow than we do guys i don't worry about that i live in california, anyway, uh hello out there in the world where are we does that do you anything hopeful clarification on enjoy the terrain but don't forget to feel yourself with a few different and okay uh sensei bob here one thing about separating clearly distinctly the experience of the character and the terrain, when i'm the character clearly then i can begin to actually experience absorbing the nutrients from the terrain into myself and that begins the process of change of change but actually experiencing the nutrients coming into me yeah so then you sort of overlay the potted plant format if you will yeah, yeah so you can mix and match to your benefit so on this beautiful train and i'm experiencing this and this and this and, that and, okay now all of that is really feeding into me here, and now we can move into the next beats of it [Music] um, [Music], slip by me slip by me hello out there where the hell are we are you following me is that was that sort of semi clear i, i would agree with what bob steve here uh what bob just said just said and what i find so useful is, that they don't seem like even though terrain is terrain and, character or center is center there is a relationship and the relationship is, really experienced how the how they, there is an interplay between the two and that's again where i like to overlaid a potted plant because that one can show that interrelationship that relationship a little bit better i, think at the moment, because the plant says hey i'm not feeling well or whatever i need help the pot soil circle the great warehouse says okay and by law it pass the feedback, i like to take it from the roots because my plant is hopefully open rooted, the, nutrients come deeper and i like to slurpee them up the plant really intake them not an idea i, ah, i pumped the pump don't mind me i go into my heavy-duty warrior crazy guy here hey da anyway, uh so that gives me a little better flavor for what you were talking about by doing the potted plant format yeah that i might not pick up with the terrain, and who am i and who am i there'll be some but it won't be as clear for me as the potted plant format of really eating up those nutrients as the plant would do and grow bigger stronger prettier longer-lasting whatever thank you yeah covered, ah how are we doing how are we doing sensei it's justin i, would like to say um just to, build on what we're talking about here about here that it, seems like as we settle and open to finer levels uh we become more available for the nutrients that are in the, terrain around us we become more available and we can then absorb and utilize more of what's there yeah, okay availability for me becomes a factor or question yeah okay uh you just said something important let me let me get my map right okay say at bobby's level okay, and he says help but i won't suddenly on that first beat suddenly be the greatest guy in the state, or the country but i but i peace out of time here get the flavor of it, uh, so you've got your center calling out to the circle you're circle responding back center improving a bit checking himself out himself herself whatever and saying hey and that's next and that beat continues and to move along dimensionally there by continuing to ease the settle in open so, on that form the form that we're talking about right now you settle into a finer dimension and you continue that beat but in the finer dimension your call-offs are a little bit better and the retort from the warehouse is a bit better yeah it's got to be more faster here i am kind of thing because you're at a better level where that can work better, okay, a tighter smaller too much identity that way i'm gonna slow it down i'm gonna interfere with it i'm gonna stop it oh not me oh not me this is for him but not me oh no he, did, judo when he was a kid not me but him, because he did judo what that's what are you talking about come on this is everybody for everything you want to be a better healer boom do your pattern you want to be a better puncher boom do your pattern better actress boom do your pattern everything's cool okay see spiritual people oh no uh you gotta sell candles and insects no man sell a second-hand car oh that's not nice secondhand cards that's not spiritual they've just stopped the whole from happening with that spiritual stupidity excuse me but spiritual stupidity spiritual nonsense it's here it's available it wants to work that way as you upgrade it doesn't matter what you started with it'll become its pure form [Music] even second-hand car sales will have a much better purer form if you do your beats so, it's not just only those guys because they're catholic or those guys can do whatever, come on already oral sensitivity you all can do this you know uh you just gotta catch on how it works, and you gotta work it when he said keep training he didn't mean keep doing those damn mitchells sorry for you like you know people but keep training the beats the beets and whatever style beet you're using keep training the beets and if you want to while you're trying doing the beach you want to do a check hold it a moment at this level let me check my tennis head let me check my techniques let me check how i'm doing with two attackers, let me check by swimming laps and keeping time on it or whatever that's fine, but just as a check then come back to your interior work hit another level you feel pretty good okay pause and you try your techniques whatever they may be okay did you follow that because i, think i said something cool there but yeah anyway, uh hell help i'm starting to feel dispersed help me out here where the hell are we sheehan chris here from new zealand hey you chris hey you're just um exploring more of the what you're saying about the pump so you would pump the character to help move to, boost up the terrain or you'd boost up the terrain or your pump you you're pumped to want to miss that last character to uh vitalize the, system to get the uh the next dimension or trying to get the next i guess next level but it's not quite the wording i want but you pump the character a better a better character okay following this pattern now it doesn't matter oh god am i going to confuse you all uh you can start with there's a lot of energies now i kind of believe that yes there's a lot of energies let's say okay now, in that in that who am i we just did this, form but i turned it around the other way before i said terrain, terrain now who are you yeah okay we could do the other way around in following that is me, me now what kind of train is there for me how should i function in the world and i used to joke with people there i would say uh maybe you're supposed to shine shoes, and that is even the first couple levels didn't oh of course not shining shoes is a little demeaning certainly okay not the shining jews in the meaning but you know uh that, would be too small in occupation no, i wanna open a shoe store maybe or, design shoes or something would be more appropriate so you can come at it either way i hope i didn't confuse anybody with, that that's great to be a being and check out the terrain or you can have the terrain and check out the being some have preferences i'm a center type first, okay jack what is the circle type first okay, lauren's a circle type first uh um jesus says he likes to balance and i say fine that's cool now don't forget those who like balance have a tendency of slacking is that the word you use t-shirt you use a good word slacking and yeah i think it was something like that i don't remember exactly what the word was but it was a good word i'll remember it in just a minute then anyway of because, usually if you're balanced at a fair level you're superior to everyone else around hey, i'm the best in my club i'm the best in my club i'm the best in the dojo i'm the best in the band whatever, and you tend to hey and just stay there being the best in your neighborhood that kind of thing sensei the word was complacent, ah, i like that word complacent, yeah, and that's what happens by the way it's a good word for the astral plane thing i was trying to talk about uh the terrain of an astral plane can really be nice okay, but the ability to move along without that peace i don't know however you'd say who am i at that level but there'd still be that centered piece okay uh, will really be interfered with really would be doing yourself a disservice, all right all right throwing out am i getting lost here where are we since it isn't asia um, i just wanted to lean back into the thing that chris was saying um and he was uh i think when he was looking for the word uh levels i would probably say something like layers, so, levels has this kind of thing like there are major jumps but inside the in the terrain, uh there are actually what i would call layers and sometimes they're very fine between, uh one another okay but isn't another word for layer being the next level the next dimension and then you could you could certainly overlay them yeah them yeah and i was just uh i was just uh, so you just wanted to give them a different word for the same thing yeah kind of okay, looking for layers and uh or levels and i said you know maybe, layers is a way of talking about it because we are a community, that is that is especially in practice that this is not um this has some scholarly aspects to it but it's really based in practice if we don't practice i think justin was saying that too experiential and doesn't mean yeah and whatever level you're at or zone you're in it could be experience oh i see i understand i'm out of here you're gonna screw up yeah you overlay the you start to overlay the things that you already know or from a from a previous um layer and you start to overlay knowledge into experience that you don't have uh words for yet and rather than just be in the experience of that of that space of the new terrain you're already trying to figure it out and gotta double check because the awareness factor is so predominant [Music], not just in the in the states not just in this dimension i'm bumping into it with beings in finer dimensions, this is an ancient from the beginning problems, aware of and missing the experiential of right just for whatever reason happened you jumped the gun maybe we all jumped the gun oh wow look at that and that's it and we didn't realize wait a where and an experience and then the combination enters in more properly so something like that we won't go into that because at the beginning of creation and it's beyond our pay scale at the moment but something like, that heavy proponents in awareness of and so as a dimension opens uh one of the major ways as the next dimension opens you're sort of aware of it follow me teacher so you can add or change, settle get to another dimension and my visual sense of it oh it's a bit lighter and brighter as i and i'm aware of it light and bright yeah, yeah, a lot of white things there yeah whatever they are yeah i'm aware of it i got it aware of it now the next piece okay, let me experience and again let me experience and again more like oh there and there i'm starting to feel touched and my sense experience is starting to really feel touched and i think i mentioned before the one to five awareness is pretty fast whoa look at that yeah but to get the experience i say one to five which might be one to ten or one to twenty for god's sakes but that means this part of experience is a little bit slower, doesn't mean it's dumber doesn't mean it's dumber doesn't mean it's beneath the awareness it's just different, it's just different and we haven't yet integrated it yet i think that one of the takeaways from this evening is as the character uh moves into the new terrain um, that take the taking the time in there rather than already knowing what, this is yes take the time to be in it to soak in it to uh to kind of listen to it in a certain way without pre-knowing what it what it is or what it has to give you yeah, uh sort of don't know what it is to feel it for a while actually you got to feel it you got to choke in it and watch out for that awareness because there's a place i try to explain this a little bit uh maybe a couple weeks ago or something with the bathtub right you get you see the bathtub and it's steamy and oh i know it's warm but you haven't sat in the bathtub and it's a mineral bath you, haven't gotten any of those minerals you get a little closer oh you feel the steam and feel the moisture from the steel oh i've experienced it not yet people don't be too damn fast there it's an ancient problem, take your time now begin to experience it you put one toe in the bath easy oh i can feel that yes one toes work, you continue remember one to five one to ten one to twenty whatever easy experience, instead just like going into a hot bathtub slow and slow until you're fully there fully enjoying fully uh being affected by the minerals of that tub sure is that the right way to say yeah, so those of you are fast with the awareness yay for you but come on you missed the other half hard to really move along properly if you keep missing the other half i don't want to scare you but in a certain form it might turn on you a certain bit and you won't know what the hell it is easy settle deeper looks like easy settle deeper and say oh this isn't this is fertilizer oh easy settle more oh my god nutrients, and you haven't finished there's more there with that once you catch that it won't be able to scare you because if you don't sit on it with and get some experience you can be all happy and bright light and suddenly is being thrown at you in great amounts and you won't know what to do with it so i'm trying to give you a little heads up a bit better how it works so you don't get confused along the way really thrown off so have some working practice with quote the underworld okay, such as commies are there in all of this in all of it but hit the under because it's, it's, not been, approached as full as it could be okay, we paid lip service to a bit oh uh oh uh i do i don't i don't fall over i'm centered, yeah, okay step two you came into the dojo stumbling a bit no you don't stumble as much you got a little bit of center you're not finished so i made jokes at you, tennis players don't usually fall over they're centered why are you any better than them okay the golfer doesn't swing and collapse, he's kind of centered what makes you any better than them so yeah but that's just the beginning of this journey of center circle or the, on growing at the ongoingness of the of the addition sign into finer and finer here and now dimensions i sense that's mike sure, um, tj kind of um well didn't steal my word but it was the was the word that um i had also come up with in terms of what you've been saying is that it's important that we don't get complacent, that, we don't think we've got it got it or that we've arrived or that this is as far as we can go there is always more it's a continuing journey it's an endless journey, it's an endless journey basically, not endless, but yes in a certain way, yeah i don't i don't mean that in a there's a negative um connotation to that and i don't mean it in that way but just it's a journey that we can't see the final destination no but you get a sense uh or something you know it's i hear it's beautiful i hear it's like wow big time wow you can't imagine a wow with anything that you've experienced kind of thing so we have sort of a you know returning back to an original god but god but in its original format kind of thing so you have some you've heard some stories about how it might be you're under 20 i don't know your sports but you're on the 20-yard line but you know there's a goal post but you practice at the 20-yard line till you get to the 30-yard line you still know there's a goal post but that's where you are and you practice there to get to the whatever did you follow that i thought that was cute yeah enough you're right um but yeah the basics are uh get a good training pattern and, train, practice essentially train with the internal training internal training, okay so whatever form you're going to use, and be prepared to change forms sometimes you get i i've had forms in the past i don't remember now it goes back pretty far historically but where i have a good pattern and after a year or whatever uh suddenly it would like disappear and there'd be another one there that i'd pick up on but that was my favorite for that year and i was doing good with that and there's a little perplexedness when that happened but now i kind of kind of i don't know again i don't remember those little years sometimes but uh but, yeah it's like it's like the system is saying nado you've done enough of that form now it's time to change forms in a short period of time i pick up another form and stay with that one for a year or two and then similar thing would happen to be a different form uh so that used to happen to me i forget all the details that goes too far back in history but uh yeah so do be prepared for it or purposely, change, change to form sometimes you know uh you know do your chanting form on mondays and your centered pump whatever form on tuesdays and go back to channing on wednesdays and you know your whatever training even in bodybuilding we don't work the same muscle all the time with the same exercise it gets kind of stale so you change it you get a bar where your hands are turned out a bit more and then you curl this little change affects the bicep a bit they're different okay the undo barbell you just do dumbbells and you do them sitting instead of standing and on and on and on it's kind of if you've ever trained it's kind of basic training okay so find a pattern and train we did the chanting one with the center circle the way we use uh, yeah, yeah, we did two sounds ah your call your call ah to the o, responds back to the ah better centered, i, oh responds better because it's a partner it responds better with oh you can take a pause and say okay let me check myself out here at the center character plant check yourself out fine now again continuing r to the o and o to the r that's your practice pattern for practice not two minutes practice if you're really interested you'll find periods of time where you can stay with it for a while whatever a while it's half an hour an hour, okay now and then i don't want to get into it now and then in tokyo uh i would take uh a whole day plus for time 12 hours whatever and sit and just forget what i was just sitting just like basic meditation but just going long term with it continuing long term with that thing uh that's not something i'd wanted to do every weekend uh my wife wouldn't have cared that much for it uh but uh now and then yeah it was it was it was it was kind of interesting kind of i got something out of it okay oh my god we hit up our time really, where's it go thank you for hanging out any less quickies because we ate up time anything autumn how are you doing good dealing with some nutrients i think uh i have a kind of a question but i'm still formulating it so be patient with me, the, the character is, it emerges when it's clear enough right, and the character emerges the eye is clear enough when the terrain is in the eye if you've got a tight eye you can't get a new character because you're already pregnant you can't get pregnant, you can't get pregnant it's a dumb story i used to throw up it's brilliant if people feel it out if you're pregnant you can't get pregnant they're already impregnated themselves with a lesser eye so nothing can happen okay yes i'm sorry go ahead and, then, the, nutrients that come in i guess i'm wondering how to how to really how do you know when they've been fully absorbed is that when you're testing it with your hand or is that when you say full at that level but now if you want to go another dimensional level there's fuller at that level a bobby absorbs let's say 10 pounds in fact we use 10 20 30 pounder bobby's a 10 pounder if he absorbs 10 pounds he's a full bob he's still a bobby but he's bobby at bobby's best if he trades in easy does a pattern then there's robert who's a 20 pounder and there's nourishment there to fully nurse a 20 pounder so it's, kind of comes up yeah cool thank you yeah thank you okay people time, thank you thank you for hanging out i hope you got something out of that one anyway just don't confuse the terrain with the whole picture trains nice beautiful your dimension inside's finer beautiful, you're not finished there's something more to be done there there's something more to be done there okay thank you thank you sir

ah let's chit chat for a little bit here waiting for the late comers pop in would you all do over your vacation you had a week off any great insights questions, ah, what are you up to out there in relation to work what are you up to out there sensei this is dennis finish uh can we talk a bit about what we discussed yesterday yeah if you fill in make sure you fill in, for the folks yeah okay yeah okay sure yeah so i've been working on this uh project over the past few months uh this is actually something that i've been thinking about for like 20 years and it's finally starting to kind of come together and uh i had these uh i had these meetings over the course of a couple of months with some folks and i was uh preparing for the meetings and uh you know did all my kind of research and got myself ready inside as well as outside for them and i went in on these meetings and uh you know they went exactly as i as i hoped that they would go and you know was able to listen very, easily and adjust as needed and answer questions and ask questions and all that it was like they were perfect and i ended up getting a really good thing or kind of pretty much like everything i wanted kind of came out of it and then came the point now i'm moving into like the next phase of this project and it's the point where i have to actually put it out there and i gotta tell you i was telling sensei yesterday that it just like one point last week it just all kind of like who the hell do you think you are trying to do this thing you know what is this that you're doing and suddenly i was almost to the point of like you know panic in a way you know for, a bit and it took me about almost a day to realize what that was and, settle back down, here you know and like no i've gone this far i have this experience i know i can do it because i've proved it to myself over and over again easy you know easy with all that and, that's uh stuff that was coming up became really became fuel and uh it was uh normally i know the other guy you know before you know a year ago two years ago would have just spun off on it and kept spinning off on it and it would have just, you know i would have fallen apart but i uh it was something that, surprised me to the way how quickly i caught what it was and how quickly i was able to get back on and adjust make the adjustment and, get back on track so and it's you know a lot of it on all of it is, because of this work that we've been doing so thank you yeah it's kind of exciting yeah so to reiterate uh so he was okay with the first phase of his plan his plan now came the second phase uh more uh put it into action let's say and the second phase apparently called up a lot more energies pushed him a bit you know who am i kind of think but he caught it he said settle down opened up opened up i would say allow the energies to mix so that the center is more equal to the circle, center ah i love that and is getting ready to uh whatever go into production or the second phase where he's got to activate a bit more and do something but he's got now the nourishment the plant has been fed the better plant capable of doing this is there and you can begin to feel that i can actually go into the next phase and pull that off so my, words for what he said are we okay then yeah, yeah it was exactly like it's exactly like that yeah so thank you thank you thank you ah people where are we somebody else something um hey bob it's catherine i've heard from you mr cornball where you been i've been here okay hiding but okay i don't see everybody uh on so um i have sort of an interesting i don't know if the other one was really business oriented but i've started a new endeavor with a new business partner and some inevitable sort of personality style differences have come up as we're working through and all of a sudden i had one of those duh kind of lightning bolts like oh she's circle and i'm center and i remember you asking me back in august like circle center and i said circle and you looked at me and you said but you sure and i'm like well it was wishful thinking that i was circle, it's just i'm you know straightforward so um so um having that insight has given me just an opportunity to really examine what is it around the circle that i can incorporate more of and she really has no language whatsoever for energy for anything that we, work with but i brought it up to her today during our meeting uh as we were talking about some uh different values we have and how we want to move forward and you know she got it uh you know to a certain degree so um i just thought that was so curious that oh right this is what i get to practice if you will, cool, yeah it's good when your business partner in this case and you that you service similar language where or you can bring that up again at other times that should facilitate yeah back to your thing about you thought you were a circle but then you realized you were center type more uh are you sure about that are you uh are you a com a combination because some people are center circle, center Teja likes the balance of that uh would you mind yourself in that category or do you really consider yourself first the center type you know that's just such a good question for me to sit with in this circumstance because she is so strongly, center, i have to i feel i think some intuitive level that i need to balance and be very, strongly centered but i know with harv he was very strongly centered so i think in that case i could be very circle i think i think that's what i resp, the framework i responded to when you asked me asked me you know what it was about six months ago because i, was still feeling so keenly, the grief and the connection and uh wanting that balance and that tapping into the power of the circle uh so i'll give it i'll definitely keep feeling it um it can't hurt to play because in a certain way it doesn't matter as long as you come to a conclusion to facilitate your continuation with more balance between center circle and circle center for your development uh, so just funding around with it would be cool to do whichever style you are at first, uh, i'm starting to gargle here so yeah, but it's hard to believe a, alignment for the county is, it really a vast circular style it's got to be some sensitive some place yeah it could be alignment for the county we used to sing about it yeah thanks bob yeah sure okay uh, people how you doing out there anything [Music] okay let's see i'll say something sensei that's okay this is dusty i i've been thinking about that center and circle too and like um form and flow and, i probably more of a circle or flow like i can get lost my imagination i'm forgetful and um but it's almost and i kind of don't like the form i don't like details and structure kind of but what's been coming to me with these nights and with my practice is that, form, seems like there's some like movement in form or it's not so rigid yeah maybe i thought yeah um yeah when you realize there is a in that case you could use form and flow i guess uh that uh that some of the form types locked into the form and they sort of get rigid maybe rigid thinking rigid body movement potential, uh, but when you realize there's two things going on so form and in relation to the form is we call it flow is a certain amount of flow so within that form it flows and it flows within that form uh but sometimes people get locked in on one style you know the form we've got to do the form this way and keep doing it exactly that way see the way my shoulders you got to lift your shoulder like mine you got to look like me okay, uh reminds me of the uh frankenstein joke movie joke movie walk like this you remember that scene i thought it was quite funny walk this way anyway, thank you dustin thank you okay uh should we move into tonight's thing what was tonight's thing uh positioning you know positioning okay we should take a couple of minutes go over quickly the easy the eye okay, um let's see you won't be able to see my tiny picture here, that one easy the eye and i want to do it as around here when you've got a crazy thinking head easy i gotta easy that there might be a lot of pressures or activity from the fuller of the system so instead of trying to easy that craziness easy infers something a little bit larger a fuller so at least at least this big around me okay that's my starting reference easy, easy and i'm sort of waiting till i feel like i'm, at this level at this level should i do this standing let's just let me do standing yeah okay, there we are okay so easy the eyes not something i do in my head easy, we're inferring here easy the eye here okay [Music] easy, this is a good basic easy the eye because on a tighter congestion you know a three bite to a two by two a one by two a half by it sort of congests and what we're just trying to do is clear that uh clear that so in a certain way we could say we're starting from a congested level, easy the eye because the eye has got spun in there into a tight weird body weird body okay easy the eye easing the eye as the eye starts to unwind from this spin in there's a little room so i said the last time we did this uh you, you can't at first grasp what an eye is i'm saying at first let's just use this a little more spaciousness just sense of a little more room okay as easy a sense feeling sensing, feeling there's a little more room, ah, sensing there's a little more room again not just an idea okay, the whole thing is easy the eye this whole thing where the fullness of where i'm standing is easy the eye you see the eye okay so it's not just an easy the idea that's congested between my eyebrows easy here okay, and then we did different levels uh what do we want to call that different dimensions sometimes we check so for example easy the eye at a certain level there's a sense of a little more airy space here okay sense experience and then i might say okay now let me check the body yeah, yeah the body is moving better it's some one of my tight days i didn't do any warm-ups any stretches so i could start kind of tight but this is suddenly ah the shifting is just doesn't look too bad for a tight old man it's not too bad for starters not my best level but definitely so i'm easing the eye then i check back see how the body was doing in the easy the eye there was more space with each of the eyes so the body system mix started to get freer yeah still some shoulder pain there we'll see later on goes easy, we continue with the next level whatever word you want to use dimension of let's get this open space maybe a little bit rounder here maybe a sense of a little bit deeper easily [Music] the unwinding continues, leaving more room here now at this level easy the eye double checking back with the body at this level or this degree of more room less, it's still painful but half, of what it was a minute ago i know bending the knees is not too bad okay remember i sit out on my chair all dale every day so bending of the knees is oh wow they actually can bend a bit so i'm just using checking the body to see if i'm on the right track with easy the eye easy not thinking about it it's a sense experience easy let go let it unwind there's a little more room here, easy the eye maybe more of an internal sense easy the eye ah easy the eye and then whatever things you would notice like my breathing starting to change in more room this unit wants to begin to breathe better wants to open up his chest a bit i want to stretch the back there a bit bend the knees i just noticed oh yeah ah, referencing things are a bit deeper in opening in opening so it's a little more room a little deeper, checking back with how the body now that it's starting to open and easy how the body is doing in that more openness, and i'll confer with you guys about that here, okay real quick before we move on easy the eye [Applause], a sense of that happening referencing back just to check now and then, make sure i'm on the right track if it's easy the eye the body should be freer in there and start to do things freer, ah easy the eye i could have used other things could have used a chant simple one good starter with ah easier the eye easier the eye okay so i could have used a song to see if things were opening pretty good whatever, okay a lot of different possibilities talk to me chris here from new zealand i think it was a probably a perfect example of your one by just naturally wanted to expand itself with that more room that was i can see how that game appeared so naturally yeah, i think they're basically all the same thing just using different examples but basically, it's the same universe now how do we trek through it and develop yeah so yeah so whether it's a potted plant or a one by two by three buyer basically it's the same thing because we're in the same universe and how it works is the same okay, potted plant the kind of plant you'll be will be different in somebody else's plant you got musician plants martial artists plants therapists plants you know so, that changes but we're still all in the center circle dimensional creation, okay, from, tighter, to finer and finer and finer and finer okay i think that was not bad badly said thank you any, anybody on that ah, easy the eye either any sense on, the easy the eye sense, or, anything about the, body as there's a little more freedom how the body changes naturally sensei linda esken here i found i was feeling more like settled grounded very stable sort of melding with the floor under my feet i'm standing so just a sense of coming, down out of my, busy scattered data yes [Applause] yeah, with practice i think we'll tend not to go up so high and make that so important again it's an ancient thing fortunately they've been made overdoing that since the beginning but that's why this here and now is so important, words like roots or that's why we introduce you to more depth and, try to make it nicer i don't know if energy does it let's call it, nutrients let's use the potted plant the sense of nutrients of this deeper underworld it's not some scary bad place you see ah the here and now to move through the here and now of it oh sensei don't go anywhere it's here and now but it's inner finer here and now don't go anyplace looking for something finer out there you, lose your lineup you lose your positioning so that's what we're trying to highlight here positioning so easy the eye here okay, and better things happen we'll continue uh so that's my word map word map some levels of ease of the eye easy the eye so whether it's a bobby robert not doe level or a one by two by three level of easy the eye you come up with your own measurement tool and then eventually soon right now in fact uh the eye in its uh more experience of itself it was very elusive as i it's an elusive word but we checked back with the body to make sure we were on the right track hope i'm saying this clearly as we continue to easy the eye it, it's a self it's a bigger piece of paper a bigger piece of the canvas at which time it won't maybe wants to name itself it doesn't want to say i anymore once i say i'm a self okay it's just a continuation okay so okay so a more open eye becomes a self but my word somebody else could use the different words okay ah, did i say that okay was that serta linda is that yeah very okay yes thank you all right so self suddenly easy the eye is in the eye and there is a self that's here now whether is that good enough level to make its presence known or not if not right now it's very damn soon okay you just continue it easy the eye and be open for something with flavors a bit different self, okay self okay now because we change words don't go from i, i to, self let me let me think about self don't, don't off someplace it's here and now i easy the eye is here continuing eventually, self, self is here present self okay now there's a certain level dimensional level where self begins to i don't know what words use make itself known you can sense it not think about it sense it sense experience it that it's its own thing experiencing itself its present okay i'm not talking about the energies that are centered in circled and mixing up a character, myself, self i don't get caught up in the energies because i'll get confused okay so that's why i say it's kind of like a piece of paper and yes there will be some energy drawings anytime on that paper centered a circle and a picture of a character oh robert or i'm a two by tourer or i'm a, fair day person i don't want to deal with that right now easy, i want to deal with self as a piece of paper a piece of canvas a piece of clear glass self okay and i want to treat it here so again don't let me think about self don't, do anything like that here and now inner finer self okay somebody who's early in the game your first sense don't know if that's the right word your first, something is here i'm feeling something, is here i'm feeling something i don't know what words to use self, the beginnings of self, showing it's here hey sensei and i, think that uh sometimes when you when you um so i think that um you i like when you say hush because that sort of like it takes it out of the head the quieting of the discursive mind and goes more into a body and that body for me is um i don't know when it when i start breathing when i notice that it's not me breathing but it's breathing there's, a it's like breathing itself that's that for me is something that's the body breathing itself now get off the picture yep let's come back to the clear piece of paper itself if not it's okay um i would say um [Music], that there's, more refinement and just meaning itself that's another word self, self fear is refined what's that mean or what is that self that's okay sean we'll pass on you yeah thank you somebody first sense of self help a sense for me it's like there's a space but it's not the space of the body space it's a, different space um before we had space and the body would move but this space is still it's almost separate and is uh for me there's a waiting there's a okay this space, it's very calm separate from it from that body space very different so that texture or something yeah oh it's going to stay cooked yeah there's a textural different sense self, self somebody almost that's right great one almost like it's like some someone's in the room sort of feeling like there's a okay, like he's in here and it's not high like something's gonna pop out of the thank cupboard and later as, we get you to return reflect the words to yourself and more of yourself and more of yourself where self is there being self uh it'll say something like that to you and say you know i've always been here you've been running around but i've always been here nice that you came back to you me it's you itself is but we detached we spun off we got involved so as we easy the eye we're just coming back to ourself ourselves and we'll continue with uh and come up with your own words a finer self, a more original self a clearer self the more original self that's just some of the words that i use to, keep it going or to keep going with it you all come up with your own words makes sense to you there or you have a feeling for okay, so all we're doing with a tight eye is unwinding, and in the unwinding returning back to a better level of ease of the eye a nado instead of a weird bobby and then self actually and, in self go ahead i was laughing who's that destiny who i can't hear who that is i, was laughing sorry i just thought it was funny that you said i nadeau, uh, i don't know what you said about yourself sorry i wasn't muted okay all right all right now people we've touched on self before okay we had i think at least one good session with it at that time by the way i want to make a little correction i threw out the word over self i, don't think we ought to use that i think we have to erase that because over self has a sort of sense of up here over self and the emphasis now is on the positioning self is here easy the eyes here self is here and as we move into finer and finer and finer it's here i also said don't go anywhere inner finer dimension here-ness okay one reason he stuck to also had his hand in a physical art to try to improve that hereness okay as opposed to just being another philosophical i am aware of things up here he told me he could have done that but there's other teachers teaching that and he thought they were missing something the hereness okay also understanding the underworld as being a beautiful thing it's not some horrible whatever in finer dimensions it's true colors or true nutrients or whatever begin to show and we're part of that we're part of that that's the whole line-up thing i'm going to get lost here soon uh somebody where are we uh susan you on tonight don't jump too far for the troops she's sort of advanced on self now we've been working a lot uh but this earlier stage of bumping into yourself help me with words here of word self begins to make itself known i don't have the words help me yes in that earlier, self, yes, you said something to someone shortly ago about self has been around for a long time and that was the first thing that showed up for me tonight was the longevity the, continuity, um, that self has been around for a very long time and self will be around for a long time yeah forever yes, so she's at an interesting level uh, the, innate intelligence of self is speaking about itself it's, sort of saying i've been around for a long time and yeah, yeah don't get caught up in odds and ends and lose sight of me i'm, the paper all these drawings are going on in the paper goes the distance if you're interested in an original, beginning don't lose the paper for god's sakes don't get wrapped up and now wow, it's here you got a straight line shot you all do straight line shot here and now easy oh help me don't want to get lost self-self-self, the earlier stages of self wherever you're at any sense of self you're asking for descriptions of how people experience it as they ease the eye and bump into the self yeah easy die easy to eye easy the eye and eventually self is there okay, and as you continue easy, the finer of self because as you're easier really moving through a dimensional inner finer dimension so the bitter of self can show to the point where you go oh my god yes something is here it's not an imagination it's not a i hope so it's not my idea it's a something here self don't know how to say it any better we have to create a whole new language here anyway nobody wants to say anything about, self when it first begins to show its presence, hello there we go yes, somebody who's that uh linda hello me again um given that what i was sensing earlier was a sense of settling and sort of downward, stable energy what was coming up for me now in the context of self is um is feeling like um like some sort of support foundation um an anchor or like the tail on a kite something to kind of let me be, freer without coming loose from the earth or sinking okay oh they're there on that word that's, a good word uh that you all should pick that up eventually uh there starts to be a lot of freedom in itself okay remember the i was locked in by bobby, robert, yeah, yeah, but he's easy dimensional and one of the things self uh will show highlight will be a bit more freedom of itself it it's freer yeah eventually am i jumping the gun here uh you get to a self that is not in the confines of the manifest oh sensei's language to manifest creation if we go june, june we move out of that manifest universe into finer and definitely there the self is saying uh will express its freedom it's really free so yeah, if i had to put it in words the, words i would hear self saying are like i've got you like you, can feel freer within this support okay somebody, the early stages of a self-presence sensei this is liam um and so for me what i'm getting kind of in these early stages is just kind of a, feeling of a beat and, kind of just observing there's all the creative things that can kind of come my the referencing i can do but that's not self those are the things that, are kind of getting drawn on the paper just as i reference this, beat and, that's if i just follow that track that brings me more and more into self okay maybe, uh maybe we say self is also part of the center circle, center beat okay, uh just be careful you don't suddenly get caught up in the drawing that's going to occur there and, stop playing with self right playing with a picture that goes on at that level itself, but i sort of don't want to get into that, right now kind of thing yeah but, the self-made catch there's a beat of self because there's an original center circle in the very beginnings of creation one of the early moves was to have a center circle b to create okay you need to create so it's a very early piece of creation so all along the way there is that beat okay right okay right okay yeah, if i can add uh kind of a sense that i get from that is differentiating whatself and what's the creation and feeling the mix getting a good mix from that not getting, a good mix from that not getting mixed up but getting a good mix of creation and self, yeah we will do that along the way kind of like i did on this the first standing one which is uh easy, easy, and then i checked with the body the mix to see how it was doing we'll do the same thing here but not, right now maybe not even tonight whatever but easy the eye you're at a certain level and then you can say okay and, the wording and we're going to create a whole language here shifting my focus ah i don't like that because it's focus let me look and see uh shifting to okay now at this level that as self i'm at because of the energies in and out and because there's a character on the center certain kind of plant where am i uh, who am i the character and to feel the energy the colorings the paint brushes yeah, and then you could just check and see what level you're at by that experience and then shift your focus not right let go of that and go back to the paper continuing with the paper did i say that right people i was following sensei yeah, that was great i just it's important that we don't get confused with clear edi paper and suddenly energies, [Music], okay, okay, and think oh those energies are easy the eye or that self and i no, no the paper is the paper the drawings are the energy stuff the languaging isn't great but not too bad easy, so okay let's move along fast oh positioning again do be careful of a start now go out and have an idea about itself again it's here easy so it's, here okay well no sensei stood there as oh sensei or who is she above aikido even better uh it was here all this inner finer stuff was here, showing in the heavier dimensions it was here wasn't a belief i believe he was trying to show the hereness of it okay he could have done generally a better job it's okay i say these things i've talked to him about this but uh because there was a lot of fear by the japanese of the underworld so he had to be careful he couldn't use certain words with them because they already had in the war and the occupation uh a lot of the words about the underworld were kind of words they heard when they went off to battle and died and stuff anyway uh they just don't have a good sense of hunger not that americans do hell is there in heaven is up there oh stay away from this i got lost bear with me the here and now of things here and now okay that, we have to catch on and one day we will dialogue a bit of how did it happen that we suddenly got into this upper finer dimension meditation and lost this rootedness okay and one day we'll a little bit about that not tonight we're eating up time but we'll try the dialogue as a possible example but time to include this whole presence which includes the underworld in the finer dimensions of underworld the nutrients of the underworld centered and circled, and centered the whole schmear is that the proper use of mine do you want to say anything about positioning in relationship to this um, to help us get a better picture of how you do that i get the idea that we should do it i think we're all opening and feeling it i just wonder if you have any anything in that area maybe not no worries there's the first dumb example easy here a little bit deeper energies are mixing up a better center starting to break easy, deeper, it's sort of opening so i know i'm moving into another dimension here and here mixing up better here and another one i won't break with that it's here what can i say it's here a sense of opening up here why don't some people catch the depths and the opening maybe because of the fear of the underworld oh i'm not going to open up there's a crocodile there if i open up he's going to bite me on the ass, so oh yeah i'll be aware of it but i ain't going to experience it not really not really is that what the problem is the fear of the underworld so i don't know what else to do but lay out those old ancient practices which are really cool uh to tell us we're heading in the right direction and then just continue to head in that direction sense experience deeper sense experience opening i don't know what else to say it sounds like me there's no other tricks, it sounds like a paraphrase of what he said to you it's now you saying to us it's so easy you guys it's so yeah because it's dimensionally boom, boom, now one problem is the fear of the underworld so when you go boom, boom some people go boom, boom, and they like the awareness they're good at it unfortunately they're missing this half and the totality there for so once you get past that misunderstanding about underworld uh it's here, here, here you're right in alignment with an original uh we'd have to in that case uh, say the original creation circle with the center that way that when you're positioned here june, june, you're heading right towards that okay i sort of didn't want to use that circle type because people have a tendency to be aware of it uh, at first we have to do a lot of height depth underworld upper, underworld kind of thing of thing uh but anyway whatever you're indirect line with direct line with yeah you like the phrase a golden bridge is that directory golden bridge floating bridge floating bridge of heaven yeah it's just a direct line we've got loading bridges and flows all over here here's your floating bridge easy there's a direct line from finer self, shoot here that's where it was sensing was so cool you could move from this old man and had something happen where this fantastic being was here floating bridge we're in direct alignment so the position i'm just trying to help you start better aligned it's here okay don't come up here and look around at it you're losing the hereness of it okay and those people who are more uh circular types tend to have a lot of awareness okay and they're smart but it's like yes but there's also this experience, this part that will help us stay in alignment in alignment okay so if you're having trouble being aligned more and more and more one guess might be a fear of the underworld believe it or not all right okay that seems to be a major misunderstanding throughout creation ah let's move along here my time okay self-self self susan yes, sensei okay, dialogue a bit self and the continuation of self you following me let them hear your voice instead of my voice for a while okay um if i could speak for just a moment on the underworld one thing i really like about the potted plant theory is how well it reminds us to connect to the roots to be to have roots and to connect with the nutrients so that, image with the potted plant theory i think really, helps i also thought so because it was a benign is that right word benign uh way of presenting the underworld and he's pretty close to the truth settle open you get more nutrients for the center, you have your own character so you're, your own plant, so, center, and plant and plant and you character that's all the same thing there and you're in relation to the circle and the circle helps the center and the center gets better uh touches the circle better but if it's mutual there's a more than harmony between those two okay, uh as you go finer uh, they'll show more their harmony very, tangible okay now don't confuse people move on to self, self continue itself how would you lay that out to them or give us your experiences along the way susan you there did we lose her susie she's on the road we may have lost her yeah, lost her thanks again i, don't see her listed now bob yeah sometimes on the road uh she's, a cauldron uh she's way up there in a booming so we lose her now and then when i talk to susan they sometimes we have to make five calls back and forth because we keep dropping calls anyway chris here from new zealand i like the way um the reference back to that sort of character and that, underworld sense because certainly for me i always find that, shooting back up into the head, so dropping back down into that into that, sort of lower field not so much the body um has certainly helped the relationship with self sort of come forth, and then um so i had a i had a interesting sort of meditations session and it was same thing i sort of kept beaming up into the head and um it was like no it's you, i kept the linear line that's how i keep seeing it it's always going straight up to the head whereas they said no it's not linear to the head it's in to the in me you are you are to the self as always yeah, so it was almost me yourself i guess as, a as you say the language it was almost uh a pure beam inside which manifested but in that manifesting got tangled up with all our extra bits and pieces the wrapping the, layers the dimensions into that heavier so that sort of relationship so the body had to let go and the self also had to work in relationship to help let go of some of that, winding up which i sort of i'm not too sure that's quite correct but that was the sense i had out of that, moment so i recognized that always going up in the head and coming back down into that underworld and letting go of each layer each layer coming back to peeling back those layers so if i spoke fast yeah, that's it you enter you enter you move from wherever you are yeah, you're a one by one you do a little something and you enter a two by two space okay yeah yep okay yep okay at first at first you're looking around so to speak and it's not clear you know maybe you don't see anything okay it looks maybe empty easy you hang out easy now the energy activity in a two by two will begin to make itself known and there'll be energies up and down i'm a center type so it shows easily for me first ah center up and down and then the parameters or circle oh i'm in this room i hang out there in a two by two and they mix up me character i'm a two by twoer, or change the, the words oh i'm a fair day guy oh i'm a robert i'm not a bobby anymore and i act like bobby and i talked about robert uh act like him talk like a move like him it's not as good as nado but it gets me through the day sometimes get on the mat i can't be a robert i've got to pick up the pace robert doesn't do it for me on the mat i got to be a nado minimum, minimum so i take a moment there for that to happen okay uh so uh so in the space things the drawings will get drawn okay so don't clutter up the space in the drawings and stuff is all i can tell people, catch what i'm saying is an ongoing pattern, in more space if that's a space of easy the eyes self okay, then, the drawings will start okay, the character will be there at that level, hang out and experience that for whatever, and then you let it all go and you continue back to self the next level of self you continue get to a finer level then if you want you can put your attention backward onto the drawing and at that level it draws nicer clearer and creates a little better character so uh, what's the word uh um not clarity uh a simple math i like trying to lay out a simple math here it's a couple of odds and ends of tricks uh if you get pushed up you said a couple of times pushed up the center okay easy check your opening check your pipeline because it doesn't want to push you up into the head per se check your opening so when it comes up and down it's mixing up and center to the circle and the circle to the center so you don't have to get pushed all the time and deal with that you naturally open a bit more so it doesn't push you it just moves and the movement is really going to become a mixing, so you learn little tricks like that to save time make it easier right if it pushes me up into my head and i go little bonkers for a while it's going to take me a while to ha, hey ho i, get bored with doing kindergarten stuff over and over and over that way so i learned little tricks along the way okay, if you feel it's going to push you too strong back off settle down a little bit more open up a bit more so when you step into the whoa of it you're more open for it, doesn't push you it mixes you fuller it's mixing up three by three here if you're a two by two or stepping into a three by three it's probably going to push you around of course it is so you sort of catch that oh this is going to be stronger better double check my opening here so when you step into it you're open to it and it mixes up faster better boom you're a three by three so little tricks like that if you play you, sort of learn your own tricks i'll mention some along the way but also you have to learn your own little tricks so to speak i do believe i can't teach you every little trick maybe i'm not sure well i think that the going down that settling as um letting go has been amazing it's been a huge point for me and my journey yeah each character let it right go and then come back up that's been brilliant uh bob if you care susan is back with us susan thank you yeah thank you chris uh susan hey sorry about that you sure can hear me i'll teach you to live on the boonies yes, i think you sound pretty clear okay, if you were laying out in your words for the troops here uh self, and, self, and, more self how, would you lay that out what what's your progression of sensed experience of self i want to tag on to something i just heard you saying about as i [Music], play with more of the transparency of self, the naturalness and the ease of whatever character that shows in a situation, becomes much susan you're on fuller, so for example if something susan we lost your first sentence can you go back one yeah and hold it a moment susan hold it okay, okay uh, okay uh, you brought up transparency itself susan i'm talking to the troops tonight we have not introduced that it's a little advanced oh excuse me while i chide susan, self to self to self to self we're not quite ready for transparency of self that's in a very advanced world we'll get to eventually i hope people jose you're on yes okay [Music] can i say that at a better level of self i don't feel the pressures that i would normally have felt okay could that be the level where we're obviously moving past the manifest universe i think so okay, that might be there [Applause] and again that's a big jump can you continue with next self no transparent yet was lyndon to refer to earlier that the freedom the sense of freedom, the sense of freedom yeah um is a and yet at the same time it's, a reassuring sense of freedom it's not a sense that i'm lost kind of freedom it's, a reassurance that i am free lined up as self yeah and right there would be important uh san diego you like that right she was repeating your words right she was saying it better yes a reassuring sense of freedom very, good, i like that better okay and, uh, then you said something susan about uh the freedom but uh and it's a good trick here in freedom there might be a tendency especially for those who come out of a long history of awareness uh to be free in their awareness where i would suggest you still stay use the line up the presence that there's still a center circle even in the freedom of self and you kind of use that for a reference and there's a character there even at that level and you use that for a reference so you don't suddenly become an awareness-free floater which would be a strong tendency for a lot of people and they lose the uh boom to more original because they started to go wow hey whoo free so i like what you said you sort of inferred there was a yes, and what i was trying to say earlier when i lost you was that um that sense i had earlier of continuity and longevity there's a sense of i'm positioned on that line that line so again a sense of placement in your word tonight of positioning on that line of continuity longevity foreverness yeah and that line could be seen as the bridge, or the i used to call it stringer uh what's the baby word uh what's the baby cord jesus people and biblical thank you um that you're on there at a certain level but you're on that chord you can't get lost there's a heavier and click expect there's a fighter and there is a, home base eventually, eventually you're on the line that's what i was trying to say with that, a keep position because you're, in alignment with okay you don't have to torque around and look and i know it's fancy been there done that i know it's fancy but, it's, not good enough it's, it's we'll lose you along the way eventually oh in a nice place we call that the hammock space oh yeah this is cool uh but that's not how to do it properly we got integration we have to get back to the beginning eventually or the origin, what's some sense they call it the source, uh the one you like source i like sore source good word the source before the creation there's a beginning source okay and that's our eventual destination eventually, but if you start tripping out a certain way uh god could be adding eons of time here so, to retain to retain all along the way uh positioning okay, can't go wrong with that sense of a center circle, center that goes the distance uh character believe it or not goes the distance that i think spiritually has been lost in spiritual work uh not uh not uh acknowledging the characters the bobby robert nado pattern uh later the characters get very fancy uh we'll have to dialogue that a bit sometime, uh, i think we're eating up our time here susan uh thank you yeah um anyway people self come on come on easy itself oh positioning so if we square away my word square away and i begin to do my uh inner finer dimensional work a couple of levels just to check then i and i'm retaining my squared awayness at those levels bobby double check squared away robert double check, squared away robert double check squared away now don't double check good enough and once you get the flavor of how it works now we can begin to move faster after a while not faster as an idea faster retaining this line-up positioning okay what me and susan have been playing with is uh we line up a bit and then for lack of words we haven't developed the language yet they say self could you position a better with this body let's call it could you position better with this body okay, and then we double check again here from heavier double check and again we make a call to self, sense of self, self could you be present here better aligned and what i'm trying to do with that is, we're seeing a lot of selves that are over stay over around we're seeing some selves that are over to the side saying i'm, here but if you sort of go inside you're sort of empty because they're over here uh i told you a couple of stories so i'll mention one uh where uh, uh if of not tonight uh, this uh this uh sick kid some disease guaranteed to die uh and i thought well for, research work let me let me work with them to ask the parents if i could use their kid to check out and they were blamed for anything because they knew the kid was going to die and so i asked the self that was way up virtually in another astral plane i mean he was whoosh and i said hey if you come down here and line up i don't know what words i was using in those days this goes way back line up to this kid we could maybe get some healing here maybe heal him and the guy way up there said hell no i'm not gonna hear and line up and so we had a bit of a with each other for a bit uh but then maybe he was more right because the kid the way i explained that his car was a total wreck and i was asking the owner of the car to take possession of this total wrecked car and the owner said screw you i don't want that car give me my insurance money i don't want that car okay so that was somebody was really pretty far away one me and susan were working on a young lady because the family uh the dad and i were fighting too much and the self was up here and we were called in a cave just a little bit up and in a cave but wasn't fully here so we asked the self what's the problem ah they're fighting and saying ziki said well if you come here and be more present you'll have an effect on your surroundings your parents i think in that case susan asked the parents to tone down their fighting near the kid uh anyway so that so the kid did the self did align better with the kid and susan could see the results pretty quick the kid was a really a beautiful little girl and her beauty was showing and her presence was there and all kinds of other stuff so we've been playing a lot with selfs and there's a lot of not good positioning by itself so what my main point uh would be if we sit and settle easy the eye first verse your first basics for a few moments self selves up and ask ourself to position better in relation to this body it's not an idea, in relation to the body so it's here, inner finer here, here richard i don't know how to say that better here it's here okay idea about it is nice but you still got to do all of this to have it here okay, so ideas idea the actual experience is the actual experience the actual oh sensei put it in your body so it's here okay in this case through the finer we're calling on self to say would you position better okay and we're thinking that's potentially really cool if it positions better uh it has its own kind of aliveness not an energy don't get confused with energies but self itself is sort of alive there's a better word than that but i can't think of what it is right now uh it's sort of alive as it positions better its present aliveness radiates and highlights all the other stuff highlights, the energy body the physical body the surroundings it radiates life force i'm sorry i don't have to write, the word okay so it's just positions there's a lot of healing possibilities and that's just one, item but those people are in need of healing this is the major easy, as self or any even any level uh um of self along the way boom it's being more present you'll get that radiation but a better level self a better little self, should even be better okay so a lot of healing amongst other things if you're and also to realize after a bit that the distance from here to self is not really a distance as you fun around begin to realize it's just really close and then we refer back to sensei no time or space okay we couldn't figure that out but as i played more and more i said oh jesus this is this that at first seemed like three galaxies away alas star trek is really, quite right here okay yeah, we tried to show you the first baby brad the first baby okay easy, some degree of an energy level energy through the body better yeah i can feel much better it wasn't far away as right here okay now of course you might want to settle and open and all that stuff to touch it but after a bit as i click it there it is and it's still gone and still gone and still gone so we showed this baby examples but don't throw them out that is that is that is that is that is that okay so careful of those simple practices you know yeah that simple no it's the beginning of a pattern that repeats and repeats and repeats, repeats and repeats and repeats, in a finer dimension yes but repeats the basics and they're all the same it repeats thank god this creation would be insanity if we didn't have some potential for a repetitive kind of thing we'd be locked, into lobster trap forever we'd never be able to get out of that kind of thing fortunately repeats easy the eye later becomes easy the self ease of itself later becomes easy to find yourself it, repeats it, repeats it's an okay word so anyway uh so if we can align you better to begin with a couple of levels to be present invited sort of in i think is what i'm doing, so self is more present self is more present and when self is there and so, close uh that's cool that's cool you play with it we ate up our time thank you for hanging out thank you thank you see you next week i think i hope thank you so much thank you bob thanks very much thank you for being here, lauren will be back next year same time thank you bob thank you

welcome, i'm getting close waiting for you that bob's ready to start thanks for being here welcome, bob should be here shortly thanks for coming should be starting shortly just waiting for a little cube from bob that he's ready to go thanks for being here looks like we're just about there okay welcome to the virtual dojo robert the dos sensei teaching class bob is ready to go thank you all for coming we appreciate having you here and bob thank you so much for being here sure i had nothing better to do afraid of that okay we're on ah out of sorts balance we'll get into that after, a couple of minutes so uh let's chit chat for any late comers to pop in anything up last week any carryovers problems questions insights i cannot last you, know [Music] bob you're going to say something say it for god's sakes hi sensei i, like the focus that you had last time on self and how the pathway from first to easy with the eye and then some space and then more and eventually you get to sell yeah, and we've been there before was it six months ago or so we were talking to a quote and over self and again i don't like that word anymore uh because i like to have the alignment the positioning better and over self tends to put it up around kind of thing so i probably won't use that word anymore, uh yeah so easy the eye which, again, the, self, the eye selfie kind of an elusive piece so knowing that we started with easy the eye, i know that's not the eye is not tangible, okay so we use this, sense of just area room easy this area rule easy the eye and there should be some sense of oh that feels a little bit bigger deeper bigger meaning a little more around easy the eye okay and then eventually the self that it's directly in relation to it's, i is a small piece of the big paper a bigger opening we call self and then we continue with a more original self a finer self whatever, make up your own words but we use some pattern like that uh then eventually there's a very original doubt we're heading towards a much bigger piece of the paper with that but along the way the self can begin to sort of make itself known better it has a, flavor itself a, texture itself so it's very elusive with ease of the eye and just this airy space but as we continue with that the self ought to make itself more known remember six months ago whenever we were talking to quote over uh there was a sense of a presence it was talking back to you uh you were all jumping and saying things uh so it wasn't so elusive at that level okay, so, sophie bob and are you okay with that is that all right sensei sean here hey sean there um i think, that the sense of um the finer and finer sense of self starts to starts to feel like it's in natural communication with everything around like the even the elements there's a sense of um, uh a give and take there's a rapport going on, it's just a natural part of that sense of self uh and i'll just change it a little bit yeah very close there uh easy the eye self the energies that are moving the nutrients that are moving the center circle, center uh they're communicating back and forth and then for easier we can what's, the word be more aware experiential of their communication we can sense feel, their movement their communication as far as nutrients go it's like you can assimilate them you can take them in and as far as communication goes it's like there's you start to notice that there's, you start to notice that there's there is communication coming through from all, levels yeah we'll, do some finer work on that one day hopefully soon but yeah i think we're in the ballpark there [Applause] anybody how you doing what's up hi cincinnati chris here from new zealand chris the um i really enjoyed the, last session we talked about um a bit of discussion about how the, tendency to have that eye of the self above the head in the head instead of working it down below i've been working, it down below i've been working a lot with that this week um which led to a pretty, um, i guess i guess surreal sort of a keto session on a thursday night which it left me while i wasn't left i had a nice experience of i guess balance it was openness i felt different in the body um not so much communication but more just don't overthink it so the, the class i was taking the class was less talk and more just well you just watch an experience for me so it was um and that was merely taking that experience in that self more in the body lower that deeper that deeper half which was very complete for me yeah, we want to as i mentioned before a very important piece is this here and now positioning here and now going finer you call i call it dimensional finer uh but the positioning uh because i've been uh having dialogues with self not you people it's a whole different realm there itself uh and a lot of them uh, aren't positioned very well we have a lot of overs i think i mentioned uh, we have some cells that are over here to the side uh we have some selves that sort of don't want to be here and they're back a little ways one young girl was checking out with susan was back aways and in a cave we called it because her family life wasn't too cool she didn't really want to fully be here so she was hiding out back here i mentioned uh a dramatic one when i first, was working this and there was a very sick kid with some disease guaranteed to die, soon kind of thing and i said to his parents can i work with the kid just for my experience and i said sure whatever because he ain't going anywhere you know and his self was way to hell and gone i said hey self if you come in, line better with the kid there's some chance of healing or something he said hell no i, ain't coming down into that there was a feeling like the kid had crash-landed when he was birthing and so i, felt like it was a, totaled car and we're asking the owner of the total car to take possession of the car the car and the owner says hell no i don't want that car so he was way back and ain't no way he was going to come in and play uh i mentioned to the people who are into the healing i think it's very important if we get this any level of self present in that good lineup that there is um set up or something somebody cutting me off uh that, that, that can aid in the healing with this sense itself is accessing or has its own juice and it can radiate through uh, through the body and the run in the world you're, in so for healing to have any level of inner self and that self come up with your own word radiating it's aliveness come up with your own word for oil and in there there's a possibility for healing okay uh so again if the self is off to the side or hovering around it's not positioning well enough to take full advantage of its juice it appears like and i'm getting a fair amount of practice uh with itself there and uh seeing and, dealing with their sense of things their misunderstandings uh so even certain level cells have misunderstandings okay uh until you get finer and finer and find yourself then they get really, sharp but until that time anyway can i ask another question in regards to that with a position of that self with is it the same as the vintage game the more you sort of align the more you align with touch can i ask that will the self sort of permanently shift like i always have this awareness above my head but this occasion it was more because i focus more that lower under half as it gets more present it will take into account the, under half of things also and it'll be more uh so when i play with self positioning better i'm getting more and more lower or it's, kicking in more lower and in here not just it's lower down there not, that kind of thing nor is it up there nor is it over there that's fuller it's fuller and in its fullness says hey i'm bigger than that i'm deeper and i'm, bigger for lack of words so in its positioning it'll, uh hopefully find its own ground don't know the word there so, yeah anything deeper you're on the right track deeper here it's here it's here it's here yeah but it may show deeper here it may show uh that it's finer level of self here so basic here okay uh you're on track if you want to change the not methodology but the words core physical core is here now the core is recognized and activated it activates the body gets better you continue there's a finer core here now it may appear a little bit lower there's a finer courier now we're getting into a tai chi format oh the arms can move very freely let's continue easy here there's a finer core inner finer dimension the core there and now the, legs are affected by it because it's more fully here and the legs get freer on kicking and stuff and then you get a little bit better where you've got a both legs and hands and the whole system so you could follow a, core format or a chinese type sheet format but continue, continue, continue okay so we can change the words in i don't know what to say different format or also tracking we're still tracking still tracking if i use a center and i continue centering height and depth and depth and height i get a better center things are a bit better, if i continue centering see a lot of people center a bit and then they stop because they feel pretty good so they stop or they're better than everyone else in town they stop but if you're going to continue keep searching so searching keep doing the work uh, centers, in the universe enormous there's an original center okay so the little bit of benefit we get from this is just a come on it's like whoa look at you're a bit better centered how much better things are wow why stop there people will okay, because that's all they wanted they wanted to feel better leave me alone now they don't want to do any more or they're better than everyone else they must be great i've got the best center in town i must i must have it all i understand everything about center they stop okay, so uh a researcher a continuer uh, guys like o'sensei go the distance through a lot of travail okay, a lot of pressures and he worked it out he worked it out he kept going he kept going he kept going i feel lazy compared to him does that help anyway thank you sensei yep, the word pioneer or inventor seems to come to mind because like, as much as oh sensei was an inspiration he you, still have to go through the work you can't you can't ride on his coattails oh you no on his hotel hell no hell no hell no, and he laid out why, he was he was in his own way kind of a mapper also i consider myself a mapper he laid out a pattern but you in your system follow the pattern, and they don't try to mimic his he warned me a couple of times not though i'm glad you really care for me love me whatever, but you can't mimic me a hundred percent you know good he mentioned that he brought that up a couple of times okay, so you catch a good pattern that catches your attention but instead of going oh that guy that guy my teacher my teacher uh yeah no you, what are you doing with that pattern are you opening to that pattern are you doing your journey lack of words to that pattern okay so uh so yeah sensei just, just uh just a comment here, i have seen you in the past um many years ago um just walk behind a student and sort of mimic them to the i mean it was it was uncanny how you were, uh good at that and i instantly recognized that was your capacity as a um as a student to emulate as best you could your, teacher and that like you said that wasn't good enough and, he demanded more and likewise um i feel as if that is continually your um comment to me which i appreciate again and again the, stick-to-it-ness of internal research not going outside yep oh yeah, yeah how many more books do you have to read no not none a certain point we may have to stop and you sit and you go through your own stuff, you figure it out it's beautiful stuff but there's a few tricks, easy open easy open not to glom out too fast yeah what this is happening that's happening easy let it let it unfold let it clarify itself so we try to teach some tricks that will help, okay, yeah but in a certain way everyone's gotta, sit settle and open and take their own trip in their own universe their own creation okay, we're in a very heavy we got scrunched in very heavy or we scrunched ourselves in here very heavy we have to untangle from this heavy and then not untangling you're probably still running into a lot more heavy it's less heavy but it's still heavy but you have to come to terms with that we try to help by saying hey it dimensionally gets finer or the uh say what game it said i opened up and it said i hate you oh easy don't panic nadal easy settle open, on that same voice too say what, did you really say inferring this is a finer dimension and then it says i'm like i've been trying to talk to you for a long time you never listen oh okay easy settle open following that same line say what inferring a better finer and it says something like i'm just here to help you oh, oh, really we'll see easy settle open and, continue so you might run into harshness but it's, because we're a little heavy that's good finer dimensions finer dimensions so that's where games like say what i know you're an oh okay easy settle open the next dimension say what yeah and it stops after a bit it might say for on the second one you're not too bright which is a little bit better than you're an okay easy settle don't panic open say what, and i'll say something a little clearer and probably better i just continue and continue to continue, yeah gotta tell you this over and over again with these things i know stories of my experience let me continue i'm on a roll and i basically did it easy this is weird i don't like snakes i'm sitting what the hell's going on easy, boom, okay, and very soon they weren't biting me they were smiling and very soon oh they're not snakes they're spiraling energies oh i have little version energies oh their energies oh cool i like energies hey, hey energies nutrients we're using the word now oh okay, so essentially the same game don't panic don't freak out don't jump the gun trust the ever finer so that it can show itself and it's truer, nature truer color truer level joy you want to say something no i just wanted to say i appreciate your infinite patience thank you okay thank you okay anything before we uh touch on tonight's topic no big deal big simple basics i think but anything before we yes danny here danny here danny there last week um, asking the self to position better with the body yeah so that, that rang really true i, as soon as you see her i thought yeah that's me i kind of in my life i stand to the side of things a little bit ah rather than that's yourself, and your case yourself is off to the side i checked it yeah i know yeah so, could you notice it anyway i noticed it yeah i lived like that so i um that that's interesting by the way people trying to file that away his self is off to the side and he danny the person, lives that way off to the side i don't know what that totally means yet but oh let's file it away sure i agree with you um so i, so i, after the class was finished i, it was a timely for me to invite, self to if it could position itself better with my body and um it was the, response was immediate okay that um immediately any pain that i had in my body was gone it was like okay in your body my body left it's the most fruit i didn't you're breaking the pain was gone, yeah i'm breaking up sorry can you hear me yeah now and then okay so anyway i think you said in playing this game of being present of course i was a good first set and asking the self to position better okay that i believe you said uh very quickly uh, body pains or certain pressures were just gone interesting good feedback see if nothing else something happened something happened okay because by his idea he can't get the pain to go away but in playing this something happened okay, again people note that something happened go ahead then you got anything else here yeah it also it also after a while after, a while after i stopped i stopped withdrew from that and enjoyed not being, without pain it felt to me like you mentioned the road or track before, and it felt that i was on a truer course somehow, and it was and it was very familiar and friendly so a truer course did you say on track yeah yes old track yeah but i think that's what we're trying to do with this alignment thing away bobby robert whatever and then as quickly as possible get to a better level and ask that level to line up better here so we're on track you're directly in line with yourself and the uh and the uh what happens at a better level of self your balance in your universe all of those things should naturally happen so yeah, yeah sounds good to me danny keep playing yeah, that was incredible and surprising thank you people, here if you're interested play, play okay, play just this whatever you whatever sense of self that you have now settle and, just a sense of self could you position here okay see the distance between bobby i the guy who says easy the eye at first and the finer level of self what am i trying to say uh the distance factor after a while there is no real distance factor it's really like here and now okay when we journey it feels like a distance and we use those words unfortunately okay but they're really starting up butt up so the better you can be on track the easier it might be for that better you to be present here, okay not the great word yet but good enough to sort of get us going for another session later, okay, all right we should move on a bit to tonight's topic uh the other day i was sitting on my front porch, uh which i am worth to do ah and that's all what's what word, did i use uh out of out of out a little unusual for me i mean i'm not great but i was kind of out of sorts i couldn't quite get going on anything okay hang out what the hell and i was reminded about my first basic that i liked i like centering, and i caught on fairly quick to up and down energies okay uh let me stand for that oh okay you want to play with me simple, energies, there we are yeah, yeah okay easy, he's easy he's easy there are energies coming up through the system and an energy is going down through the system, easy there you go let me figure that out i don't know if i understand stop it stop it easy here [Music] there are energies flowing up through the center and flowing down through the center easy, [Music], that pass i may be too fast for you people i don't know but that pass felt like they were coming up from floor level, up, and back down to floor level okay if you're there's no big, big that's fine you start with where you start okay, easy and again energy flow up forward fuller and flow down forward and forward easy there is a desire at a more open level i mean not sure on a tight level they're antagonistic, but easy, where their real desire is to harmonize this with that and that with this okay, easy from a bit deeper energies flow up through the system through the system a few attire and, from there down through the system feels a bit deeper if i hang out with it deeper than the floor ah [Applause], easy, easy, because of this more balanced harmony let's take a, little aside let's check a different piece here with that balance easy you are more balanced easy check your feeling how do you feel i don't know who are you let me think i don't know who i am but don't do that feeling here, because of the beats up and the beats down and the eventual harmony at a certain level, of the up and down things begin to feel different i who was uh disorganized what word did i use i use this conglomerate what word did i use uh status but i who was out of sorts and suddenly ah starting to get clearer i feel a bit better and that's what happened to me this week when i was actually out of sorts and i did this practice and feeling oh i feel much, better ah, a better sense of things better ah of things okay all right let's take a pause on that so i couldn't think my way out of that out of sorts okay i was out of surgery i couldn't find i couldn't catch myself i don't know i started this and, and feeling better i'm not in the out of sorts world i was suddenly, feeling better much clearer on what i do how things work uh it was really nice okay so it's interesting to do an old basic practice uh at this stage of the game and realize how important it is how useful it is right oh one of the dialogue like there are many ways again a lot of this is repetitive but i think important uh [Music] he's positive i'm receptive so let's say i'm out of sorts i'd say ah we're in the dojo brad give me a hand here for a while he's positive i'm receptive okay, see, you see you see positive receptive and i felt a little smoother so that clues mean that things are starting to settle open could i say easy, oh, yes, i was able to pick up him coming in positive much earlier than him crowding me, easy, well let me think about that let me let me let me oh guys i said you get them ahead of time and don't go that easy, receptive, positive receptive and after a bit because of the using the positive receptive pattern it's a simple balanced practice he's positive i'm receptive okay very simple practice i'm beginning to feel better there's more room easier the eye, a better sense of things theory comes and i can do other things a better sense of things other possibilities are showing here i'll call you in a moment okay thank you brad so uh you know when the uh corona thing hitting people could not go to the dojo and oh they were bitching and complaining that uh because they can't get on the mat they can't, they can't they can't okay i thought in one sense what a shame yeah i like the dojo but i'm not it's not the only way okay, i can have a imaginary partner who moves in and i step back if it's really good imagination it's the same as having a person there okay uh or you use other things uh, we got a baseball player that, strikes now the misunderstanding is i strike, instead of easy, there is a back wind up you call it that piece of it and that piece of it and that piece of it easy, because i really want to hit that ball at first easy, settle open there's a oh this back felt different there was a kind of a whoosh on the back don't study it to death not though easy back, moves forward and the forward felt a little i don't know equal fuller easy don't study it to death easy, back forth, easy let it happen easy, back oh this is a good one why i said it was good it felt like its back was really going further back not that i had to physically go back but i could feel this energy go further back, the forward of course is going out a little further if there was a ball with this bat i would have a pretty good trajectory, okay, so, batting tennis forehand backhand easy, forehand strike backhand strike easy you're using balance using forehand and backhand easy, so as the forehand backhand start to relate dialogue dance with each other i feel better i'm at a different level it's, aiding me to shift levels anytime you get that balance potentially you can move into a better level, okay, swimming a couple of you have swimming, a couple of you have swimming pools, uh, right stroke left, stroke, right, strokes, left strokes you hit the end of the pull stop there for a moment if you're going to play internally easy, easy, and then the next step go around stroke, stroke huh these strokes even though i'm just screwing around here the arm moved out a little further and seemed to um, seem to gather more gather more gather more now watch out oh that's it that's a trick i gather i gather and you just screwed it all up easy the eye eases the eye let these things go on then you can add to it and have your uh inhale exhale as you're stroking you boom whatever you do okay so you use that as your balancer if you're out of sort you go swimming but properly, with this stopping for a while at first easy, there open, let these things go on not getting caught up in how i can do it better, okay easy the eye easy get more space these things are freer to happen freer to happen okay so we've got let's do the pillow thing we did i think a week or two ago i like pillow throwing brad okay, i catch i catch easy, easy, throw, easy, catch, easy, throw, easy, catch, easy, it feels like it's starting to flow more both to catching in the throwing and throw easy, catch easy okay so dumb game but if you're out of sorts and you got a partner throw the pillow back and forth with that easy, see what level you can get with that, okay how both after a while improve uh, in that series my, thrower, positive side was a little bit better than my receptive side but they'll catch up after a bit if i continue to easy they'll balance out for example okay so you got tennis golf baseball going for a walk okay left foot right foot easy, easy, left foot right foot easy, gotcha can you hear me yeah come on out here a bit, closer she was on she's a strange lady she was on a 21 mile hike last week i think i would just want to see if she wants to throw anything in here let me continue for a little bit uh [Applause], i mentioned this story and it's a good time to mention it again i was teaching in, an energy awareness he's called the old days, workshop, with the people on the medical staff fort ord hospital it was after vietnam so they had a lot of patients who were traumatized by vietnam and they and once they got my drift they happened to mention that one afternoon they didn't know what to do with the guys they had a free afternoon and they said let's go on a hike now they weren't doing it for therapy they're just trying to kill the afternoon, they went on a hike i don't know how long or how far but it wasn't 10 minutes it was quite a while and they realized when the guys came back they were quote better things were different and they were kind of stunned they didn't know what the hell happened other than the guys were traumatized they go on a hike and they came back more present calmer, more there for whatever i forget all the little details but they couldn't figure it, okay, but, walking, i'm using that as an example of your balancing easy and you continue walking and you walk a little bit better left and right easy and you continue walking now i'll ask katja does this make any sense to you after a 21 mile hike you know what i'm talking about here yeah, help you help you, start to you you're struggling with all kinds of you want to come over here they may want to see your face okay now we have really a problem okay, i guess we go with that so um you start the hike you start with you're noticing things you're noticing things you're noticing details you, get to get thrown off by abide by things you might feel a little ache in the knee and, as you move you settle you settle the breath is changing you settle you get more comfortable and the eyes settle open yes and then you realize after two or three hours that little things that were bothering you actually you maybe still notice them but they are not bothering you anymore so you have changed into a different level where you can deal with that really, well, and i think also um you start processing things um things that are bothering you things thoughts that are in your head so i can completely see that after a longer hike that you come back you, you change the level you, where you move and move and, i felt that going through to this 21 miler, yeah similar to the yeah you change you change the level where you where you're operating from and it has a physical expression you feel it through your breath you feel it through your working style yeah through your body walking style and even the thought patterns even thought patterns especially thought patterns i think that because that's, that's, coming up and yeah, thank you thank you let's see so 21 mile hike for fun you people are weird, you gotta beg me to get off the porch jesus if i can park close to starbucks i'll give it a shot but boy, anyway, uh so, whether so anyway i, think at first i would really highlight that easy the eye thing to i don't know one to remind yourself you're doing internal work yes you're using an outside form but you're doing internal work okay, okay and that's where a lot of aikido people missed it even though sensei there they couldn't get a sense of this internal work so they continue to keep talking about the outer form he did his little finger up high no, i saw him do it with that finger up i know he had a sum of eyes jesus christ people what are you looking at, okay, what's this internal work what's going on in there that was important i would suggest that you remind yourself that's why i have you swimming one lap and stop at the edge, easy for him couple of moments whatever easy, and then let the body again stroke back and then easy okay i, think sometimes i like you know we get so busy doing techniques that we don't stop and remember again we're doing internal work easy open easy open and then and then and then back again easy open okay, uh, in the early days i used to do a lot more of that uh doing some kind of inner work and then techniques for a while and then back to the inner work and then techniques for a while i used to do a lot of that and do it now i should, highlight that at least for a class oh that reminds me in case i forget uh anyone interested san francisco i'm going to teach at the geary street dojo 1pm sunday the 15th of may which is not the day after tomorrow uh the next week sunday so one o'clock deary street dojo, uh, aikido class i haven't talked at the san francisco dojo for dojo for a couple of years i've been teaching a little bit in mountain view but not san francisco so any of you san francisco, so any of you san francisco people, ah, hope to see you ah okay ah okay so balance, balance uh so i think i'm saying if you're kind of ah find something simple to balance with okay, find something simple to balance with okay you got a backyard you gotta stick whop, easy, comes up it goes down easy, you're doing internal work don't get caught up don't higher heavy out there easy, easy this is just a reference of balance easy because of that up and that down easy, easy uh a susan uh chopping wood your susan are you on tonight yes sensei anything about that first simple beginning, acts up acts just with that centering sense the simplicity of that first piece you can say better than me i think well you put it really well just inherently the system naturally develops and finds its a sense of balance with that up down so there's a very natural progression of the balance a natural what of the balance the progression of depression and better and better sense of balance okay as you continue it up and down of the axe and easy the eye it does progress yes, yeah very naturally it's that's why yeah you like the way i said remember it's internal ease of the eye anything there to clarify i think you said earlier um as you're doing it easy the eye practice of and balance is sort of who am i who um not just my outlook but who am i in this balancing practice so what we're doing there i, i don't want to throw too many pieces at you but easy since there's more space and the eye is a little more at a better level easy the eye okay now we took a simple approach energies up and down easy and as the energies up and down get more harmonious you will begin to feel different better more harmonious, what she's bringing up is now let's have the, uh, uh, person on center acknowledge themselves, what's the phrase you're using who am i susan yeah who am i who am i [Applause] this will kind of refer to this when i go bobby and at a certain level bobby's not my right name robert after a while not my right name because, this is bigger and better nado okay anyway so we can fill it in what goes on here the energy beats go on and more a little more advanced centered and circle and circled and centered and at a certain level of harmony there who are you now and you experience yourself, i don't think about who i am let me think about that no, no the experience of who you are the experience of who you are okay so how does that level person plunk the guitar keys how does that level of person, chant or sing a few lines of that song uh how does that person throw the ball if ball throwing is your thing, how does that person at that level do knee kill so, we, uh i want a character there center circle are the energies the character so we want to uh i can't remember the words tonight but uh position assembly not the right word huh position i forgot words i'm using [Applause], squaring away balance huh, balance, balance, no, anyway forget about it's not, important, uh, got off on a little tangent there no i'm put on the head okay where are we where are we where are we bob yeah steve here uh you know early in the week not early i guess a day or so ago uh maryland was what i would describe as out of sorts a lot of issues at the office and so forth and i and i just had gotten the email of the title of today's uh workshop and i read the title to her and it immediately cooled her out and, yeah but what i'm seeing you know you know you see the title out of sorts and you think oh there's a condition there's a situation that's a problem and really what you showed us with the you know the up and down energy flow is what's out of swords is your relationship to your own energy, yeah good balance in some form we're saying hey people are a lot of forms, uh we could do better in the aikido realizing we're balancing the receptive positive thing are really to say use that really realize what you're doing with that a lot of people do the outer stuff but don't catch the anyway so balance, simple easy useful so if you're out of sorts find that simple i like the up and down beats i kind of very early started with that uh, i liked oh sensei's uh other form of doing that fire to the water, to the fire as they get more balanced a sense of steam that clues you in that they're balancing so if you get too much fire you burn the water away water away if you get too much water you just drown the fire there's not going to be any steam so steam is a reference for the harmony at whatever levels the multiple levels right uh, fire water, easy soon there'll be a sense of steam there okay better fire better water well for me better means for example the fires would like begin to show bigger hotter, and the water would begin to look like a deluge not just the shower water but a day load it just might sense as it got better and better the steam then would get better and better okay, uh so just a good uh sign for there's a certain amount of harmony there how do i know the steam really feels senses steamy and full, that tells me there's a certain amount of harmony there and then we can either continue or take up a residence at that level, who am i at this level kind of thing you okay with that steve sensei may i interject something this is sean, i, feel as if uh this is a this is a constant thing with me that you um there's this incremental uh, uh improvement um in an incremental uh, finer, and, you have utmost patience with that you have, you have distinguished that with incredible discernment the ability to, say this level this level this level and i'm, i, i, feel as if i'm a little bit on the um, what do you want to call it uh the slow slide when it comes to um yes discernment differences thank you thank you we have to settle a bit and be in a finer dimension in a finer dimension i discern better okay, now in your case i think we're coming into a problem of a misunderstanding of the underworld okay therefore it's difficult at first for you to get into a finer here and now where you can begin to discern i, there's a monster under there there's a monster under there oh, the fear of the underworld i think is what's going on okay so it makes it very hard you can't move into a finer dimension here you can do it here but that's not going to do the job okay, uh you can be aware of finder and read books about fine and stuff that's fine that's fine but we have to do this fullness factor okay, and to do the fullness factor we have to deal with the underworld which scares the out of some people all i can say is if you go sense that it's finer dimension it'll show its true nature, it's, their nutrients it's underwater nutrients i like the change of word nutrients wow, and because the better nutrients the plant center self the character the person so i think the discernment is, hard because you haven't quite settled enough into a finer dimension because we have to settle down into a finer dimension and you haven't come to terms with that yet so sorry to say in public sean but there it is and i'm talking to a lot of other people probably thank you sensei yeah anything, i don't know if i have anything more on balanced practices let's see i just said again aikido and then we just increase the size of it i'm not sure what we're going to do [Music], let's try this presentation okay, okay easy, easy, receptive end of it down up, positive, okay, so the picture's a bit bigger i wouldn't maybe i've done this on, at first i would have done something simple like one step good enough that's just to get things going you're starting to feel more present more easy, easy we're gonna get down receptive up positive, okay, so we just introduce a little more depth in our process okay so we've got left right we've got left right we have receptive, receptive, positive and we added a little more depth, easy, deep and from death positive from death from death so all we do is just open up i think good enough as we progress along we, open up as you're okay with one uke ah when they're doing a medium easy technique we throw in two uk's doing easy medium attacks, if you're okay with two you might throw in three uh because you're, starting to grow along with the situation, okay, kind of thing so there'll be a progression susan said it as a natural progression just in your centered and as you continue, a natural progression in the world you're dealing with so her natural progression i think was from being a wood chopper as she progressed she started to be very tuned into that piece of wood uh, cut on more of an angle there's just a sense of oh yeah cut it on an angle or something i'm not using quite the right words but she decided to include other things not just the hitter but the wood also was brought into the game in a certain woods you have to hit a certain way for it to split okay kind of thing did i say that all right close enough ah where are we anything, you got the sense of pain is mark here from new zealand ah of course it is um we've been doing a lot of um centering grounding and um the thing that i've been noticing is um it's not so much surprising but it still kind of amazes me just how much the more you stay with it just how much else gets included it just things just get taken care of but so you don't need to go out to take care of those things they just naturally get included as long as you hang out you kind of really hang out um, with, your with yourself and your in the process that you're doing don't you don't need to go out just to keep improving that and everything else gets included it's, it blows my mind really yeah it's yeah it's some of the fancy word synchronicity which always happens that people on the journey oh my god that was perfect timing for that to happen you know if you think about a book or something somebody hands you the book here it's a gift for you and it's what you're looking for whatever you know so, yeah as you get better the as the center gets better the circle activates and, you start to get harmony between those two that are just naturally happening synchronicity which is the word we use there, yeah, so, yes, yes, anyway good and again be careful of being a drawn out too much or something uh something happens and, uh i tried to show it here we were doing i forgot something uh and uh oh where you jump oh i got the answer because as you were as i was batting i noticed there was a little deeper back oh that's it you go back and then you hit but i went back it's not the back of this level going back, yeah, yeah and i potentially screw it up it'll stop working it might work for a few but then it'll stop working and you say well that was or i must have made that up that's a fantasy when no you were right on it but you took it over you came back to a lesser to take this over and you're back at a lesser kind, you get so excited yes people you have to be an alert here i think we're going to be finishing earlier tonight quarter of here, anything before we finish up yeah it's mike from new zealand sensei hey mike as opposed to mark yes well there's mark in this mic yes um well look at me i have fun with the new zealand people sir it's all right it's not it's not a problem um the other weekend i was at our anzac day commemorations which is our annual um remembering that the fall and the in the wars, and that i was sitting i was trying to sit down somewhere the only place that was available was um on a rock and of course the rock isn't designed for me to sit comfortably on and it was excruciatingly painful actually um, but what i what suddenly came to mind was, this practice basically and i and i had never it never occurred to me before for whatever reason to use the practice of just centering and, and settling and aligning um and then noticing so not, hooking on to but just noticing that in fact there was much less discomfort even though i was sitting on something that was inherently uncomfortable as soon as i allow my attention to go towards the fact oh it's not so painful no, no, that's going outside again and having to bring myself back yeah um and yeah i found that a really useful exercise yeah really good that's all then that's an old, style teaching tool to put your students whatever in pain so they sit through the pain what you're hoping for is to get to a better level but a lot of people just take it as taking the pain period but there's a deeper meaning there yeah, yeah and, i did notice that in fact as soon as i stopped the practice i was in pain i hadn't magically made the pain go away but you know i've done something within myself that meant that my body was better aligned and therefore i wasn't experiencing the pain in the same way yes so a lot of things depend how we see them how we deal with them at depend on the level we're at weird bobby doesn't deal with very well okay that's that level another level i can cope to a certain degree with it but don't push me too far kind of thing at another level much better yeah so it's that same pattern you see what level are you at um you know yes the world is crazy read the newspaper, no crane is getting a little crazier i mean things are costing more every day there's an extra dollar here and an extra dollar here and, oh my god they're going to do something with the with the law bro row and whoever oh my god and, they won't let up what level do you want to be at in dealing with that because you can get caught up in the insanity of it if you like doing that feel free but it's like the hard rock you can settle and get to a better level your perspective is different your choice your choice just a couple of simple tricks to learn your choice i think good enough for tonight short one ten minutes thank you very much sure thank you for hanging out with that story thank you so much, okay thank you thank you for this evening sensei thank you thanks everybody thanks essay and thanks very much to the team for making this possible sweet ass see you

what about timing here should we put our shakahachi music on again, absolutely, do we care you want to grab one or i got it go for it the timing here what's the echo oh that was youtube starting up yeah i mean are we good yeah no music lauren that do it yep so um wow [Music] we lost the music lauren [Music], there it is [Music], [Laughter], [Music], [Laughter] [Music] bob noah can you hear me yes um, just uh, just uh, on the chronology text that we're working on altogether yes i just renewed the latest one from the lane the lane okay if you have any updates to that i'm going to print it out you know tomorrow morning and uh i don't have any of those dates hard enough story i wish i did do you have any other questions no any other missing pieces anything that you want, us to no i, think it's very good and, i wish i could contribute those dates but i just don't have them well i'll try and get them from, jack and sensitive, okay, all right yeah now i reviewed it uh about an hour ago and it looked good okay, all right all right very good so [Music] [Laughter], [Music] do [Music] [Laughter], [Music] so [Music] [Laughter], [Music], oh, [Music] um [Laughter], [Music] so hmm good evening everyone and welcome sensei's ready to go so uh as soon as he turns on his camera we'll be ready to go good evening sensei hey thank you thank you uh before i forget remind me at the end of session uh next weekend is the fourth of july weekend, so we'll take it off in case you have a long weekend plans okay, carry over from last week or whenever insights experiences questions hello out there sensei this is justin i, i, noticed this, week that um when in various situations that would take place throughout the week um there would invariably be um a moment would arrive where it seemed like self became more present within the character and um the way that i, felt that i was positioning myself within the character became in those moments of fuller somehow or um my sense of character in a situation would, become more um i don't know solid or, present in a way a sense of things that it wasn't quite as uh as solid or tangible as it had been the moment before there was a more of a fullness to what was happening within me and my situation in that moment yeah i did we lose you yeah you finished there okay ah yeah kind of a good basic uh situation, uh, comes along and the center he's picking up a little bit more he's saying about self-end the character uh and the character present better in that situation the character fuller and uh yeah, thank you if we can explain what brad is playing with, let's give it a shot uh bread is very keen naturally on center okay, but in watching him in the aikido class i would for a long time be seeing the center was sort of not in proper position with the situation, and i kind of didn't know what to say so he's catching on that uh to acknowledge there is a situation and then the center whereas before he would just center uh, but it got out of context with the situation he was in something like that bruh is that pretty close so he's having fun playing with that uh giving the giving the situation a moment acknowledging the situation would you call it a merry-go-round thing yeah, looking at it like a merry-go-round and, then the center that naturally will develop because of the situation so he's moving along with that ah, be interesting see it's showing up on the uh with the aikido techniques anyway somebody i was on a road trip to visit family up in the hills uh so i'm still i think on the highway scattered so please somebody some carryover some insight some experience some questions from previous weeks that's sensei about here yeah one thing i really like is how the two sessions came together in the sense that the kind of slow experientially based process of going through the could you remind us the two sessions what we did what we did for me because i forget him very fast yeah we did what second session we did what second session we did what and then go first session we worked with the process of going through the membrane or the wall from level one to level two okay and slowing it down and all that slowing it down okay and then last week we applied basically the same practice to the to the initial experience when you reach that finer level the thing i liked about it is that it was the same process in both cases yeah a lot of things throughout our manifest creation good tricks of the trade sorry by phrasing, are, repeatable if they're good they'll, show up again at another level and repeat so it's not like you have to learn a brand new trick for every dimension or something uh certain tricks certain, help me with the word pattern certain things you do you just keep doing you know, so uh so uh easy at the border and then and then starting to pass through into a bigger space, you know what's going on i gotta be aware easy there easy so it's just yeah easy it's a good and that goes on for a long, time through, manifest creation and continues easy, let it unfold let it show itself don't be don't be so fast to jump easy you're not in the third grade and the kid who gets his hand up first is that is the best kid in class we're not in the third grade easy, kind of thing so yeah is that is that what we were talking about bob is that okay yes exactly so the, pattern goes a long way once you get it you can continue it and it goes a long way yeah, and the different kinds of patterns i think i mentioned uh for example on something with dimensionality border uh talking about uh at one time i hit a heavy death feeling, at a border and i wasn't sure if i was actually gonna die it was that strong so i'm fairly new at the game here but as i but as i continued gambled i continued to go hoping i wasn't actually going to die but, what the hell let's go okay uh okay uh and then i noticed as i uh as time went on and i would hit different borders uh that there even got to be uh there's still a death thing but it got to be real just a quick second sense nothing scary but just that just a quick sense death oh i'm at the border oh moving into the next dimension so that death, of death continued it just got lighter the first one was heavy duty again i didn't know it was really going to get me you know really uh but it was lighter and quicker and oh yeah that it was a it became a road sign okay so okay so uh i think we asked you it remind me bob did it we asked the folks to notice their style of border because it's probably going to repeat yes, yeah and as you just described it when you do that you get better and better at it and it gets faster and easier yeah but it's still sort of like a continuation yeah all kinds of things like suddenly you're in a new space and i don't know okay easy, and then there's an experiential knowing and you move on to the next one and it'll be i don't know again it's like oh that, one again that always happens right here easy did not do that so i don't know i don't know i don't know maybe one for quite a while because it's sort of again a road sign tells you where you're at oh that one again i meant this relationship with it something yeah and on and on so uh so recognize your own stuff i guess we could say somebody i'll ask something that's okay sensei okay it's dusty that's okay um yeah i guess this is like warning signs i think one of the systems i might go is like i think it's like center right away but just for like a tiny little moment then i like to go out like a couple and then i like to go out here and then like taste something get it and then come back okay let's go over this again slowly, for me first word what you know as far as i guess um referring to what we uh first, is first is i feel like it would be my center but i don't like to stay there for very long before i like to kind of bounce out a couple a couple i don't know if it's a dimension or a level or a space and then and then come back in yeah, okay i think people in that case uh and we might cover that a bit with this vortex spiraling kind of sense uh let's not try to go for center let's easy let's easy settle easy not going for anything just settling if that's something easy settle open ah when there's a little sense of oh i feel more hair or something to let you know you're a little more present your breathing change you can feel your ad on the chair or in this case my feet on the floor, i notice my breathing wants to change into a better mode of breathing that tells me i'm a little better here at that feels pretty good to me then i'll go and now next the space the space then it should begin to show the center in the space and the circle so you jump from center and i think you get pushed yeah, so easy set it up better set it up better, yeah i don't know if i said it great but i didn't say it too bad that was good perfect thank you yeah that's good remember i think your style of being is to jump for things easy, easy we'll go through these things okay, uh, some see sometimes i have to be very careful of talking about advanced things you know like a more original self and somebody like oh wow that's important i'll jump for that i'll have an idea about what's an original self and, then they were near there they haven't set up the pattern properly uh, so i, don't like them you notice i jump on you if you throw out advanced words uh where people get an idea about it and think they got it because they got the idea about it and they haven't done the setup they haven't gone through the, layers the layers uh they haven't experienced enough or something now again if you're the fast kidding class you don't want to do any of that you just want to oh yeah i want to go for that easy, let's set it up properly so that the rest of the journey for like the word developmental journey the awareness developmental can proceed properly something like that hope sensei this is tisha i know you haven't introduced the theme of the night so much yet yeah not yet but, i, have a sense then of the connection between what noah was talking about and what you spoke about earlier when you're talking about, uh the uh the slowing down at the border of a of a transformation into another level and then just being present and, so, those themes really seem to be connected with the sense of, tonight's theme as well they're all part of a continuity so far so i'm appreciating uh, the uh the fact that the, slowdown is an important aspect and you know you you've said this many times in aikido we often do a lot of the training exercises too fast you know like whether that's cutting or doing uh even basic tai no hinko or something like that in aikido that we often rush through the sequence uh just to get our four cycles in and then and then go into the next stage and a lot of great learning is um is missed by, not being present so slowing down and being present i just wanted to acknowledge those uh aspects of your teaching that i think are so vital and that are often missed not only in aikido but you know in, music and life performance in, anything that you can probably name that's a developmental process of learning, so just yeah i don't think historically whether i've been talking to a bicycle racer guy or a, tai chi teacher guy uh a tennis player or skier well whoever, i, didn't have to really change a lot of things kind of the basics first let's easy settle and then i would see where the system was it fully there properly but it was first that settling in that opening yeah so i didn't tell the bicycle as well bicycle for 30 miles a day instead of 25 or whatever no, no, no, no and then the aikido detented well i want to be more active out there and do more well the more it really should be an inner more an inner development which will naturally show out in the outer but don't oh is it showing yet they jump the gun again wait inner development outer manifestation potentially yeah that's such a beautiful and important teaching and, so much uh is a in learning you know i can i can think about music uh we can think about aikido it's a you know the, learning process is a lot about the repetition and there's a certain amount of repetition that's important but without the inner qualities that you're talking about, you use you can spend you can spend years, you can waste years of time just doing more and more repetitions yeah so i think i can make up a practice here for example uh let's say ah it's my music or my art or something ah, now i want to be good at it so i say it ah and i say and i say ah and i say again ah and i say again ah and i say again ah okay maybe you'll get a little louder maybe behind this my breath will improve a bit so i can hang on to it a bit a bit so i can hang on to it a bit longer but if you really notice it's not really improving ah okay easy settle from that's more settled level and that more open space than that ah, it cracked a bit but it shows that a little different tonality too easy settle better level now it could be on and on and on wow, where did that come from at that better level a lot of people will buy that they stay with the ha ah, let me say it louder ah i'm developing ah sensei where's my next rank sorry people it's my dig on the aikido people, uh, bro thank you i'll get back to you guys okay all right should we try to shift into whatever sure fourth thing manifest creation it's not the totality of creation okay damn the word it wanted to show more of itself the creation so it went from a lighter more original not the most original yet into heavier dimensions okay, so there's your vortex happening there there's your spiral happening there there's your spiral happening there okay, and then within that vortex spiral uh we got from finer bom, into smaller heavier okay and here we are in human condition so i make a joke if we didn't sort of put our brakes on and it stopped there we would have become ruined pretty heavy okay ah what to say there that was your call to do that we weren't forced to do that it really wasn't supposed to do that but apparently we got fascinated by the layout of creation and the dimensionality and that uh whatever heavier of things than we got drawn into it there's a painting around where you got i think it's a famous painting an angel up in clouds and he's it's kind of sorrowful he's looking down and these other angels are in this mud pile and they're stuck in the mire they're into quicksand, and he's like oh too bad uh and i think started like, that we kind of got sucked into this tighter space in a certain way the one word i like i don't know if it's a proper word but it's kind of like a trap like a lobster trap you get in and now, you realize wait a minute something's wrong this is too tight okay, you get this urge to develop somehow you get this some of us get this urge to move along in high school i used to say life as i see it that can't be anything if, that's it what i see i'm at level one bobby and i'm seeing the word on saying yeah is that it because if that's it i don't give a okay so that was a one of my beginning pushes, this can't be it must be something more going on here okay so remember that observation as a young teenager where am i going with that okay now some uh people will stay at their level their bobby robert level whatever their two by two level three by three level what whatever and it kind of gets stuck there okay but some of us have more of a pulling we say this is pretty good but i think there's more okay right so something is calling you for more, okay and some people have a stronger pull on that than others so be it okay uh talking to richard moon today and he mentioned that he says you know you're i forgot the words you use but your pull and the depth you want to go into this is much more than you know something like normal people or something sorry moving paraphrasing um i thought yeah and i don't expect everybody to be as crazy as i am for this for this but there are some people around who, want to move along a bit and we should if we're a little more advanced let's say uh we should be able to help them move along a bit and you'll move them one more click and you'll expect two clicks and they'll stop there and you'll feel sad but you got to let it go it's their call now others will be hey that one click was good what's the second click and some of them say now what's the third click because the second was really cool and then you work with those people and some of them will stop along the way and you'll feel sad about that but you gotta let it go okay you can't control them you know with that you bring them to water but you can't make them drink kind of thing yeah, okay so um so you're maybe not going to save the world right now but save yourself okay, we don't need more people in the tightness of crazy insanity we got enough people boxed in there the world is weird we don't need to add to that somebody should settle get into a little better level and then whatever from that level okay so let's say there's a fighting level i want to hit anybody anytime, to, i'm not as interested in fighting anymore, well that's a better level they're, not as tight crazy so uh, the more people we can get to ah get to a little better level potentially the better things can be okay but again we can't control the world, so as the wars break out and the diseases and the earthquakes and ah all that, yeah there's a lot of that going on easy, save yourself develop yourself in no sense i say that and one of those things that lauren shows us sensei sayings it's not to [Music], something other people it's too the purpose of aikido is not to defeat other per people yeah but to develop yourself defeat them or drag them into this no okay yeah i think maybe he meant not for correcting others is for correcting your own mind yeah okay there we go yeah that's the exact quote richard's more correct okay thank you richard well no actually that's a different one lauren and it's also correct it's very close to the same message so sorry go ahead thank you anyway i was hoping looking at oh there's two forms i use now this is not quite right because it's more linear but let's try to look at it that way this level this level okay so you might get a certain and those are dimensional those, dimensional okay but again it's not quite right because it's too linear the overlay factor is closer to the truth but i thought uh have a sense of the linear or, the sense of the type, the half by half space the one by one the two by two to three by three or else as well since they would say don't go anywhere it's here but it's dimensionally ever finer here okay, okay, so whether uh i, just thought by seeing the vortex crowding in thing and it's reverse beat if you would back to finer and finer and finer uh, to look either at that circular style or this linear style you get your own sense of it so whatever, that means whatever i say okay where are we so let's say there is this vortex, okay, looking at the push part of it tighter and tighter and tighter uh for me for me in the push part to try to uh get squared away or centered i'm pointing at yes i'll be there a little um because i'm still caught up in this push so i'm playing with just acknowledge there is a vortex acknowledge there is a push okay just acknowledge i it try to do anything fancy in the push because the push is how can i center properly and stop it's pushing me all over the place but just to acknowledge there is a push and as soon as i acknowledge it then, now there is an inner space okay i'm not trying to make the spiral stop the spiral is that's that the vortex spiral is that something to do with the creation of the manifest okay i don't try to stop it [Applause], i acknowledge it and then start to the bad word focus on this more open space easy this dimensional space you see this dimensional space okay, so this quieter let's say or more yeah quieter more peaceful calmer space it's got nothing to do with the vortex right now that's the vertex that's that this, is this is this easy, okay, and in this, this space, we get don't reach easy and the energies i think we went over this last week the energies will start to formulate don't know the word formulate uh and they'll be centered energies and acknowledgement of a circle, the center, circle and you'll be a character there okay character and eventually as we get finer and finer the self that's there but kind of he's kind of shrouded in by this tightness so hard for the self to show itself be clear speak clearly but you've got the character who is i don't know a rep for the self for a while okay and as the character gets finer as we move into uh, the next level of dimensions or move upstream so to speak uh, the character will be better okay and eventually the self really can begin to show okay oh where the hell am i uh, anyway just a sense of a sense of a vortex, uh, i'm sort of asking is, that going to help you out any i, i have i, have maybe i, could say to you okay you okay let's say we're all in a vortex boom bank we're all in the vortex uh, especially this one that pushes tighter just keep it on one might be a little easier, you, people do you have any sense of how to recognize the vortex how to know when you're being vortexed help yes i, for one i feel um a sense of being wound up and, more agitated um as the, pressures within my two by two or three by three have reached the limit of the capacity there i feel wound up and at my transitioning there's an unwinding as i settle and open and to be more present with what's there and i'm like for me a change of words i might say wound in wound in yeah although we speak wound up but i for, for me right now i wound in so if you catch that, i'm going to call it a force that's going on would you agree with me right there that to try to stabilize when you're too involved with that is quite difficult yeah 100, yeah and that's why i'm playing with the sense of just to recognize acknowledge it we're going to do anything with it we're going to say stop, you know you're interfering with me finding myself here oh yeah this is this and then a percentage check am i still involved in that or is my percentage high enough with this that's calmer a little bit lower uh somehow finer in whatever form you pick it up and, then the character it's going to get mixed in there i think there's any validity to that yes a hundred percent okay also a settling and opening more fully uh, my sense experience of presence changes so it uh more boxed in level more wound in there's a lot more front focus and, a tunnel vision like but if i settle open more fully then there's a sense of back uh for example that may not have been there before all that stuff yeah exactly yes all that stuff uh yeah we're just playing i'm playing presenting maybe, the possibility of knowing there's a vortex acknowledging it might facilitate uh okay that's that and this is this okay because if i'm again caught up in that uh to ask me to get squared away to be a nice guy i'm caught up and, i'm kind of thing as you said are we getting anything out of this so far anybody am i screwing this up here so all of our first main work manifest creation is not the totality but it's the lobster trap that we're in and dimensionally work our way through whatever the right word is develop our way through there go finer and finer and finer through it okay eventually they'll be outside of the trap and we'll dialogue that more later you've heard me bring up the word domain, i bring that word up through and when you're through the manifest, there's a little something as a, prep space there for next that i call the domain or self that's uh not wrapped up so tightly uh really begins oh i'm, a self, so even though there was a self to some degree in this spiral uh we're not we're really getting a good shot on it because it because these uh in, the spiral these tighter, tighter, tighter things are there as we follow our process they're not as tight and the ropes become strings the strings become threads and then whatever is finer than thread and, boom you have a potential of moving out of this manifest trap into the next piece, that i call domain and we'll get into that another day okay uh, now again because i threw the word out because you sort of have an idea of it you can't say oh yeah i exist in domain you can't do that people there has to be some experience some experience when you really catch it yes there are fast forms because you've been it's true stuff experientially and one day we might present a fast form but i can't i guess and try to present anything like that right now because people understand it and think they got it and, and it'll just screw them up the way the, right creation works they'll just get spun off again and again and again, and again so i'm really careful on throwing out advanced fancy words and if you notice i jump on you throughout two fancy words we're not ready for that fancy word yet we're still in here using a word that you heard okay here i am in this size and, and i hear uh but god said you were a perfect pure being oh i'm a perfect pure being no you're not you're, bobby stop it but you can develop into that i'm, i'm on a tirade here help stop me before i, speak more speak more where the hell are we i'll call in my helpful agent mr noah we're working with a process that has a couple steps the first one is recognizing the vortex and then not trying to wrestle with it or subdue it or function better in it but, take a moment to relax and shift your, attention from the vortex to relaxing and opening a little bit a little bit just to get a little space yeah, so you're not trying to do that in the middle of the vortex you're acknowledging the vortex so we say it that way yeah you're acknowledging there's a vortex and, and you're acknowledging shifting your focus whatever the right words are i, don't like shifting your focus because it means i'm looking at i'm aware of it so i don't like that but it's words we use shifting your attention that you say that pop shifts your attention to, this, yes, yeah, okay and then uh we've covered how to play with this next set you know you're in a three by three now what easy and even though self is not showing i might just acknowledge to myself and there is myself here just to acknowledge it so when i'm at a finer and finer and finder himself is there whoa there it is kind of thing yeah i'm talking too much go ahead bob anything else on the vortex setup, well it the other thing is if the pattern in some ways is similar to the one we talked about earlier when you're going through the border and then appreciating the early stages of the next level next level the pattern you're describing with the vortex, you can keep doing it and get even finer and finer more open and so on i was just hoping that in saying there is such a thing and to acknowledge it i don't know how much you have to experience the vortex you know whatever uh but just to acknowledge the idea of it just acknowledge that yeah probably something like that yeah and that's that easy i'm shifting from that to, this, [Applause], to this to this [Applause], inner sensing whatever, whatever we do there you go anything more about i'm waiting for more well it's just what i said a moment ago that the pattern you just described and you just modeled for us can, take you a long way but you have to take it a step at a time as you were saying and make the practice experiential anything to say about the vortex sense just this, layout is that clear enough that there's this thing tighter and tighter and tighter and lighter and lighter and lighter and lighter and um this you're kind of explaining the, law of vortexes, how they function and their nature and when we talked about it the other day you pointed out that sure warts you know vortexes and spirals occur everywhere once you start looking for them but it's not everywhere in nature everywhere in nature every yes everywhere all over the place want you once you said is this important and you suddenly see that spiral in this fire and whatever, yeah it's, kind of a primary way that energy and form manifest themselves in our world or you'll see it all over the damn place people yeah okay now i want to add to this now instead of majoring in that's somebody's job it's not my job majoring in the different vortexes of the world and you may even do a picture book showing the water vortexing in the, tree, spiraling or whatever uh yes uh yes endless possibilities in our earth world setup, okay at this level people human whatever level now, i don't want to stay there and just keep majoring in that i want to go okay what's the finer of that what's the what's the finer of that what's the finer sense of a vortex i want to go dimensional with it to keep studying and be an expert on that is somebody else's job i don't think it's yours i don't know about you but i don't think it's yours it's not mine, okay, it could be one reason to keep from the actual inner experience is well i gotta study more now they're going to mars i gotta go to mars and see how if martian vortexes are different than earth vortexes and ah that's somebody else's job so and they're pretty, both with pretty pictures very nice so one of the things that i discovered in aikido was the experience of vortexes in a visceral dynamic real-time way and, like you said and noah said a minute ago to acknowledge the vortex it's a kind of a variant on circle and center but, they all have a calm center and, i discovered through my own practice that as i experience the vortex if my center opened the vortex of course revolves around but the center becomes calm, [Music], and this is consistent with the natural phenomena of vortex but it turns out to be the same function the same dynamic on the inner process of vortexes as i experienced them and so again okay yes okay yes uh so yeah it should be about okay, or, the boom spiraling out boom and to continue into a finer dimension and see how that spiral vortex whatever uh i think we're using vortex and spiraling two different ways here but how that manifests from that finer level okay, so me personally i only stay with a certain level of it i'll get a kind of a fair feeling about it not years just whatever five minutes five days whoa and then finer following that technique, but finer now at a finer dimensional level, how is my system doing that technique okay i don't know if i said it well but i i'm completely, agree and, uh and it leads directly to sense of presence that the, acknowledgement of the vortex and the responding calm in the center leaves, this my system with an enhanced sense of presence and space and all the other dimensional qualities that, we talk about, and so and so this dynamic of the vortex and its calm centers, you know in my own experience so, powerful, uh is processed so yeah that's all i have to say alternatively i'm not sure about a boss are we going to confuse the word vortex with, the spirals that, occur at better levels, i think that could definitely happen sensei and you're using the vortex in a very specific way yeah sort of the big outline of, what created this lobster trap right now within the lobster trap then we can get spirals and all that kind of stuff so i'm not sure if uh lauren i'm just not sure right now if i would use the word vortex for those techniques uh i might call them energy spirals and at better levels they spiral better or whatever, but i might want to keep the vortex as a force that is more involved with the lobster trap, i guess what i want to say sensei is that, you're, you're explaining the lobster trap using this vortex metaphor and, i, really like that and i and one of the reasons i like that is it's a consistent metaphor to my direct experience then i got practicing aikido dealing with these other forces as you described so uh, i just wanted to share my yeah i've got no problem here lord no problem i'm just not sure if people will confuse, spiraling things with, vortex in which i'm trying to lay it out that's why i threw the question to bob who's a little more intelligent than i am to see uh i've gotten lauren i'm fine i'm gonna get out of the way okay i just try not to do anything that might overly confuse other people i don't mind confusing them a bit to shake them up so they, move along but i don't want to confuse them too much if i can okay and i won't be able to control that so, be it anyway uh tj we playing with the vortex thing if you wanna lay out your sense of vortexing here sure um it's, very interesting as i as i said earlier the connection with um, with being present which is what we did the, last time and then slowing down a vortex in, this way seems to be what you sometimes refer to as a travel vehicle, or it is potentially a gateway to that fight to that finer dimension and it's not just a lateral movement it is a fluid it's a has a fluid sense it's moving could i say let me jump in a sec because you said travel victim that were oh god i just lost it that were uh using how it works to facilitate traveling through, i think it i think it was cool yeah i think i said something cool anybody taped that i think that was cool, that's all you sensei yeah we got it uh yeah so uh yeah so uh um, it's interesting in the dynamics i mean kind of to lean in a little bit on what no both noah and lauren were just saying the dynamics of the spiral is there are some interesting pieces about that it's like being in rushing water in a certain way i think justin was talking about that maybe dustin as well you know like the intensity of moving into or at the borderline of a new dimension and it's like, being in rushing water if you fight it, uh you can go down but if you can relax into it then you might move more towards the center yeah i'm just talking about dynamics of spirals here but um using that as a as a way hopefully and again let me jump in i think i think i'm trying to get across that, if you're if you're overtly caught up in this room, uh vortex uh vortex uh not to try to suddenly find your center or find your sanity or something it's like just acknowledge it that's the force yeah i like the acknowledgement and that's kind of like i don't want to say let go but i do want to say there, is a way of way of let go of your heavy interest in it yeah something like that you know if you fight the water if you fight the if you fight that spiraling movement you're going to be pushed towards the periphery and i think what you're pointing to and what uh everyone who is talking about the experience is that like as you relax and move towards the center you are moving more towards the calm and that is something that we've been practicing with uh you know forever yeah, so that's uh that's jumping for a second uh, noah you might remember better gene mcgregor story she's at the beach with her brother they go on the water but there's a fantastic undertow or something her brother drowns she's fighting the currents there and i believe my voice came to her easy or something you remember what she said that's exactly what you said is exactly it did she, was fighting the current, and starting to get fatigued could have gone under like a brother who'd actually died as a result and she went with the flow and then this allowing it which brought her outside of those drowning currents that's right so she was all right her brother was dead unfortunately that's what happened yeah i think part of sensei what you're describing with the vortex and its effect on us is an immediate experience of what happened at the dawn of creation when the dynamic forces of creation and we didn't we didn't align with them properly and we got sucked in and became apes and maybe rocks now he took a big jump here he's to the beginning of creation starting to get past my paid grade here people uh so beginning of creation and well you talked about that earlier in class, that we at the very beginning we didn't um, interact with the creation properly and we got sucked in more and more and more my understanding is if you were to hold yourself properly making words up as, your, self-consciousness hold yourself properly, that the that the creation of the heavy stuff the vortex stuff the lobster traps up you would have been aware of that but you wouldn't got drawn into it so there's the difference we, lost our fullness, now our fullness is still there but i'm here bob is that the prodigal son story that this drunk here finally works his way back and he's given all the gifts of his brother who never left does that fit in here you talking to the sun story yes that's correct yeah does that make any sense anybody so proper extrication and, i don't know how much to throw out but there is a level uh that uh that more fully more fully holds itself and purposely will not get caught up in the trap again because it knows better can i say it that way it's a little bit past my pay grade but i'm doing the best tj back to you vortex that's, essentially it is, a feeling that uh in the connection of the of the teachings and the experiential process that we're going to it through in, this process of transformation the one by two by three bias a transformational process and we're trying to make it uh accessible you know we're using we're using some cognitive sense in learning but we're really leaning into the experience of what that is so we use the, metaphor of the vortex or the metaphor of the membrane as noah was talking about earlier as a as a way of feeling into what it what it takes to uh to move uh dimensionally and it's like for me as a guitar player say, using that as an example you know when you when you fight the instrument and i don't fight the instrument so much anymore but when you when you fight it to try to make it do something it's you know it's a it's a process that, just doesn't go anywhere but it fights your back yeah, it fights you it definitely bites you back it's really you finding yourself back yes, but, when you can when you can let go the uh let go is not exactly the right word relaxation isn't exactly the right word but it's easy yeah it's oh good i should write that down easy uh, yeah it's easy it's uh relaxation is not collapse it is um what's that word that uh oh yeah that lauren was using presents it drops you into kind of a presence and there are levels of that for a performer for an aikidos for an athlete for golfer all those everybody, yeah we're all in this thing in our own way yeah, so the vortex is it can definitely be um a challenge and if you know some of the dynamics that we've talked about here then you can acknowledge that and uh do be present in, the inner work again what seems to be nagging on me all the while is uh let's make these lines a little thicker it's just to acknowledge that there's something, that's a great force it created all manifest creation whoa okay indeed and, i want to make sure and it seems like again i'm going to say by just acknowledging it's there i didn't say get in and experience it but just acknowledge there's such a thing okay just like knowledge all the while i'm starting to easy and center and i'm getting into say a calmer place here yeah, and there'll be a and easy it'll mix up a better character after a while you realize in that same next space there's also a bit of self that's their space experiencing itself a space yeah character experiencing itself as the character not just aware that's my word experience, yeah eventually self gets to show more and more and more because in the tighter it's kind of tight up kind of can't really show itself could i say but in the finer and finer it starts to hey, hey it starts to show itself or sort of let you know something's here well absolutely and i think one of the beauties of that is um is the functionality that begins to show itself when, the more original self as you as you put it uh has a chance to show itself yeah um so there is there's both uh, capability there's a there's kind of an innate, intelligence it's not necessarily cognitive intelligence it can be any of the various lines of intelligence the body intelligence the empathetic intelligence you know those kinds of things that that's what's that's what you're pointing to for me is that in the transformation process when i settled when i settled down say in the in the guitar the, the harmony that begins to take place, is, expressed in beauty is expressed in, um, in, vitality expressed in the glow explain yeah, yeah, those things yeah so again as we, move into finer dimensions of two might a three vital four by then these other things begin to show uh you use quality words there the beauty begins the show yeah uh the more alive begins to show uh whatever, so, yeah uh yeah thanks that's great wonderful beautiful teachings great teachings see i started my diverging too much uh had you at whatever level you were at six months ago whatever say what quality is natural, for you easy, often there's a quality that's just there and when it's there, and when it's there you, feel better somehow or each other it's just so natural for you and it shows fairly often it's like it's your quality and i asked people to tell me what it was and we got pretty good response there yeah where i'm going with that we'll get back to that is you have more than one quality okay i've been mentioning that asking those people that pick up a quality don't forget to pick up its partner it'll help you stay more balanced along here okay, so that's two of them uh more and more and more you'll be able to pick up four of them okay so in finer, finer where am i going with that um a teacher you alluded to it that when a self a better selfish is there that the better character player or whoever, did you say that i did yeah i did it uh it, uh it the interesting thing is it's it is kind of a natural process but you have to be in it that, aspect that you noted earlier of acknowledgement i think is quite important it doesn't necessarily just spontaneously happen to be to be a good artist of any kind an aikidos or a musician takes some practice and that does take some repetition but the depth you know what, what differentiates a yo-yo ma from a beginning cellist is the is the presence of self that is just radiant through the guy and uh and it is then it's it, radiates also uh through his music and through the very tones that he creates okay i may be speaking too much i don't i don't again like to throw too much but in the earlier layout uh self present yeah and then the energies that mix up the character that self is in relation to and the world he's in uh so self will take more of a i don't call it a dominance a first place so uh and certainly we're backing up into our backtracking, finer and finer and finer toward itself eventually it goes this way and itself is there and all this other stuff is just naturally going on so isn't that interesting about that isn't that so interesting because when you look at top-notch athletes or, musicians like that uh you, in a way in the way that we're talking about you could say that uh self is, more present is uh yeah even in the early stages i'm gonna pull this in i'm talking a more advanced level but even in the early stages when you begin to see some semblance of this inner glow of this core self or something you begin to get a sense of something else there, so yo-yo whatever that means for me it's a good example extra yeah something extra yeah don't they try to use that in, business uh oh he's mr showman or he's mister whatever to say he's not just a comedian he's the best of the best because he's got this extra thing so they give him that title mr whatever yeah or mr whatever, anyway, uh, so and again, i think to acknowledge there's such a thing and not try to do anything when such a thing isn't uh we're of being affected by it but just to easily acknowledge it yes, yes, yes, yes, yes and then you work the inner that's that now this is this i just thought again by sort of acknowledging it that it would make this inner part and its movement and if you bump into along your movement another phase of, that you know what it is and you go same thing you acknowledge it that's that and this is this and you continue with your inner best i can work there my diagrams are everything's a hello out there people any anyone following all this nonsense we're talking about uh sensei this is elaine um, what i am appreciating about an earlier discussion especially about um, the vort the difference between the vortex and, experiencing spirals in aikido or something like that is it the vortex isn't manifest it's going toward manifest is that right it's going toward density and the vortex itself is what it is and we, acknowledge that the vortex is what it is, and you don't try to change it you don't try to mess around with it it's just a thing it's or a law that's how it that's and because that's how it's made and it's the outline made up a word there outline then of course within the outline are spirals and stuff yeah okay but uh what i was uh worried about that people would say oh my spiral is the vortex that's like no this outline thing is the vortex and within the vortex following the pattern creation just keeps kind of repeating itself a lot me and bob we're talking about that earlier this repetitiveness thank god, uh, that because of that there are spirals other little spirals and finer dimensional spirals and finer dimensional spirals let's not call that the vortex would be my, uh sense so you don't get confused yeah, yeah, see because i'm asking people to acknowledge the vortex but not stick your body in it so to speak so spinsy, now if we say oh it's vortexing through me in the nike technique i think there might be a little confusion there i said no, that's the vortex this is what goes on in this space and if the space has spirals so be it but it's within the space character whatever, hello yes, thanks thank you yeah, yeah [Music], huh uh oh okay oh okay most of you should be on before you leave uh next week fourth of july weekend night out okay go ye play with your vortex uh somebody anything, anything, anything some questions are okay because we're not even sure what we're talking about so anything from you is fine sensei, no danny here hey danny there um i think uh last week before class as you know i'm i i'm my present life is it is pretty much about healing and getting better and so i felt like i had an intimacy with the healing self or self of healing and so last week i had this experience of touching healing self or touching me and then, i was asked a question it was do you want a boost do you want to have a boost like a boost of energy yeah so i immediately i didn't really my body said yes and, and i'm wondering now if, i was in this vortex and i was and i could feel this push a bit of a push in a pull and then suddenly, i was no longer with the healing self and i was with the caring self this the self caring one the following week that uh, maybe let's not confuse where, we're at so maybe we're on to something but i don't want to get too convoluted here uh the vortex let's say it's just uh how the lobster trap got made and therefore there are certain similar things within here but now we're within here and you are making a touch on saying healing self could you show yourself or something like that okay and then and then and then healing self said do you want to boost uh myself i would have said go for it and be very open and see that bad word a lot of experience okay so i don't have to confuse vortex with what's going on here this is the glow of self, if that's in fact where you were it's a glow of self yeah, yeah remember all along the way uh we've got these um core we got these cores and they emanate energies and we've got a finer corner that emanates energies through the body we got a finer core and eventually being realized core and self are probably the same damn thing at a finer level now you got self that radiates emanates and susan and i've been working in on the healing potential of itself aligning properly with their person okay with the person because they over and they're over there to the left and all over the place so we're saying hey guys you really gotta align okay and when you align because you're in your own way alive not the right word but you're your own way uh present glowing let's say you affect your person to develop better in whatever way they're supposed to develop in this life okay and it has a healing potential okay, yeah somehow danny phillips yeah so i don't think we have to bring the word vortex into your experience, that's some outer what, shape of the lobster trap but let's not confuse the inner stuff with vortexing but again if you run into a vortex wherever uh i i'm playing with the sense of maybe we can make it easier we just acknowledge there is a vortex you sense it you feel it you're feeling affected by it well then let's acknowledge it oh there's a vortex and that's that easy, inner, and this is this i i'm sorry i can't say it any clearer i just didn't want to get too convoluted there danny's all right and you're probably saying something brilliant and i'm too dumb to hear so hear so no, but um i don't think so no i think that you've added some clarity for me but um this following week from that time it's like i have had a boost and, so many amazing things have happened this week in, in my return to health yeah um and i and i recall you maybe a month or, so ago might have been longer that you, felt it was time for there should be a boost of some kind if itself is positioned better it has a natural because it's natural radiation a natural healing capability so yeah that's what i've wanted been wanting you to do all along so when i would jump you and you talk about the massage i love massage or the acupuncture, yeah that's cool no problem but for you i think we needed this inner self radiating because you're a hard case you got fu cancer fu cancer okay that's not a little stiff shoulder they can whatever okay so not to take away from assad not to take away from acupuncture not to take away from anything, but, those that can i always have a feeling danny uh danny self is close so i had a feeling he could more easily tap his self and have a position and glow healing like so i've been on you since forever danny i was on you a little bit about where you got sick on your back porch how many years ago was that yeah, yeah no thanks very much yeah, anyway fact in fact it it's while i'm saying thank you it's difficult to thank you enough for what, the um the um your persistence in, finding ways of thinking a pain in the asses is that what he'd just say yeah, something like that but um yeah, i it's hard, to find the words and i'm sure it's the same for all of us um our appreciation of you thank you lesser level but the gucci sensei saw an old sensei something and, was persistent and on his case and digging on him because he saw what was there, so again i always had a feeling yourself was potentially touchable closer so yeah whatever, anyway, people, two minutes here and we'll cut and run somebody something, we said that confused you no end that we could clarify maybe i wonder if we say the vortex is kind of like the world is doing it's getting tighter, right and crazier starvation earthquakes wars uh that that's that and this is this okay, unless you want to get caught up in that go for it get crazier okay, they need volunteers in what country ukraine, go for it that's your thing a little crazy to get crazier no you all know that so that's that easy and it's a strong force millions of people are being sucked into this, okay yes okay yes and this is this your call your call anyway, whatever thank you for hanging out anybody say i have a question this is andreas, andreas, andres yes andres yes yeah my question is this um it's about misogyny and i don't want to use fancy words but i think like um and i don't want to go as far you, went way further than where i'm at i mean yes so i'm thinking let's say you you're at the right i believe like once somebody's at the right part we were talking about the theory but i still think that even though everything is at the right, everything is right i, still think there needs to be this, what's oh since i was calling misogyny how do you do that miss soggy that cleansing of self in order to move to the next level like once you hold it right now stop okay, you don't clean up yourself to be a better self you start with your stupid self okay, and you go through the process easy and if you're present you naturally move into the next level where the self is a bit cleaner or the character is a bit nicer you don't you don't try to make bobby a robber to move into robert bobby's bobby now what we ask bobby to do is settle down and shut up for a minute easy, and bobby naturally crosses a border enters the land of robert that mixes up a robber oh okay so you don't have to perfect the you and you know round and round if you try uh reason i understand this one is because i went through that one okay, i mentioned the story once or twice i had a sense that or would have read something or something to meditate you have to be loving and i said oh i, i'd like to meditate i'm really called to do it but i'm not loving now instead of trying to be loving it's like i knew no way could i become loving this is that guy i said well let me let me play with this meditation stuff anyway and lo and behold, it brought me to a level that was more caring or loving i said oh that's how it works it exists it wasn't telling bobby to be loving he was saying easy bobby easy and the next and the next and it was more loving okay, yeah you got it yes thank you thank you thanks no because if you try to get your idiot level your one by one level i'm talking to everybody to, be better uh what a fight that's going to be okay you're an idiot because you're an idiot let's see if the idiot accepts he's an idiot okay and that's all settling easy whatever the game is for you you'll move into the next level and the mix there will be not such an idiot, okay and that one will move into the next one after a bit where, not an idiot moving to even the next one and i don't remember when i was an idiot and when you mentioned stories when i was an idiot i can't relate because i'm not, living from that from the idiot's face anymore, it, doesn't even exist in my memory hardly did i say that did i do that i can't believe it because i'm in this level now kind of thing so uh misogyny is uh realizing by going through this process that you are a cleaner clearer being you don't clean up your being bobby can't clean up bobby very well okay but you can start with your bobby of course start with your bobby and da, da it all work out okay, so i often make jokes about certain christian types and they're angry uh, i shouldn't be angry i, should be christian whatever and i think oh no you guys are making a mistake stay with the anger sit with it for a moment how angry are you could you throw up a, pillow a pillow could you uh throw a dish could you kill somebody oh no i couldn't go that far okay just establish how angry you are and let's continue settle easy next level now what is the anger so they had a nice line a nice highway set up for him by getting angry but they didn't know the trick of easy, what is it really okay i think when you're feeling angry and you say no i, can't i gotta i should be this it's like too bad you had a highway there you could have utilized that's the one i did when i make a joke and not really a joke and go out and kill something or somebody uh i was like i can't do that send me in jail i'm too handsome to go to jail i told you the story before i sit with it what the hell is that they go through different stages it's red it's volcanic continued and reached a place where it was just power but it didn't have a hurtful agenda it was just powerful no agenda to hurt that oh and i begin to wonder i wonder if every i know to call that quality uh emotional whatever, that does the same i play with a couple of others and lo and behold they follow the same pattern here, not so bad here not so bad here not so bad here really nice really nice whoa fantastic so, yeah, anyway blah, blah finish up time people, thank you very much sensei enjoy next weekend, okay thank you then good night everyone and no classes thank you everyone good night good night happy thanksgiving you sensei good night everyone good night laura okay over and out i

the efforts here so there's a number of ways i think uh we could look at this uh one way of looking at this of course it's voluntary but one way to look at this is that uh you know if you came to a dojo it's kind of a mat fee that you would pay to participate another way is if you were a visitor to a dojo and you wanted to take sensei out for a cup of coffee afterwards and have a coffee with him and uh buy him a pastry and a coffee that'd be another way of looking at donating and uh even if it was just a coffee something that you would just contribute uh for his time and effort and i know he puts a lot of time and effort into these teachings and to simplify his message as he's been doing for years i mean i've sat in cars with him for uh six hours at a time talking with him as he began to uh and continue to hone his message and his ability to communicate this practice and the process to us all so, anyway whatever you can do is really welcomed it is voluntary but thank you for whatever it is that you can afford and uh there'll be something put into the chat where you could uh click on and then go in there and uh and uh just make a you know a donation uh for this class as well as you know whatever other classes that you come to so uh thank you uh okay uh if you'd like to share looks like sensei's just about ready so if there's anything you'd like to share just remember to unmute yourself uh speak clearly and uh sensei really appreciates your participation sensei please thank you good evening good evening okay oh boy space, again oh boy before we get into that ah hi out there has anything from the last couple of playing, with space experiencing itself the more original of space uh, experiencing itself any, thing bubbling through on that during the week that was a question hi everyone it's justin i've been waiting all week to share this with you guys, so uh i had an experience that i'm sure you can all relate to this monday i went to the dentist for a deep cleaning and so i'm there in the chair and um you know little by little i'm, going into the experience of being in the dentist and i can feel uh my, body becoming a little uh tense here and there so at one point i decide remembering what sensei share with us to um to, just connect with the space i'm in so i say um hello, space and bring that into my field of experience if you will and, and then open up to, to being in the space i'm in my, sense of, tight agitated body uh unwound a bit and i, sensed myself merging to some greater extent with the space i was in and i was able to relax into the chair and i had to repeat that process a few more times but it was very helpful for me okay thank you somebody anything ah struck even more than in previous times with how intelligent space is itself not, what it can do not any just the intelligence of space itself yeah we kind of take the approach that because there's a great intelligence to the whole creation that every piece of it is intelligent at its own level but intelligence and we figure that's in everything so yes the intelligence of the space itself experiencing itself yes okay so okay thank you people anything you know for me uh to follow up on what bob had said i was walking out uh on my usual walk tonight and uh i noticed this uh raven that was over uh to my right that had this uh silver ball in its uh mouth and uh there's a bunch of ravens around it and uh it saw me and it i it was kind of wondering about me i guess so it puts the ball down watches me and as i continued on the way uh i looked back and i noticed that it then picked the ball back up and so you know what it what it flashed for me it was just that you know the intelligence of everything that's around us kind of gets revealed in the practice of opening up to space it's like all the communications that are taking place kind of behind the scenes, show themselves and allow uh us me to actually connect with it yeah uh so uh again uh i think you're right um starting from uh my two by two or robert level whatever anytime you get more room or space and we work it that way uh then things like roy was saying a more awareness easier to communicate with other things see better sense better feel, better more awareness of your surroundings and stuff uh, okay so that's a dot, style that's like a one by two a two by two a three by two a four by four or uh weird bobby's world no we'll go weird it's two here bobby's world yeah, robert's world there's already a sense of a little more space just in saying that robert's world oh i already feel a little more spaciousness now though's world ah i can feel it again it feels more open and a little bigger so that's starting from here going this way this way this way this way and uh so a simple trick a simple pattern um uh justin's notice i was getting tight so i said hey more space boom and then in that next space or two ah the body's relaxing and, untightening itself and all of that okay what we want to do tonight though is not go down we want to as quickly as possible play with space with a sense of an original space now because i right now say original doesn't mean there's an original space that or like the words i can sense okay but i might keep that pattern up easy original space a more original space so i kind of use that as a command a line just because i say it doesn't mean i'm, at that level okay, did you follow that oh okay, all right now when we uh play here with space uh basics again not the idea oh yeah space, yes, space let me think about that okay here and now here space more original space okay now at first we might have a, a body and as we begin to i don't know the word sense, it's body level sensing okay i'm not interested in body level right now easy, then it's the uh surroundings little finer there'll be the energy moving around in that i'm not interested in that level okay, saying it another way goldfish in the water bowl i'm not interested in the goldfish developing, right now right now i might take a moment and just start with him because here i am i'll be the goldfish or the water temperature how the water moves and it's hay and hoe and all of that stuff that stuff that's nice but i'm not interested in that piece the piece i'm very interested in is space itself okay here and now space itself are we okay so far with those words all, right yeah okay, well then let's, start space easy, now, space itself and then we begin can, is flavoring itself easy space itself is experiencing itself as space, itself see and again i'm probably easing the bobby goldfish and i'm easing with the water so that just the space itself can take the stage fully okay, i'm not interested in the actor i'm not i'm not interested in the actor i'm not interested in the what do you call the furniture on the stage there's a word no what scent are then the props, i'm not interested in the props easy the space the space the space okay easy so let's play there for a bit space inferring an original space i'm just inferring i'm not there yet whatever their yet means but the space we're interested in tonight is the original of space as close as we can get space here, circular space as space shows it's a bit larger and i don't know freer space itself then, the words and it's experiencing itself begin to not make more sense but have a little flavor of that happening here a more original space inferring hopefully soon the original space okay the original space it's a word itself it's experiencing itself space itself [Music] experiencing itself as space if you bump into what goes on in the space the energy activities and stuff not now okay we'll pass on it i want to get as big a space as we can get and early a space as we can get here and then we'll see about the development that goes on within the space but not the development movement energies now just the space period okay easy original space easy original space and it's experiencing itself i don't fully yet have a feeling of it experiencing itself so i often throw out the words knowing i'm not there but it keeps me going is that, okay space, itself it's its own thing it's a major piece of creation and it's its own piece space itself for lack of words that's flavoring better to me space itself more original, of space experiencing itself as space now for example uh i was starting to hear things like something i think it said like uh oh i'm very early okay that's nice but i don't want to get involved with that i want to continue with just space, uh there's something else i forgot already what it was anyway as we're playing this game of getting to don't know the right words getting to a more original space now you may bump into things on that journey i'm not interested i, i so noted but i pass on real fast to continue space just space itself experiencing itself a more original space or space in its original nature space, experiencing itself as space i heard another word and then i heard free, that's nice i don't do anything with it space itself in a smart original of space experiencing itself space getting a sense of our feeling of pleasantness there again i don't want to get caught up in those words yet just more space more space earlier of space the beginnings of space trying to bring you back a certain way to the beginnings of creation and space was one of the very early pieces perfect very early the creation process did we say space so that didn't get you thinking about stuff, didn't mean for it to ease him original space hanging out with itself experiencing itself as a space let's take a little pause here potentially we'll come back to it ah i'm kind of have a question of how would we know we know that we've reached our limit for the day of, space the more original space, the more original space okay is that a proper question how do you know you've bob you want to jump in on that one once you get kind of a sense that you may be there since the space is intelligent and it's taking center stage you can ask it is there more today can we go further back toward the origins the space will tell you no this is about as far as we go today or yeah there's more yeah and i might have that dialogue with the space sort of as a trick i'm saying the same thing you are but just change the words a little bit uh space you're showing yourself can we go more further with you as space easy space, space response based and i'm hearing there's more okay and i felt, the size it improved back here uh the space all around, the, back part back part improved and i don't know what to say it seems clearer more i don't know not yet open to whatever but something like clearer okay so that was a good little dialogue to have to have kept us going so when we weren't sure we did something too i don't know the word spark something sparked something or somebody here and keep it going yeah okay, anybody got anything else in that along those lines steve you got anything how do you know if you're reaching the outer limits of your of the space that's there for you today um i got uh i got uh more of that sense of clear uh, it just opened up more but, it had a real sense of yeah okay a teaser you on tonight uh sensei i think he's down with the culvert so he's probably not here yeah i, i knew i just didn't know if he was well enough to watch tonight hey daniel here danny yeah, um yeah this um i, found myself kind of lost in the in, space first of all especially as you encouraged not to attach to anything and um okay i'll hold it right there danny hold it hold it did the goldfish get lost in the space in that big ocean of space you see you see the space itself can it really get lost who got lost i got to keep a check on this space is that the goldfish talking i'm not sure i'm just throwing it out to you no, i think i think you're right the way you put that yeah slowly i, became really there was a familiar feeling to, where i was and, then the space was speaking and saying about it its self and itself knowing and that became quite a, really strong pushing into my chest and my, my posture lately has been really bad in my recovery and, it just my whole posture changed with this feeling yeah and, again, right there again, right there that's cool but i don't want to go back to the goldfish that the goldfish straight enough that the goldfisher was affected by that but yes but i don't care about goldfish i don't care about temperature of waters and how it weighs back and forth and in and out whatever uh so yes, yes but this is space itself so i'm aware if there's a little reaction or something but i, don't get caught up in it i don't want to go back to being a goldfish, i keep being a goldfish the space can't show it's really there kind of thing but whatever, okay, okay hopefully these are tricks of the trade okay i had a student once and uh she could click into space p as soon as you did anything space she'd be in this vastness of space it was so big was so big and it would scare her but it was a her she retained herself as goldfish and she couldn't cope with that big space she'd get the hell out of there come back to hear hey, hey, but i thought wow she had a talent she could go hey and it'd be this vast space there that was a talent, but, what she didn't ought to work with it what it was it would just show for her so big so fast that's a talent she's looking out there she just couldn't no didn't know what to do with the rest because she the goldfish would ah anyway yeah, this is nancy, um am i getting this uh sentence coming to me that says if here's intelligence then here can be experiencing here okay here with an h yes here yes here is experiencing here yeah i think good because i want to make sure we're not doing space as a concept out there kind of thing but it's, here okay here is exactly it's authentic that heaven is here well after heaven one of the early pieces is space and it's here, is here yes here's here okay yeah it feels generative that here and here experiencing here feels very generative creative okay now, now i again i'm not sure if, we right now want to go further with space but you see the forces are now starting to move in to the next parts of creation okay i'm not saying that's wrong we're all going to get there in fact i'll ask you to see what happens when we say this is enough space for me now what and then activity will start okay uh so you have to determine whether you're going to try to stretch for like a word stretch the space out go for more space whatever the words are here, space the more original of space if you're going to continue on that vein or if you say that's enough now what goes on in this space and then things will start to happen the creation will begin to unfold uh tj did a good job with that last week and how he laid it out laid out some, nice pieces there how, it begins to happen or lay out ah, we okay nancy thank you yes yeah let's go back at it okay so easy settle [Applause], okay continuing with the more original of space, aware of itself experiencing itself as space okay i'm hearing it say uh or i'm hearing uh i'm everything, everything okay, all right it's all space or getting close to all space getting close to the original of space then yeah i'm all space i, feel the whole damn thing i'm everything now careful doesn't mean everything there's other main pieces but the space itself getting fuller and fuller out space itself or early and earlier space itself, or early and earlier space itself uh could begin to say i'm everything don't misunderstand that phrasing there's a couple other places that may have popped up historically i can't remember i can't think right now because there's been some years uh but where you hear something and, that something says i'm it and you glom and say oh that's it the hell with everything else no when it's it it'll say i'm it, doesn't mean i'm everything am i saying this well and again space there is a finer more original i'm getting a hell of a lot of clearness and again i just note it and i move along that's nice and continuing earlier space more original space fuller of space i'll throw words out doesn't mean i'm there the totality of space, space in its totalness let's hang out and see if that sort of changes the sensor changes space itself is that my bird or somebody else's tv or yeah somebody's pros doing pro talk ah i, have a sense of um when you said totality, there's something resonated there and it felt like um a level of completion at the moment no, no not getting hung up on it just like complete uh here and now there's a sense of like a summation and, uh generative quality uh okay not getting into qualities yeah okay activity now yup, i hear you no i, i, took completely generative space completely, and, um, uh just uh just succumbed by that and allowing that to be, and being more spacious in the moment okay are you saying this is sort of your clue that you've done enough for today on space is that uh a threshold i don't think that there's i mean i think you could hang out with that one for, any time i'm asking about you yes okay uh yeah, yeah i, i'm getting no i'm getting more i would like hang out with it more i've got patience okay i, will do that longer okay all right and then again if i'm not sure i might try a couple of different words to see if, it responds yup, yup, and there's no words i can come up with get a response then i figured that's it for today yeah and then i'll do the second part yeah which is going to be what goes on in this space big quiet talking to me about something like it could look calm and quiet and kind of with the dark darker sense tone to the darker tone to it let's try and explain that to me right we'll let it go ah but any dark sense that this is empty kind of thing is not really empty as humans call empty it's a vast space and then click it'll start to uh the next part will start to lay themselves out okay i'm okay with those words sensei shawn here again how about how about just at that moment of reassembly, yeah are you talking about the activity that goes on in the creation no when, when space acknowledges itself and there's a sense of, absolute vastness, and, and then there's a sense of i don't know it's somewhere there's like a reassembling process happening right there it's talking about it's going to create soon you're starting to pick up the creation there the assembly how it assembles the character uh that it mixes up the assembly uh you're starting to get you're starting to get you're starting to get that part of it is what you're hearing could it not be just like a happening behind the scenes like, completely behind the scenes just like emanating from underneath possibly if you think so go for it aren't they got it for me right now it's getting past my pay grade okay who is it that created space the unnamable it'll be getting a little bit past my pay grade at the moment okay, to space to space, space if you can get more out of space with whatever you're saying uh, if uh sensing d you said something about deeper sensing deeper something more in the bottom then go for it and see if that facilitates more space being space it's yours to do okay yeah okay push space, space interesting sensation though people is in it just for this vast space here and now just space i don't know a certain way i'd be hard-pressed to come up words but it's an interesting again for like a word sensation i don't really mean that but i said something on this spaciousness okay, okay see what else sensei tell me he says it's cool if, you were to uh do this first because then when the creation uh starts to show how it creates, you kind of know how you'll pick up things that originally got you here to bobby robert nadeau whatever uh where, am i going to try to remember, how he said it by having a good space there like we're doing, then as things continue with the creation, okay uh okay uh because we've done space the uh assembly my word here the assembly the, energies mixing are much more balanced so by doing this space first as it comes back and starts the heavier of creation uh there's, much more natural balance there because you did the space first you have a sense of, that, how that could be that i aside you too much okay now very slowly let's say we've reached our limit of that, space, experiencing itself in space and now, the, next is going to happen easy within the space what is for like the words next so space next what's your sense of next in the space for example in my case i'm getting this it's much more than a live roy i think you used the word with me when i was with you on the phone uh, about all these little things do you remember did you say that or was that uh if it wasn't you roy it was steve what was that what, word did you use at this point here uh clear and unencumbered no a bunch of things running around like pixels are we talking yes pixels yeah pixels yeah a million all over the place okay yeah, yeah so my aliveness is showing like that but damn strong the pixels are like each one a diamond and they're just radiating glowing, kind of like i'm looking at one of the new pictures of space but just at the stars twinkling and it's like oh my god okay or a city person goes uh to alaska and gets a chance to look at the sky and oh my god the stars and so many of them they're so close and stuff i'm getting that kind of thing so anybody with the first basic it's, all alive use your words alive is nice for me what's your word animated alive okay somebody and for me all vibing and alive are very similar i don't have any trouble bouncing those two words for me back and forth it's all vibrant it's all alive all alive is vibrant okay somebody your first sense of the activity, within the space we're starting from the beginning as best we could from the beginning, and here's the next within space what's your next you know for me it's got like a creative aspect to it so there's a creation that's occurring through it okay, so something let's say live just to say something it's all alive and roy's that was rory right and roy's getting uh hearing sensing it's going to create yes the creative process is going to start now there might have been something before that but good so far right good some somebody the early stages of the activity within the space how are you picking it up articulation and differentiation you are so great at this you are able to distinguish the subtle details of being more, present, and, and, i feel like that's, what it is articulation and, um sort of like the activation of stuff the, particulars the stuff itself is what the stuff itself is what animated, livened it's a lie stuff okay is alive good enough somebody, somebody, diane you can't just sit there and look at me say something that's nice but your machine is off so, it seems as if it's, coalescing it's gathering itself somehow and we have to let that unfold i guess it seems to be gathering itself to do what what's good what's going to happen right then it's gathering itself but, next you track your own activity you're in your own universe here it's laying out how it laid out you keep track of your own progress we're kind of in a certain way doing a replay of how we got here i would like you to have that sort of mapped out okay get a sense of it then when we get here and get condensed as bobby robert whatever uh we'll have a better sense of things and that might facilitate exiting out of this lobster trap manifest creation vortex that we're in okay so i would uh i would map it is that mapple okay a word okay, somebody in the space activity starts say something yeah i sense it's dusty my for me the first part of the class was just like my back energies just like feeling like i was kind of expanding off of my back oh, stop, i don't want to hear goldfish talk what did my body feel i give right now about your body goldfish i give about how the energies will wall we're talking about the space the space the space not the goldfish saying space i got more space oh my god oh yeah there, that's better i've got more space i'm not talking goldfish talk now are you okay with my on your case yeah i love it um, i guess it feels stretchy but that's still my body that's still me that's still goldfish, i'm not interested right now on the goldfish we'll get to the goldfish as creation continues to create we'll end up back up back if you want back into goldfish country but, not, when we said space you've got the floor original space as best as it can show to me space, space okay, and then slowly i'd like people to see how it how it creates how it first it's alive you can sort of generally agree on that there's some kind of overall aliveness whether you saw pixels or diamonds or stars or always humming is it's alive could we agree sort of temporarily on that word then click what's the next page okay so on this so on this in this space first page is alive second page next, is, what, what, releasing, i get releasing this is nancy, oh okay i get releasing, who why help us here are releasing a sense of releasing of energies, releasing like the big bang releasing okay the energy maybe, the energies of creation are being released and now it's going to start its continuing, creating thing okay yeah that's it okay sure somebody page two then say it's gina hey gina i keep getting the sense that space really loves what goes on here it's kind of gets excited when it starts it's like yeah let's go let's yeah well it's a main piece not the main piece but a big-time main piece, but a big-time main piece so of course of course the whole thing's excited about itself or it really enjoys it yeah, let's say let's say we, got sort of caught up in the trap and we're back to bobby lane and a lobster and a lobster trap whatever uh but we don't realize the more original truer of creation is what you're saying you know there's an all loving there there's an all what are you using what joyful what well i just said it, gets excited because it just loves what happens here yes loves what is all loving there not to be confused with i love i don't love i sort of like you but i used to love you but you ate my twig he screw you we're talking about an original one which your human mind can't quite comprehend but as we get there actually have the experience we'll see we'll see okay again i'm diverging so here's the creation starting to unfold, you're involved all alive all alive somebody had a sense of the word creating or something good yeah okay, now, what's your next sentence page two or page three wherever you're at what's your next sentence no ten cents it's dusty i might still be a fish in a fish tank but i'm wondering like it almost looks like a seed like a seed within a seed if there's like space a seed a seed a seed yeah seed a seed within a c but then space around there that's my take on the second level so to speak yeah i'm not sure here i what to say but we have had a sense historically with a lot of our work was going through the hard shell and that in the hard shell is a seed, okay, right in other words you might say uh i used to be just a body but then i realized there was a core wow and the chorus sort of permeated the body and ran the body and enlivened the body, eventually we say ah that's the self that was there hidden because things are kind of heavy oh, uh so the words uh seed has come up before some, through the years and anyways i'm not sure where you're at with it here but i the word is okay we'll see what you're gonna do with it or what happens with you, okay, a teacher's layout last week was kind of cool, he picked up if i recall uh at this point in the game uh qualities, love and, then and then this uh this uh mixing if you would uh of a character was beginning okay, uh so his layout pattern i don't recall exactly but he's not on tonight but i thought he was heading pretty good here's his face it's all alive next oh they're qualities mixture of qualities he was picking up one of them he's got a few others okay but that's a first main one for him and that mixture of colors mixes up mixes up you the character but character may be too heavy a word we might want to use the word uh art type hair a finer level and as you get heavier and heavier now we have a character okay so i don't know if character is a good word at this level but it's mixing up a prototype, that will eventually tighter and tighter become a character who has those qualities but they maybe have been tainted a bit with the heaviness they're not as pure as they originally were in this big space do i digress too much there for you all right, uh sensei bob here along the along the lines of teisha and what you were just saying you said a couple minutes ago you were interested in our experiencing how we got here and so, this place in creation you're talking about those options those qualities begin to present themselves in a very pure way pure way they're at this level they're very pure and, each of us at that level gravitate towards certain qualities like he's yeah he was beauty and then he had some others oh, sensei used the word uh use the word soaking there he said in this first piece uh you uh you whatever certain qualities are attracted to you or you're attracted to certain qualities whatever and you soak with those qualities or we did soak with those qualities okay so at one level we have very pure qualities there now as it continues that's when we start to spin in and the quality, purity, is uh i don't know can't show us clearly it gets tainted, so, they're still there but they're not in their purest form okay all right the teachers say beauty bob do you remember it was jesus first word, beauty yeah, beauty yeah beauty okay beauty i said love the night beauty, i said love the night beauty actually, okay all right so even the beauty june, june, june, he's a good looking guy there's a kind of attraction he has some type of beauty but we might not use the word in the physical realm but some type of beauty shows through it it's there that kind of thing so anyway it's very pure and it's more original okay, but as we get caught up and get into the vortex into heavier and heavier and heavier, those perfect beautiful colors beautiful qualities aren't quite the same as the more original but even here we can use them we have used them what quality comes easy to you kind of thing, uh, to, extricate ourselves from tighter using that form to backtrack to get out of the tightness back to a more original truer self the true self am i diverging am i laying out too much here sensei i think one thing that's beneficial in the practice you've led us through, if we start from this pure space this most original or close to it original space we can get when we begin that movement back in as you were just describing it may help us to get less convoluted with those qualities than we would otherwise i think that's why again uh saying again what i said was i said was establish his face first because it can really help position you better i know the sense of being more squared away lined up properly with your qualities whatever, that having done this first facilitates where whatever you're going to get into uh you'll get there a little bit better it's, something like that that's very close is what he told me okay so we'll see okay ah anybody anything on their page to their page three page three what's going on in this activity in the space now the activity yeah um this is amy in florida um initially when i first initially it seems like it was quiet but as it kept experience as, it kept getting closer moving through it, seemed like there's sound in this space vibration yeah, yeah sound vibration yeah [Music] and, next page next page did you get there yet i'm just trying to track them the creation happening going page at a time here all i'm trying to do that illusion people later i don't know if activation is the right word but it feels i can't hear who's that that's autumn you're not coming through very loud at all if you can either get close to your mic turn up your volume or switch microphones autumn yellow uh so it's the outs the space feels like it's interacting and moving kind of inward and creating that vibration and it's getting thicker and thicker but also creating a sense of quiet, which then is creating an activation of some kind and creating that beat that then moves outward as well okay so, the possibility here is uh is uh it's moved into two forces whatever you want to call him whatever, and, as those uh two forces dance with each other okay creation continues uh you might be talking about that quiet spot in the middle of, that okay it could be at this level anyway yeah so i think so far so, so good, okay so that great one thing, had to had to in the beginnings of creation i had to move into two things because the one thing the creation wouldn't be quite right i don't know if it could create or uh something wouldn't quite be right but by having two then that set the standards two forces to create okay so all the way down to bobby land i got a mommy and i got a daddy and because i was a bombing a daddy there was a bobby okay so all the way down the line it follows that pattern okay so we take advantage of that pattern for example, at whatever level we're at uh doing whatever it takes to be balanced with two forces whether you're using inhale exhale to represent that or are chanting hey ho, whatever, up, down, whatever if that's two forces then something should be going on here, here if you acknowledge it okay no get caught up in that haha uh you're making the two forces so tight they can't really breed so hey, oh, easy, something's changing here how do i know because there's that force and that force, or hey oh take a moment anything happening here anything happening here hey oh, that sounded a bit better the texture of those sounds was better take a moment what's happening here anything happening here, okay, either a better character eventually a better self will show through so that using main piece of work main piece of work that we've always taught, okay, like you know they do left side and right side like what i always say is any other art i did we did it as a right-handed person i can't say now left now right now left now right so after a while you couldn't tell your left from your right there felt kind of equal okay, so that was a cute insert, into aikido okay to start them off from the get-go with the sense of balance now whether they caught on to what that really meant and if they did left and right and take a moment what's going on here am i a better person does anything change, well let's do another one left right and let's take a moment anything changing here oh i feel a little straighter okay cool ain't much but yes we're stepping the right direction blah, blah so i'm just going over its old time basics here right anyway so, what i would have liked to have done and we'll move on to something else here now uh, with letting the creation unfold a page at a time okay uh so you could uh feel how the forces work how they uh two forces will begin to dance, uh, uh the, uh character again to every word the, uh prototype the art type i like the word archive because it's, finer than a character okay the qualities uh that make up our type our finer qualities the character i'm down to i don't have great love i sort of like you maybe kind of thing uh but at archetype there it's a pure level we'll get into our type discussion another time yeah ah because it does fit into the big picture uh, okay, okay now we've done space, space, okay, now, for like a words let's come back to your, you your you your character your person let's come back to your bobby or your robert okay, i'm back into whatever as if we did space last night but today i'm back in my normal set doing normal things okay so far so good now as a person robert whatever because yesterday you did space or got involved with space whatever the right words are allowed space to show had a sense of it whatever, can now the next day can robert do anything with that or does that help facilitate anything in robert i don't know if i'm asking it quite, properly but you get the sense of what i'm asking i'm asking because you did space on monday does it do anything for you on tuesday and, how what, what might happen you're not going to jump on that one huh for me i, want to come back to my dentist experience i you know i, have a familiarity of being in a certain or working with a sense of, a certain uh space, and, my experience of the world i am in was, freer and more comfortable for the, character that was experiencing his world um there was a translation there a character had just some more room to, be comfortable and express put himself in could we say because we majored in space, uh, that, after, the next day the next week and then the days after uh it's much easier to acknowledge there's more space absolutely yes that and that's for me it was what i did i said hello space and there was a familiarity there so even though we're doing a three by three space or a four by four space it was still space related so doing this more original one may remind us during the week there is space there was a familiarity that, wouldn't have been there if i hadn't touched on it a few times before and i do the same with self hello self hello space okay are people you tracking what we're playing with here this might, beneficially affect you you're back to your human condition but you had a good session last night with space wow it was really fantastic big space does that facilitate anything the next day he said he feels more familiar with it, was easier to go oh yeah space hey, okay seemed like it facilitated something somebody i find it also facilitates a sense of, listening that there's a different uh level of listening that's available to all that is i mean uh in my walk with the raven or whatever that there's uh there's just a different perspective on things okay so with this sense of space being there he i don't know how to word this he automatically ties that into communication and, listening, probably be more aware so for whatever reason maybe that's a main quality communication the whole creation communicates with itself talks to itself whatever, so more space that's just one oh and in more space i get to talk better i get to listen better i see things different because i'm at a whole different level here because of this more space i think that might be an opening for equality to show maybe makes sense if i'm real tight and say i've got a major quality of love i'm hard-pressed but in more space it might be starting to show a bit in more space because that quality has more space to be a better quality there that's cool yeah you've done space very good job is it going to facilitate anything beneficial for you sensei chris from new zealand hey um hey um i found them plain um i just kind of changed jobs and moved into sales so i found that when i came to a customer there wasn't a that immediate sort of sales jump on them or that rush to communicate rush to do something it was more patient um timely and that, that and that space and sort of situation created a um a dialogue between the two myself and the customer as well so i bought a um just calmness i guess a calmness in a um i sense no panic in a tight space we're crowded for time yeah, thanks uh you're always going to be crowded in a tight space if we get more familiar with oh yeah space spaces natural space is there i've touched it that it's not maybe it's most original but we're old friends uh and so that should facilitate uh being calmer being patient having more time, or allocating your time much better okay, yeah, you know people get really tight i don't have time and they start freaking out yeah so space and the time okay space and time well since it got to a level of no space no time very original very original beyond my human ken understanding anyway something you gotta say sensei uh shawn here the sense of word me to death sean go ahead slowly ripeness, and sense of um fruition, i don't know what those words mean talk english to me okay so like when, when, he was talking about uh customers there's a sense of ripeness i mean i'm, in the same situation i'm in sales i've never been in sales my whole life whole life and, suddenly i'm thrust there and i'm, like okay there is a ripeness of the situation in more space don't rush it in more space you tend not to because more space and there's a rightness a uh ripeness yes yeah uh proper timing proper, fulfillment okay somebody take your shot get well john get well yeah thank you sensei very much uh going to finish up in a couple minutes so something for me it feels like after the work was spaced like a relief okay i don't have to it's there's just less pressure yeah okay uh freeze pressure uh what one way of looking at could be me and a two by two i need more space and i try to push into more space which maybe i can lock that off thank god there's more space but that work to move from a two by to a three by uh i'm not doing it right it's too much work, okay so right now we skipped all of that the tricks of the trade of moving from a two to a three to a four or whatever and just said well let's just get the sense of space get that first see if that facilitates us down the line yeah is that where we're going here yes, thank you yeah, it's kind of like even in the human condition space is just there right, uh i know how to say that better but space is just there right here oh there's only this much space, okay, you see you see oh there's the space of the whole house you see amazing oh there's a space of this block of houses it's just there easy oh whoa the space of the whole neighborhood whoa, it's there it's there i don't have to create it it's there the space of the town the space of the state the space of the country i'd have to create it just i don't know acknowledge it and experiential knowledge yeah so having a big sense of an original or more original uh should hopefully facilitate us here in our tight times taking advantage of that oh yeah but space is a buddy of mine hey boom hey space okay it's gonna be such a chore to open up space not after, you made friends with a much more original space uh this oughta be easier and easier okay i'm getting close to the end you got anything you're dying to say that i'm dying to hear any last-minute comments for sensei before we close up here somebody asked what this drink is i drink emergency it's a good drink for me emergency well sensei that may be it i just want to thank you maybe it looks like it i want to thank you again for tonight's class it's been great as usual and i just want to reiterate the opportunity for people to buy sensei a cup of coffee if you haven't done it before it's a grande mocha with uh whip light whip and extra hot so uh buy him a pastry too make a donation hang on a second uh diane you still on weinberg yes yeah yes yeah uh i'm i gotta get to that passing over are you on next week uh probably um let me uh i want you to start with mommy's story okay uh 29th um call me yeah, no i'll be here okay, i'll, so next week we'll try for passing over now i know you young people don't really care about that but you never know there could be an accident but there's a lot of gray hair out there but as best as i can prep you okay uh, there is a book uh, god bob god bob we're talking about if i forget the name of the book already proof of heaven proof of heaven by dr laura that's uh i just skimmed a couple pages only i haven't read the book yet uh but a very smart guy, what was it baba amongst other things a neurosurgeon professor, at harvard medical school i mean that's a smart guy right uh, also again i just had a little sense of him i just read a few pages but uh, he was, what do you call me temporary die near death experience for days okay and he had a brain disease a great thing to get for a brain surgeon type right uh where the whole brain just stops, so he knew his experiences weren't brain activated, because his brain was totally shut down kind of thing and yet he's having these experiences uh so that was cool i uh sense he's well developed because he for what little i know i just read a couple of pages ago uh, he moved along quite well and, in seemingly proper fashion so anyway if that book bob proof of heaven proof of heaven if you want to uh go over that real fast this week uh we could use it as uh there's stands of books out there on passing over temporary whatever, but i thought uh from what i could sense was a few pages he did a damn good job uh bob did you say was the best seller a big time best seller yes big time bestseller i can see why just from the couple pages i read i'll try to read more, uh and borrow off of them a bit enough for tonight thank you thank you sensei thank you everyone for coming we'll see you next week is your friend

um [Music] um hmm and good evening everyone this is lauren somehow underneath these slides and just uh taking a moment to post this slide about voluntary donations uh i know that roy said a few words last week and we've uh really appreciate the contributions that came in afterwards and, would like to uh get everybody up for a little bit towards uh that dos sensei's uh expenses and uh to support his teaching efforts uh in this online virtual dojo so i'll put this information in the text as well but uh anything you can contribute is most appreciated thank you very much and here we are just checking to see if sensei is ready good evening sensei good evening hey, [Music], okay yes uh fred can you adjust yeah i think that's fine okay good evening good evening good evening, ah uh let's go back to last week for a moment uh, anybody playing with space as its own thing space, as its own thing space experiencing itself as space we're talking about the big of uh heading more towards the original space the finer space original more original as opposed to a two by two space a four by four space yes that's space, uh, but i wanted to see if you could move into something more original bigger uh okay any, carry over from space for anybody any exciting things going on for you with that hey sensei it's mark here from new zealand, yeah, yeah, and, yeah i've, been really enjoying the um, the, space it i, think it's been just phenomenal really um i've been kind of by just taking that, time to um experience space it starts to set up it starts to give enough room for everything else to start to happen properly for example um self seems to be able to become more present and, it just seems to be it seems to be like a natural presence and, it just yeah um i was sort of struggling for words a little bit but, the kind of the cleanliness and the, clearness of space in a way i, start to become clean and clear for whatever is going to happen next, is as well so um i'm just yeah i'm just really, en enjoying it and, there seems to be this really nice uh lineup between the kind of the energies that first appear there and um the energies of my i'm not sure if this is the right words but the energies of myself there seems to be some sort of nice, energy match um oh do you want to time it okay uh, the reason i didn't bring up self when we're doing space is just to really give space as its own thing the full stage and to try to move very fast from here to the finer space the more original of space the larger of state of space okay again i like the, sense of more original of space, uh, and just to let it totally have the screen or the stage uh if i brought itself i think myself and stayed and rule and then character and that and it might get a little confusing, we'll come around to that uh to self uh but just to get the space uh, let it be first right here let it show its clearness uh cleanliness could i say uh yeah and then to be very slow on now in that space the activity is going to start the, activity, of the early part of creation is going to start but i wanted to slow that one down too because if people caught that too fast they get caught up in the activity of creation manifest creation the linear creation that we're in and they'd be better off hanging out longer with just the space just the space and yes eventually it's very soon the activity is going to want to start to show that it's there but let's not be in a rush for that uh let's get a fuller, fuller, space so that as that manifest creation starts to uh do its thing you had a better level i don't know it's like having a bigger can i say it this way, try it a bigger frame so that the picture of creation is going to manifest creation that's going to unfold it's, being done on a in, a bigger frame so the picture has a chance to be even clearer is that did i sort of say that oh okay, yeah, yeah, yes, definitely and, it's um i guess for me is, um before that i, i didn't i guess i wasn't um i don't like using the word aware but i, wasn't taking the, time there and, just taking that extra time just, just with the, blankness um as i say it just seems to set everything else up uh more properly back with back with it just it just seems to it's like a blank canvas um all the muck is getting removed um removed um yeah so it's untainted yeah and now you have a better sense of why i use the words like canvas i think i've used that on a friday night or the clean sheet of paper, you're getting a sense of why i might have thrown that out as a as a presentation because it's that kind of, similar to that the space itself yeah, clean sheet of paper or whatever, whatever, whatever so it's not a bad temporary metaphor uh, okay, all right we'll come around to this uh again, and, and, uh hopefully go over the unfolding whatever the right words are the uh manifest creation uh creating and uh t just started that off i thought very well when's that two fridays ago with the quality uh, a major for him quality and then a sense that uh soon there's going to be a character here, uh, yeah it's going to unfold, and what i was trying to do was have you uh so you don't get too cluttered there and i know things in creation can go very fast uh, but to uh but to, to sort of get a better sense of the map of things, by page one is here's your first sense of this unfolding easy hangout you since experience that experience, and then and then page two and then it'll be the next unfolding of it so i'd like to come back around and, hopefully people will be able to do that a bit better clearer is that is that sort of okay yeah okay anything else on uh on space somebody have a good time with it um if not if not i thought we'd ramble around tonight uh in no particular order of anything at the moment uh we've got a few people that have uh experiences comments whatever about uh crossing over passing on and i thought we'd so i think i don't worship where should i start ah, [Applause], okay in the human condition there's a lot of fear of dying right uh because some people don't know anything, if they're dead that's it there ain't nothing it'll be nothing, nothing, nothing some people may be caught up in this uh hell word or oh i'm not going to go to a good place i'm going to go to a bad place and i'll be stuck there forever through eternity uh so a lot of this nonsense misunderstandings could i call them, um, can scare the human the poor human uh, you folks ought to be a bit better with this because hopefully you all have a sense of self to some degree self easy self and you kind of already know that uh there's more to you than just your body awareness consciousness your brains kind of thing and you already should have i hope uh some sense that there's something uh even though the self may not have clarified itself has shown itself and it's, better for the words levels of itself uh still i'm sure most of you have some sense of sense of, something other than this gross body that's going to poop out and die and there you are you still exist okay so i think one thing is to make sure we don't have any people uh who have that great fear of death because that's the end of everything that's the end of bobby but bobby's come and go if you would okay, i still exist okay historically i still insist uh where the hell are we going i'm getting just bouncing around here ah i would like to uh make sure which i don't even know the column tricks of the trade uh tricks of the trade crossing over and uh if we probably won't get to it tonight i'm thinking can you see this i can't see it there we go proof of heaven a neuro surgeon's journey into the afterlife show his name even alexander md very sharp guy in the world, uh, very well educated neurosurgeon plus, he would he was a uh not stanford ever harvard he was a harvard ins a teacher of this stuff uh plus, plus so a very, very, sharp guy uh i think i've only i haven't read the whole book that's what i'm going to do this week uh and see if uh his pattern of his experiences if we can utilize that to map this process this after you pass over process out to you so you get a better sense of it but tonight i thought we'd bounce around a bit where should we go now uh anything quickly off the top any, anybody just blow it off the top i'm crossing over nobody said say it's justin i, would only um i would only wonder how, how precisely our settling down and opening up, process matches the, layout of what we might expect to find experience once we leave the body and, that's uh will where we'll go for example uh in alexander's book his first uh chapter about the crossing over the previous chapters on his life his education his family uh but his first uh, chapter on the actual crossing over i love the title underworld in that great we've done some underworld work so hey, hey yes settling opening easy don't panic easy it looks horrible easy and subtle you move through into finer it's, not as horrible you're moving through finer okay so a heavier approach can be thick potentially ugly okay uh, so i mentioned one of mine when i first the early stages of going down and just sitting and going down was the snakes biting me so what the hell i didn't panic because i was sitting to meditate so got to live with it i continued boom more snakes it was a snake pit if i could hook good grief and i could, hook good grief and i could actually, feel them hit me you know wow again still in the meditation space let me hang out here continued hanging out settling opening and then they begin to smile at me hey i thought aha the game is a foot here and i continued and it turned out not to be snakes with spiraling energies i continued and eventually it was a real deep uh source a beautiful lady moving her arms and the energy spirals were like, i don't know her pets or something she'd move and the energies would spiral up so those snakes that were biting me and i don't care for snakes horrible situation easy, easy, easy and you start to get closer to the truth of things and the truer experience of things, yeah and he goes through that here so again i'd like to hold this for next week but he goes through his with his underworld a little thick heavy i remember uh i'll bring it up this guy had no practice experience he thought the brain was everything he had no, spiritual interest no religious interest okay it was his intelligence and how he coped in the world and whatever, whatever, so in a certain way coming from his human to this experience uh, he didn't have anything from his human life to help facilitate but it's interesting uh how he developed again we'll dialogue him later uh but yeah a lot of our stuff is uh contains any tricks of the trade to properly move on okay, so um see let's start with diane, florida, yeah i'm here okay uh [Music] you want to jump in and start it your grandmother's story i was um i was training i was on the mountain in the aikido mat in mountain view and i got a phone call that my, grandmother had, passed and prior to that though when i knew she was i knew she was dying i asked you bob to do a pass on what was going on i was trying to figure out when i was in mountain view and she was in albany new york i was trying to understand when i should go back and see her you know how much time i had and the first thing you said was you started to kind of do a pass you know to tune into her and the first thing he said was i'm picking up two, souls or two beings or two people and i said oh yeah that's my grandfather he had passed about 15 years earlier and um he was hanging out there with her and, at this time she's crossing her head not yet no not even before and i okay and actually i actually went to see her um before she died and she, in her odd way she kept kind of fading out and um my mom and my aunt would kind of bring her back but i would stay with her when she kind of went out and then she started talking to me telling me she was she was talking to her dead husband you know she was doing that before she before she left let me jump and then she did pass people up to date here uh so the, husband, knowing she's gonna die starts to hover in because of this caring interest uh it looks like he's going to take on the job of her guide so he comes in early and starts to be there, so that's the stage where she's still in the hospital bed talking to her husband i'm talking to my husband here she thought she was going a little crazy right okay you had picked that up right away and um uh so then when i got the i was back in california and i got the phone call from my mom who was all tearful and everything, let you pass and i hung up and i went back on the mat and i was moved to just sit down on the side of the mat and i went into a meditative space and uh opened up to her journey and i the experience was as if my grandfather was, was with her and they would they would i would sense them at a certain level at a certain uh place and she was like and she like this doctor guy i mean she had no, training you know no, experience of anything but she was a really good person anyway and so she would be at this place and her i would sense her it was as if her face would light up and she was like oh this is really cool and then they would kind of disappear again it's like he would not let her stay there and they would they would go to they would go to a finer level again yeah and eat each other right there that's good that these are levels or dimensional levels or astral playing levels but different levels go yeah and so um i just kept going along with it and it kept repeating itself you know she would they would get to another level she would like be really wowed by it and he would kind of bring her further i'm not sure how far they actually went um but it was uh it was really extraordinary and i was so interesting to me is i'm kind of the doubting thomas here all the time and um i might have thought i was just making this up but there was another woman in our meditation group who had pretty developed psychic abilities and she saw me sitting on the mat she sat down behind me and after when i finally came out of it um she said she had tracked me and had tracking her right and she validated you know she experienced everything that i experienced and um you know she was experiencing seeing the same thing and so it, made me feel really um really um more secure that in the reality of it yeah, and i hope you've learned your lesson since stop doubting well the little guy oh no diana diane little diane still definitely um says really remember people when you get into finer dimensions and stuff and if you still have the bobby mine or the robert mine he can't cope with that he's going to doubt it he's going to doubt it he's going to question it he's going to make up stories about it you gotta learn how to do this okay and if you hang out and sense, experience now you get the experience of it that's that starts to help just the awareness part you might doubt that it's, too mentally trippy or something uh but to experience these dimensions just be aware of them and the experience of them that really helps that really helps because it's uh he might even use that word in his book tactile or something tactile is that a proper word yes tangible yeah and certainly very tangible yeah, anyway, so, oh uh so oh uh so uh, so when you cross over following diana's story here um you'll hit a certain level but, you know when we do levels when you do a two by two and you exist as a two by twoer that you can trade that in and move into a three by three and that mixes up a three by three uh that's basically uh, uh what was happening to her grandmother uh that the husband was saying no i know that's nice for you honey but you can do better than that come on and then they disappear for a moment boom be in a better place uh so the two by the three by the four by sort of a rough example of uh moving through dimensions to finer, levels, i think we touch that fairly good i think, you happy with that diana yeah you caught me eating anybody anything on that piece because that was a, nice piece so part of the tricks we'll try to get across this week next weekend uh will, be so you can move on uh move on a little bit better faster fuller uh again here my friday night group you got to be have a little better sense of this and that should be kind of natural but just to kind of know the tricks i can't, hurt so we'll try to clarify them when we can anybody anything on our conversation here diane's layout nobody confused or lost or what well since this is lauren and i uh it's not something that i uh personally experienced but uh my wife experienced it she's not here right now to tell her story but i'd like to share it paraphrase okay her father passed away in his mid-80s and two and a half years later his wife of wife of almost 60 years trisha's mother passed away in her late 80s and, especially on the death of her mom trish was, you know really felt alone and the one night in a dream uh, her character in a dream she was in her own dream and she got a phone call in the dream and she picked up the phone and it was her mom and she said mom where are you i said oh i don't know let me ask your dad, she can hear her, mom ask her dad joe where are we and she doesn't hear the location but her mom comes back on and it's like i don't know joe doesn't know exactly but we're in a nice place uh oh gotta go bye have a good time bye trish, and, trisha, uh woke from that feeling so overjoyed and relieved of her grief uh the sense that her mom and dad were okay, and uh and uh and i and uh you know it, spoke to both of us that uh, you know they were had passed on but they were not gone yeah, yeah so i just wanted to share that thank you uh yeah i um let's go over the dream part because some people don't know what you think about dreams but there's a level of dreams what do they call it in present-day psychology conscious mind is subconscious vivid dreaming it's like you're in the realm of subconscious is that what they say oh maybe what i'm saying is that the dream, felt so real yeah that it, was as if manifest tactile, yeah, that's a good word okay uh so that anyway there's people watching understand uh there are levels of dreaming, where, they're a very fine dimension and can be tactile or very clear and distinct and all of that okay so i'm not sure your ideas about dreams being some kind of mental or whatever but there's a certain level of dreams which are very acceptable okay uh, then brings us to our next person again from florida and you're muted please unmute amy your microphone is muted on your side that's the amy i know really i got it got it okay i'm here i, uh i've had a number of experiences so, the first one i want to share is regarding my dad when my dad was dying my father and i were very close he was not a spiritual man or a religious man but as he was dying i said to him dad if it's possible um could you come back and let me know um what it's like on the other side you know and he said yes and um i had the first three i had a series of dreams the first dream is he comes in a row boat and he can't come up on the land that i'm on so i get into the rowboat and we get into this middle place and we're walking around and i said dad what's it like to be dead and what he shows me with his whole presence and the message he gives me is there's no fear yeah that's the first that was the first dream i had then i have this by the way that'll crop up in his book that phrase no fear go ahead sorry yeah then i had a series of dreams i had it two or three times where um i see my father like he's uh he's he looks like he's in his thirties like he's walking around in the cabana sets that they used to have and sandals and he's down in la and um and i run over to him i said dad i'm so happy to see you, know and hug him and, then i get really mad i said i thought you were dead mom and i were so upset we thought you were dead and he doesn't say anything to me, i had that dream two or three times um until i really got that the message was well there's life after death so um then the next dream i had of him was um was um he comes to me and he's with this woman and um you know i'm kind of like what's he doing with this woman you know and um he says to me i have to go away for a while but if you need me you can call me you know and um i called him not immediately but after a while i call him and in my dream he comes swimming towards me and he's exhausted and i realized no, don't call him you know he's somewhere else and i realized the woman he's with was kind of his guide, you know uh helping him um so those were the dreams around my dad that were very okay can you hold it there my name is we jump in uh so in the two dreams the one with the rowboat, uh, and the difficulty in coming to the heavy shore that she was standing on okay, something there now here she catches that uh, how to say it um oh to ask him to come here into the heavy, heavy, heavy, it's a little bit hard but for you as a heavy-duty easy, easy and you can move closer or after a while practice to their actual location that's also here, available uh so okay yeah, anyway, yeah go ahead um then i had dreams about my mother and um, my mom um my mom um my mother had dementia the last few years of her life and she became this woman that was just filled with goodness you know um and love and um and um she would have a dream where she and when she'd wake up she'd say to me amy would you go upstairs and get me the white coat i said mom we have no upstairs she says oh yes your father built it for me it's all white and it's beautiful, and she had that dream a number of times when she passed i couldn't grieve for her i and i was so close to her but i couldn't grieve with her instead i just felt this state of love that i have never felt in my whole life and it was with me for months and then finally it began to like dissipate um and then i was able to grieve um, the, other piece that i had i've had a couple but one of the other ones that i had was that um i'm in a rowboat we're in this cave and i'm with a few other people and you know, we're, going around in this boat and nothing seems to be happening and all of a sudden this portal opens up and um we're in this place that are is the most beautiful colors i've ever seen i've never seen anything like this you know this level of beauty and um i and um i the message i got was this is what your mother saw when she left yeah by the way people i like the word portal as a we somebody called that doorway portal is a nice word i like the word portal also yeah and interestingly for me was since i had that experience i've been um, the quality of beauty has become is beginning to come through me where that was never one of those that i majored in you know so that was kind of interesting and, the last dream that i'll share is i dreamt that i died that i got shot and i died and um i was a was a zoom i, wasn't in an astral body anymore all of a sudden all i was, consciousness i had no body no i was just consciousness and i was just there in this huge space and um i got scared you know and i didn't know how do you move in this what do you do and, the message that i got was just put out your intent and as i put out my intent i was able to move so those are my those are the ones i wanted to share intent is an interesting word we should file that away it may come back one day with more advanced work let's see uh another thing we could say about the uh, self, the consciousness uh that didn't know it could move or something so some type of flack of words activation there oh, a simple one would be i'm aware then the beginning of experience of you aware experiencing and that should start to activate it where it gets better it catches better how things work uh so that feeling of uh whatever amy however you said it just hanging there where did you it wasn't it was it was a huge empty space yeah but there you are consciousness and i'm, scared i, feel terror yeah, something about moving not being able to move what no i, couldn't i didn't i, felt stuck there like i couldn't move okay that part that part right there i felt stuck there, uh aware uh aware experience, experiencing i am aware that'll start things going we'll just move along better uh know what it's involved with better so, to get things moving you can't hardly be aware experience experiencing i'm aware that should started going or any kind of two-beat thing to get it going, okay, susan and i are dealing with cells in, her healing format thing and uh sometimes we ask them to be more a little more alive present with their person to get some healing stuff going on here uh and so we've been playing with them and having them activate okay as susan would you remind me uh what form we're using to get them to activate i sort of went blank there for a moment susan young or she behind the mountain he's here soon say just a moment yeah what's the pattern we've been using to get, the uh the uh, selves present to come more alive i know we use a 2b but i'm playing for some reason at the moment you follow this because uh most often just a two beat yeah it's most often a two beat up down or in out two beat let's just get a two beat going yeah so basic simple yeah and that starts to activate uh, that the, uh self in that case yeah simple trick simple trick yeah so whether to beating or aware experience experiencing aware then it starts to get things going okay, ah, so far anybody anything else or what's been thrown out anybody getting too confused too lost something similar you want to throw out i sense it's justin again i was with my father when he was passing away, and, um and, um and he and he like many people didn't have a lot of religious or spiritual understandings of meditative practices etc but there was a sense of, being of being ill and really uncomfortable and how um, he was looking forward to being free of all that heavy discomfort sensation outside so, he had a sense how did i get into this predicament and yet and yet on the other side of this there's just comfort yeah and he was really looking forward to that it's uh i think maybe mentioned through the years uh years uh dead people like to visit pass through so it's uh anyway it's not unusual for me uh to have that happen but many times i've heard them say uh, god it's so nice on this side i don't hurt anymore yeah justin yeah so nice on this side i don't hurt anymore i've heard that more than once so, uh, so if you're going out hurting hang in there hanging in there it'll be gone soon yeah okay uh let's see uh tj, had some time in a medical career you want to go over, sure, at the bedside of dying people or whatever wherever you are at there in my uh in my earlier life i was a pulmonary technician so i found myself in emergency rooms and icu's and ccus and i have to say you know had the um the privilege of being with people as they as they act in the moment of their death, it's, really quite a unique experience, and i um i guess you know it's a natural thing so i had many experiences uh being at the bedside at the moment of transition, what was your sense yeah, so you're always quite sensitive what was your sense right there what was your sense my perception of that in, a in a very deep and empathetic way was there was a release uh, that was i could i could see you can see the moment of release and you can definitely feel it i certainly felt it for uh everyone that i that i had the, opportunity to be with at that moment and there was uh the sense was and unusually was very peaceful almost without exception except in extreme trauma conditions and extreme trauma uh conditions people were likely already out of body so i'll talk about that in just a moment but in the cases of the of individuals being um being um at that moment where they're that exhale breath is always connected with spirit and you can you can feel that essence i won't say i was seeing something in the auric way uh that, maybe some kinds of psychics can, see but there is a feeling there is a sense of release and um you know as justin was talking about and amy too um, diana, the, though those moments of release are, it's a for one thing it's very natural it seems like a very natural event to have that release and then to see the to see the body um i'm used to you know doing vitals and really connecting with people and making sure you know they're, pumping and they're breathing and they're you know and all of that but the moment after that after that release it's almost as if you could feel that out generally out of the heart feeling out of the chest that last breath releases and the and the consciousness leaves the form and you can definitely feel touching a body that has just uh just died just exhaled the last breath the fact that they're not there anymore and, the, body is that is a shell yeah let me jump in a second please uh a line here in the book uh that precedes the underworld chapter uh his son has come to visit him at the hospital uh, my physical body was there in front of him but the dad he knew was gone now he has this or perhaps a better word to use is yeah else elsewhere i thought that was cute anyway so uh one other thing in relationship to, this transition is that many of you many of us have had what we know is outer body experiences and sometimes that can happen with an accident sometimes it can happen with, good drugs or bad drugs or it can happen any of a number of ways i, know sensei you've had it out in, meditative practices and people can people can have that kind of outer body experience we've also talked a bit about dreams, and sometimes there'll be a lucid dreaming or what was referred to earlier i think by lauren as vivid dreaming there is consciousness is awake but you can actually kind of look down and see your physical form and realize that who you are is his consciousness and it has a certain kind of container but it's not just the physical body so these important experiences that we have, um, can, can lead to a greater ease around that time of transition and even if people are um unsure as people have talked about uh you know uh not being spiritual well, i always think of uh tlr des chardin in this wonderful saying um we are not human beings having a spiritual experience we are spiritual beings having a human experience human experience, human experience yeah well i've appreciated that and, that kind of gives some way to understanding the nature of who we are as a being yes it's all connected with this stuff but it's more than and it goes on afterwards by the way that uh comment by dejardin is very profound uh because uh, one of the one of the purposes of an original self is to experience the creation to know better who he is yeah so he's so he's totally there starts his creation, uh now we screwed up because we spun in a little too tight but that's another story but anyway to experience so that bobby experiences something robert experiences or another life experiences or another life experiences to experience to experience yeah but uh but uh but like he said it the other way around yeah the other way itself here yeah that's right and this one is experiencing this life and the next life that one is experiencing the life from that it exists in whatever, anyway nice, comment by, him yeah for sure uh i'll offer one last point because those are uh you know both the moment of death outer body experiences that, we all or most of us have had in one form or another but it's also been referenced as there is kind of this uh, energetic telepathic lattice work of communication uh i think amy spoke very beautifully of that and uh as uh as did diana um and uh lauren's uh wife also referenced that, sense of where is this communication coming from and how can i how am i having this the fact that, were connected through an energetic um kind of network levels yeah many levels the lattice that's i often refer to it as the energetic lattice work like the matrix but better but better i couldn't keep up with the matrix anyway uh yeah thank you yeah thank you yeah so teacher reminded me one of my early experiences of sitting meditating uh, what would you call it this hovering over what we call that again i'm dumb tonight outer body experience uh okay so i'm, hovering over my physical body sitting here uh and uh oh wow because i'm aware that as it's over i'm aware of myself as this over but my body is there below me so to speak yeah below me i was hovering over it i said oh and i'm not the body i still exist i'm still me or conscious of myself uh so that was one of my early ones that's cute uh a brad has one a recent one reset sure so um sorry so recently a very close friend of mine died under really tragic circumstances um, and you know on, i'm curious on two senses one from a human perspective very close so why did this happen the normal reaction because it was very tragic um and then um you know i'm trying to research from just a big universal bigger sense so that's the context and so um so i, sat the, day after the event occurred um you know i you know i just felt a really strong presence um you know again i'm trying to dialogue and trying to feel senses self um you know the first thing that happened was i mean it the sense was it, was he wasn't with me physically but it's kind of a vibration that i s it's like if i would have saw him in any other normal situation oh that's my friend there it is it's just he recognized him yes thank you so that was um that was the experience and again it very happened pretty quickly the day after um and so that presence was very strong um so yeah i'm going to keep working settling opening just trying to set more of a dialogue and see what communicate better yeah just communicate better yeah just communicate i mean it's you know and maybe that was trying to make sense of the tragedy um, so yeah i mean this isn't i'm kind of getting to the age now where these things are starting to happen more frequently and so uh yeah i've never felt any problem in recognizing uh somebody passing through wanting to check in or say hi or whatever you instantly kind of recognize it's not like a person is standing there in front of you although, some people have seen you know image but mine is more of an inner seeing but there's no questioning who they are you can feel who they are in fact you kind of know who they are before you really go oh and then really acknowledge them you can feel, them their presence however to say that well, uh so another level of communicating uh what was that movie the, seven samurai seven, samurai seventh samurai remember the scene behind the door where they're testing the guys see who they're gonna hire right, and some of the guys would go i'm not gonna enter that building what are you up to uh okay uh but if it were uh somebody pleasant or a beautiful girl i'm sure they trump through that door no worries but that sense of sensing again, to depict that in the movie shows oh yeah people can sense if they're trained a little bit if you train yourself easy subtle, sense, let me think about that no, not there settle, easy, open sense since okay, now this first guy doesn't know what that means yet i don't need to train him i just got to get him to shut up to settle and move into a different zone we laid that out on one of the paper maps, uh i forgot how we did a thinking brain thinking brain a feeling brain a sensing brain finer and a finer feeling brain and then a sensing level the same thing level someplace that we have to let go of the word brain because that'll interfere with the continuing development which is where this book by the way does very well because uh his whole life was brain, brain he thought everything was off of that suddenly, he's when he passes over temporarily seven days he's over but he had a brain disease uh his whole brain had shut down there was nothing so in retrospect he said whoa i had all these experiences but it couldn't have been to do with my brain because my brain was totally shut down medically scientifically where but he was still having experiences so anyway blah, okay did we lose anybody along the way since i have a question yeah it's diana diane yeah so um it seems it's i've done a number of passes and i seem to have an ability to communicate with people on the other side at times but it seems that in this crossing over that one's expectations if there's not a guide if there's not a guide it seems it seems once expectations seem to influence where they end up because when my other grandmother passed i kind of tuned in and was sort of almost expecting something to happen i don't know exactly what but i, couldn't pick them up at my her or my grandfather who also had passed earlier until after a long time i realized that they were both asleep they were literally just felt like they were asleep yes decades later decades later in my time frame, i have been able to make contact with that grandmother as well but for decades in our time frame it was just like they were totally asleep yeah what don't, we yell it folks come on wake up here duh what are you talking about sensei duh, jesus stop being so thick settle open come on play the game let's go uh so yeah asleep uh thick, yeah, yeah unfortunately um oh one about to brag for a moment uh that he was picking up his buddy the next day that sort of note that uh because there's probably a time variation uh, maybe some people will go through their process their crossing over process, their crossing over process and they won't uh come visit you until they finish that process and then they may come visit so i'm not sure the different timing capabilities the different timing uh that, i, don't exactly know not, that, matters if they visit they visit hey how you doing you know i didn't say that well there usually for me if somebody says uh oh god i shouldn't say this because you'll call me and ask you to check in with your dying relative don't do that i'm busy uh but anyway uh and if i found out they just died uh i may not bother checking on them because they i think in many cases they're still uh, traumatizing they're still hanging on to their to their uh even though they're dead they're still hanging on to that life a little too heavily takes them a while to disengage, disengage and then they can start to really go through a process if they're capable of moving along if they're not asleep is what i'm trying to say if they're not asleep not too dense okay and again i'm not did i say that sir okay doesn't matter uh i'm not sure how strong beliefs can be held, uh, so for example i would uh i'll mention it now this idea of a dark tunnel and then light and you're there, okay now is it possible that some people are well versed in that sense of things they've heard about it before a lot of people say no a dark tunnel and then light and you're there that they might be too fast to go for that, where i would suggest easy in the darkness be present except the dark that's there descend nicely fully, you'll eventually get to a light but the better you do this downtime dark the better level you'll get to you'll get to a better dimension the better you down time get to a better dimension so again back to uh diana's story where grandmother is ready to stop and somebody said no come on come on she moved on she wrote oh this is even better i'd like to stop here we could surmise somebody said no i'm not calling you better than that come along with me that to me is a dimensional thing so when you cross over uh and you run into dark don't panic if you're not too that's another story don't panic [Music], uh, susan and i were checking on somebody for some reason uh a guy uh she really liked she wanted to check him out so i traveled with her check them out and uh he hit the dark and he just ah accepted it real fast and the oh flavor it was like he was in a in a parachute in the dark just that feeling ah, and he did quite well with the fullness of dark got to a very nice level okay, so it's a bigger example of the light at the end of the tunnel there's a little bit of dark now there's light but really, fuller of the fuller of downtime further and fuller okay my second camera's out so it's not comfortable to stand and show anything but i was going to remind you by doing a simple uh three by three and then the three by three because the center circle and it makes you're a three by three character your you at that level then you trade it in or down time easy with the down quiet seeming nothing down time dark time easy then after a little bit you begin to send since something is activating and you open to it and you're in a what i say three you're in a four by four so that pattern we only do it for a few minutes but that pattern is an ongoing pattern, so if you want to play if you want to prepare to cross over i would suggest, you hang out with just the sense of dark longer deeper fuller just get used to it and know how, nice it is finer dimensions of dark finer so you're going into the subsoil nutrient factor there if you're too thick it could look heavy and you're bumping into worms and rocks and, but easy it's dimensional as you settle easy open easy open you start to pick up its truer flavor okay so maybe a fast way of saying that is there seems to be a, down dark shade from a light world a dark down dark shade a certain amount of down time dark time and then that shade opens at the another level of light and then you enjoy that level of light for whatever and then that one will downtime close the shade brings it to a finer level is a process that i in many different ways try to lay out is that sort of okay almost clear don't be afraid of down time don't be don't be afraid of down time don't be afraid of doubt the better you're easy with it like her grandmother the better dimension you can move to okay, uh, i was attracting one guy uh, and he didn't take advantage i, didn't catch his the early part but he didn't take advantage so he did what we call going back to the line at the airport to stand in line to come back again as soon as possible he didn't take advantage of that, passing over time and the finer dimension you call them astral planes the finer levels you can get into to continue your development so eventually if you want to come back you're more developed so you come back at a better level, you line up better you're carrying more of the, self a little closer here whatever, you come back as a improved person you come back as a little more advanced person let's say the potential is there so you don't want to short circuit or race through the crossover time uh it's a uh you know i think he's i hope he says it well i haven't written except for that chapter so i haven't gone into the book yet uh but i'm hoping he lays out these, moves we'll see his languaging of them, did you follow any of that i got lost yeah sensei we had a conversation a couple months ago about, this topic in brief and you, said at that moment um you're going if you easy uh go easier take your time with this process you can position yourself better when coming back you can sort of line up the situations of your rebirth so they're more advantageous to you for example if you have an aptitude for music, you might take a, new form in the family of the director of juilliard and not be born on a farm somewhere and you know you, can sort of position yourself better that's what you can do in the astral planes you, it's you continue learning you continue practicing continue developing and you can uh stay at the astral plane uh for, ages if you want okay i got one guy i check in with he's and i don't know how long he's been in an astral play i think since atlantis or something he's been there a long time i don't know what his aversion is to becoming a, a person but that's his call what whatever, so where am i going with that uh but if you, if you do well in the astral planes the finer dimensions then you potentially come back finer i mentioned to you i, tracked nikki because he was a friend of mine and he loved acting but didn't get to be the big name this time uh but i was happy to see him in quote the astral planes, developing and then moving along developing and moving along developing, and moving along developing so he wasn't one of those big bang guys he took time and he was working on something it's him working on something, it's him working on something developing, because he wants to be big time actor, so anyway i thought his prep there was very good i was impressed anyway i don't know say something we got a few minutes, i think i think say something questions insights problems stories of yours yeah this is linda morris linda yes, um i, i haven't had a lot of experience being at the side of people who have passed but i was with my mother she was 87 she was preparing to die for several weeks, and then when she passed i just want to say a couple of things that are things that you've touched on the ease the easing i could see that i could just see that and her exhale was a surrender she surrendered that breath and when she passed, all of the stress of her earthly existence, left her face and she was glowingly beautiful i just wanted to add those little bits to what has already been said yeah thank you yeah, and yeah and something like that some people are going to be faster at that you know they take their last breath and within a moment they're looking beautiful they're dead but they're looking beautiful something is radiating there uh that wouldn't be a common occurrence a heavy wouldn't have that happen the heavy guy would die and he'd probably still be hanging on to his heaviness kind of thing he might not look handsome so uh it was fun when i was doing the estate business that was fun business for me i enjoyed that anyway uh and but walking into a decedent somebody who's died decedent's apartment or house and uh some of the cases it felt like a vacuum so you knew the, person uh went someplace else really fast because there's like a vacuum you could feel it okay, others, uh you touch their stuff and they suddenly be there and one hey what's, going on what are you doing and stuff like that uh, so doesn't mean they were less developed it's just they were hovering in close closer for whatever reason but some of them my brother always wanted to go to heaven he was the catholic saint in the family uh, so when he passed on he's not going to take time to say hi bobby i'm, okay gone man he's gone to heaven whatever that means to him anyway uh, one hard job one of my first jobs clearing his state was this old man when old man had died as a old man and was hanging around heavy bitching, uh he was kind of tiring to hang around oh i could have done my fancy nado magic but uh after four hours or so that was it i'll come back the next day but it's like working there six hours or eight hours it was tiring to have this guy around he was still bitching so heavy, uh, it'll take him a while because he's so heavy but eventually we're gonna say the forces of the universe of creation will touch him and he'll have to hopefully move along to a better level hopefully or he's so heavy he might be one of those guys is standing in line waiting to jump back in again, and he'll probably come back not much improved or whatever slowly improved but not much um anyway yeah it was fun working a job katja was very good at this uh she was a little bit better than me and picking up oh someone saw his hair we did the name them or knew their names oh yeah, she often picked them up before i, did she was kind of sensitive and sometimes in the dialogue i use a nickname for one lady who had passed over and consciousness she doesn't like that nickname anyway i guess if you're heavy hard, for somebody who's crossed over to kind of show themselves because you're kind of heavy as you settle and open and easy and i think that was part of that, used to happen to me quite naturally out of nowhere i wasn't looking to talk to dead people or anything like that it was begin to happen and it would happen again uh, i think as you settle and you're vibing at a better level then that possibility is there and if you want to uh communicate or spend some time with a friend of yours uh yeah settle and just find the frequency, ah settle and, there should be a, frequency i don't know better words than that um a sense that you're in the communication lines with it with them must be a better way of saying this diane uh you sort of mentioned you've had of if you wanted to check in with somebody you'd settle you'd open finer sense and just this sense of when you know you're at the right level or in the right frequency uh that you begin to expect them to clearly be there showing or communicating with [Music], you i, don't i, haven't been doing it as much recently but yeah it's just a sense of um i don't know knowing sensing experiencing okay probably intention has a lot to do with it too right there right not if you're what depends you've got to be careful i have an intention i want to talk to joe, it's so heavy your intentions for okay, yeah an intention yes i'd like to talk to my beloved cousin charlie who i cared for so much charlie are you around easy, settle finer within the finer going out so yes there's an intention but i, don't know how people use certain words you see so i have to be careful on certain words i intend to get them i'm going to get them, scratching like that with the word attention so anyway people will figure out if you're interested you'll sit you'll figure it out i think uh oh uh just through i think i might have mentioned once i used to play this game for a while it's kind of fun for me uh i don't know why it came up anyway i would sit on my couch and i would mentally cut my wrist bleed to death and practice dying okay i might say oh what about the laundry i said no more laundry for you anymore you're dying you're gonna be dead soon forget about the laundry okay and once i get rid of all these bobby thoughts robert thoughts whatever and we just i would just practice bleeding to death and dying and see if i could uh experience anything that way and i don't remember what i got out of it but i did enjoy doing it for a bit it was kind of fun so you want to practice what it's going to be like you can practice and by the way if you do a faster form i used to do a slow form just to go through the each stage you know uh but you can do things faster but fully when i say fast i don't mean fast idea faster easier faster, easier faster it's a dimensional speed okay not an idea speed you lose that other aspects that are so important or the actual experience actually i'm finishing up here thank you so much sensei thank you thank you so much sensei thank you again next week next week i'll try to go through this book this week and see if he if he uh follows a good pattern that we can go over uh because he uh he had a great experience uh on the other side so uh for those of you who have read the book umpteen years ago uh skim it again, uh those of you uh i got this from um amazon, and only took a day and it's a second hand copy so i'm not too expensive uh only took a day and came on my front porch so uh if you're interested it might be a good book so far i'm, very interested in finishing it uh catch his experiences i think he did a good job thank you sensei and everyone it's available as a kindle and an audible as well, thank you yeah, i just like it soak with the words myself, okay but whatever, whatever thank you so much sensei thank you guys thank you everyone good night good night thank you thank you sensei thank you everyone good night good night good night all

give me a call sunday if he's free i haven't talked to him for a while okay, he's on the call but he's uh driving so he can't interact so much and so watch if he's free we're ready to have you un open your camera if you're ready to begin very good, evening cincinnati all right you're saying go okay it'll have to do okay nde, wow, near death experience okay the, proof of heaven book okay, uh that i'll refer to i think tonight even eben alexander.com apparently he's got a lot of material available, i, watched don't bark at me uh anyway if you're interested in following up on this he mentions a lot of other books he's really into it now after his experience uh and he'll mention probably some sites where he's given uh lectures, to different groups and i watch one of them it was pretty good pretty good he's an intelligent fellow of course so he lays pretty well so if you're interested in the subject you want to go into more detail it'd be a guy to check through ah, okay we had some good stories last week from the different people any anybody else with an actual experience, uh of a loved one crossing over sensei this is gina vina a few years ago i had sepsis which is pretty serious and i was got to the point where they told my family i was dying and that was it and, i was intubated and a mutual friend of ours called you and i guess asked you can we do anything or you know is she really going to die and you said you told her she's deciding right now and what was going on with of course i didn't know any of that because i was in a coma but what i saw was i was hating this tube i mean it's not like the movies it's horrendous to have that thing down your throat and i just couldn't take it anymore or the and i was fighting the sickness and i just gave up i just said hi this is you know goodbye i cannot handle this and on the right side this whole kind of membrane wall appeared and there was a rough cut opening in it about four feet wide and i looked through and it was just clouds dark clouds and i could see for miles, and i was told you can get rid of the tube and you can go in here and you'll just float you'll be totally comfortable you'll, feel wonderful and you'll, you'll feel wonderful and you'll just sail through these cla and they were, they weren't raining but they were they weren't raining but they were stormy looking it wasn't beautiful in white light and you know no angels nothing just it was the doorway yeah into these dark clouds and but they said you'll be fine and you'll then you'll just sail forever but you'll be alone and when they said that i just went uh, i choose the tube and that was that's my story and, then when i of course when i came back my friend told me what you had said which made me believe that i mean that's as real to me as if it happened an hour ago i can still see the whole thing, so, i wasn't dead i mean i wasn't like that doctor in the book but i was this was a bit unusual uh so what about the deciding part that's what i want to ask you because you said she's deciding and i definitely decided so i didn't know you could decide anything you were hanging in the middle i guess is why i said i don't remember the details now but that was my sense of checking you out there uh that you're kind of you haven't decided yet it was your call and you called to go i'm going back i'll take the tube okay it's terrible as it is i'll take that and i think it wasn't presented to me beautifully i think it probably wasn't my time you know they weren't like people calling me in golden lights or anything it was pretty difficult, but if you had gone through you'd eventually move along in that realm and things would start to open up it's not that you saw dark clouds and it's going to be dark clouds for a million years oh that's what i thought that's why come on lady have you heard of this thing called dimensionality well that was a long time ago okay it was a few years ago i was oh okay thank you but yeah uh he mentioned that in his book billowy clouds uh some darkness i think at first yeah then you'll learn how to utilize the dark but let's not get ahead of ourselves here uh so anyway you chose to, stay on the earth plane okay ah hey anybody else experience your experience or a loved one you're tracking or anything like that this is amy from florida i had one other experience which was i thought pretty interesting i, was doing aikido during those years and living in fairfax and i woke up one night and um all of a sudden in i didn't know it was night i thought it was day because there was light coming oops i didn't want to be on camera sorry about that um i um i um i thought it was i thought it was the day, and i walked into my living room in fairfax which had windows on one whole side that looked over the mountain and as i walked there, was this white light that was the brightest white light, that was the brightest white light i have ever seen and i started walking towards it and what i sensed or heard or whatever was you're not ready yet so i went back into my bedroom and i went back into bed i woke up sometime later and it was dark so i thought that was interesting i know if the uh self, uh so let's say amy has uh what to say a fair degree a good degree of a sense of self and self was getting freer and, saw that oh there's a brighter potential here and uh for what reason uh not time for you to go through you're not gonna die and pass on, through that to and through that light but just a certain level of awareness where you can get the lay of the land get some degree of an experience so cool yeah that's what i thought too that that's what it was about it was it was beginning to and that period of my life i was beginning to have different experiences of astral planes and different kinds of stuff so this was just one more to show me that there was more than i consciously knew um the uh dr alexander goes through uh, totally opposite from his belief as a doctor before his experience uh of all the experiences he was having when his brain was basically totally shut off so he said he had kind of like an amnesia which aided him in moving along and being he was shown a lot they took him on a tour kind of thing uh, but he thought uh because he was so total on that brain dead thing uh, that, gave him a type of amnesia, where, the, human system and any residue of the human system was obliterated didn't exist so he was able to move deep and be shown a lot have a lot of interesting experiences um where am i going with that anyway his story is a bit different because most people when they pass over will be aware that oh not i'm not though and i'm dead you know let me check my house caught you doing and whatever, whatever oh there's uncle whoever hey how are you nice to see you here uh, that there's a lot of that kind of stuff that he didn't experience so he, called it a type of amnesia from all of that uh dr alexander life was totally not there for him so his case a little bit unusual but as he reads all the other stories of people that had an hour or whatever 20 minutes on the other side or now or on the other side before they were revived, in their nde experience uh he can re relate it's nothing they say about those earlier stages that throws him off any so although he didn't experience, the, more the normal type because of this totalness of amnesia if you would uh i don't know if anything like that makes sense but just uh he mentions it in his book so if you're interested you read the book and, what ever ah thank you amy okay, uh, these things can be experienced through meditation right so amy's case if she settles and goes in her finer uh can, have a light show there in a finer dimension, uh so it's not just you got to be in a dream or a sleep or uh, rack your car up so you end up in the hospital uh these things are available straight away through meditation just properly i'm not sure what some people do when they meditate i think they, they, get a quieter mind and then they start to think in the quiet mind but they're still in the mind and he debunks that okay previously his experience the brain the brain the brain ran everything, everything and suddenly he realizes wait a minute his brain was totally shut off and he's having all these experiences that were like mind-blowing and the information that was there that he absorbed uh was mind-blowing you said years and years of going to the university and studying and reading and all of that it was nothing compared to how he was experiencing in those finer dimensions uh there's an immense amount of absorption of knowledge and experience uh anyway got lost somebody, you bumped in any dead relatives lately where are you um let's see add to it but my backup crew here are you there i mean there he is uh, i think you mentioned last week your buddy died yeah so his buddy died and he's feeling this urge to hook into him dialogue with him hang out with him uh so he's, playing with that, and uh and that can be done that's i think mention if not in a book in one of his in, lectures, uh, where, uh, a loved one whatever is dying and you could, at that point go along with them in their experience again it's just a dimensional you go finer dimension and you're not stuck to this world here the hospital room to travel along with them to help them out if, you're smarter than they are but anyway to go along and experience what they're experiencing not unusual, ah, anyway a lot of interesting stuff in the book, and in his lectures i really like this realization of how limited the brain is how wow it is it's a hell of an instrument in the domain of a human being it's a hell of an instrument but the things that we want to do other dimensional can't be picked up by that level he is really, expounds on, that okay um, can i say it better he says things fairly well can i say it better, uh, to let me think about other dimensions let me think about a reincarnation let me think about that forget about it forget about it it's kind of kind of okay uh, to get to get to move through the dimensional walls big, potential interference the dimensional walls to move out of the brain control experience at that level let's say everyone's normally a two by two or a three by three or whatever they're sort of locked in a bit to that level there are dimensional walls but they're pretty easy to pass through once you sort of catch how they work okay they're really paper thin is how i used to present it they may look like a brick walls and oh my god i can't pass through but they're really ah and you're passing through it it's no big deal when you realize kind of like how thin they are it's, no big deal after a while you get faster at it you, might feel the bump of crossing over but it's not a wall that stops you for forever for some people or for a week and eventually adjust to it and you're able to pass through uh you begin to realize how thin they are they may still notice them but in no way are they blockages almost like road signs are now entering arkansas, now you're entering west virginia they're road signs they're not meant to stop you okay but some people get stopped they really get locked into their two by two world or their three by three world or therefore by our world they really get stopped and locked in it's unfortunate it doesn't have to be so, okay some because of the tightness of things the one by one can't take that anymore and they do something to move into a two by two okay, others move into a four by four and they're pretty good their top guy in their neighborhood whatever okay they're special okay uh they're very known, and there can become their blockages like whoa i don't want to go any further here, i've got it all okay so a lot of people who develop get stopped by the specialness of their development i could name names but i won't go there not your name but some other names that you would recognize ah well wow that mean anything did i follow an intelligent pattern there yet essentially this is lauren yes and um you know i've had a personal experience of let's say being a three by three person suddenly thrust you into four by four situation and feeling out of my depth and depth and i'm crazy by the way out of my depth if you don't know how to down time and know what depth and roots are and have some experience there you are out of your debt well i, was at this moment out of my debt and debt and you know and so it, leads to it it's a sense of panic you know at least in my case at that time and i wonder if uh as we think about crossing over you know that fear of being out of your depth of being you know uh you know is what is what gives us uh i don't want to say a natural fear but a common fear yeah, yeah okay i think let's um justin brought up very good point uh what practices uh that we use normally or should be using normally sort of our basics uh would help one in this crossing over process and it's like any and all okay don't panic get easy uh, let things unfold don't be in a rush let things unfold okay but things unfold uh it will clarify has to clarify it will unfold just easy i don't still like that word easy, easy, let things unfold if it's dark which will show uh along the way cool take advantage of it down time down time in the dark and at a certain level there'll be some oh the light world will be there so, the dark down time to the light world that will show at a better, dimensional level better vibrational level however you want to say it uh boom and it in his pattern his pattern, he says he says i'll find a page after bit and read it uh but he caught on a bit to that pattern uh where it was dark his first one he calls underworld he's still he's in his first heavy downtime it's really thick okay and uh he's not really aware of himself as a self, but he's aware he's in his dark thickness, and after a while in the dark thickness he started to panic a little bit i went out of here and as soon as he said i want out of here then it suddenly boom into the light world and whoa the light world was beautiful, really gorgeous colors and whatever and whatever really nice uh as he continues through his experience for that he had a seven-day experience i believe uh he caught on to the pattern there it seemed like where he went down time and then boom the next level of light world showed so it was even better okay he noticed if he had any questions on something uh he sort of would go down with the question and boom the answer would be there experientially answered okay, not words you hear and you got to figure out you sort of are soaking in that knowledge it permeates you kind of thing okay i was in my experiences if i bumped into another, soul another self uh you don't sort of stand 10 feet away and say how you doing what have you been doing you sort of it's like you're passing through each other and in that shared experience i know everything they've been experiencing and they know everything i've been experiencing it's like a an exchange of shared experience stuff like that anyway uh so tricks that we should be used to used to i think the basic one basic is the down time, easy, uh susan i were tracking a guy a patient of hers who died she really liked this guy she wanted to track him see how he was doing and uh we picked him up uh his relation with the dark and he was okay with this big dart that he was in and, the sense we got from him his experience in the dark was almost like my feeling was like a parachute softly floating downwards through this dark and he was really kind of okay with it and then he finally got to his level of light it was a beautiful dimensional level really i don't know how to express these very bright and you know wow that's really nice so this not panicking in the dark it's okay, okay, and then the doctor said uh that uh in his continuing experience it was like being uh at first a child in that dark icky but as he hit it again and then experiencing better light world and then hitting it again uh that, it wasn't scary anymore there's a lot of nice things to it okay nice things in the dark right uh so the, going dark downtime is a good trick okay good trick so if that happens to you, easy, it's okay, okay the, better, longer deeper, the better longer, deeper, the better longer deeper into these kind of experiences the better level of light you can experience, okay, now if you're afraid and you cross over and there's a lot of dark shows in here yeah quite likely uh in my terminology we call it uh oh go back in line it's like an airport line and you stand in line as soon as you get an open seat jump into being a person again reincarnate but real fast or as fast as the line will allow you but, no interim time to, hit a better zone have a sense of how you live and how you should live in your next life and square away better so that in your next life if you choose to do that you don't have to if you choose to come back again by taking the time to square away develop, experience in a finer level then when you come back you're coming in as a better, self-soul therefore your character will probably function better and, and do better things, did i almost say that okay i don't know i get lost here in my words yes, all right so don't panic easy it will unfold uh the doctor had somebody who came and helped him this beautiful, girl and i think she first showed like kind of, a glowing white and then she showed herself as a person and she became his guide okay so she would help him uh to bing, and kind of point things out for him help him with his basic tricks of the trade uh so, he had a beautiful guide companion anyway something like that uh, so there are different jobs so if you're really kind of lost and you say help i need some help here easy, something should happen to help guide you, okay, when my mother after some years i don't remember the time i don't do time uh but she died and a long time later she came to me that already surprised me it's not like my mom would do something like that very independent type anyway and she said i'd like to move on here and i, can't seem to i think about moving on but it doesn't work and so i introduced her to the active under half the what we call the body here the experience of that part so it's not just the idea it's the experience and i introduced that to her get, this two beat let's call it at that level get this two beat and then as you're more balanced with both of those the ha and the hay then you can pass through and i haven't heard from her since okay so in that case i was a helpful guide okay and i had a couple other experiences like that where people would say help me i'm a bit lost uh but if you're stuck and you settle in easy uh you, can ask for help or some people that's their beings that's their job okay uh so they're receivers then they'll be other people's job is to help you ah he, likes the example because he was he liked jumping out of planes as a hobby i guess he wasn't a paratrooper i don't think now uh he was a pilot or whatever he was uh anyways but he had this sense in, some of his experiences where it was like uh jumping out of a plane i thought well that's cool uh we used to think of uh reincarnating, as jumping into probably now we say the vortex of creation into being a human level okay so that sense of jumping is, uh is kind of cool uh anyway, again am i getting lost there on this stuff, help, help, pope so easy, don't panic take your time ride the ride things will unfold you need some help say hey say hey somebody help me hear somebody clarify this, okay i used to do that in my meditations if i reached a dimensional barrier okay and i would like to continue on but i think couldn't seem to get through it uh one trick i asked for somebody to, who, had gone through this level who was a semi-pro at passing through that dimensional wall so to speak and, something i don't remember it's been a lot of years but uh somebody would kind of show their, process i don't know maybe they would show a deeper easy be deeply easy and then they easily just pass through oh thank you i'll be a little deeper easy deeper easy and then i would pass through so there's all kinds of help uh just don't run them up easy settle let it unfold it's, it's beautiful the way it's laid out a couple of tricks to learn but nothing much you know a couple of tricks uh dimensional walls aren't meant to lock you in but they could look like it to some people okay dark oh dark is bad no, it's the hidden part of the nutrients of the underworld okay it's a very important piece i don't know even what he's done i don't want to put him down because he's cool guy uh but i don't know if he brought that out clear, enough the, fuller of the experience, see a lot of people think they can see it and they're aware of it you know and, they say ah i'm having an experience i'm talking about a fuller experience, fuller including that whole underworld as part of the experience okay, so in a certain way if you use the dark and then move back up into the upper light world after a while i would like you to catch on that on that you use the dark and then you move into a finer dimension there and then you include the under rule at a finer dimension which will include the upper awareness naturally okay i have you do it with one of our simple practices let me see when we stand i say okay we're moving from a one by one to a two by two to a three by three okay easy now, we're starting to uh, some activities going on in the three by three easy and then you start to catch there's a center here or there's a walls or a circle a sense of energy moving around something moving something being narrow okay, and now the character starts to form now what i always have said to you people is as the character begins to form don't think about who you are it's too soon feel who you are that's a body for like the word at that level body feel yourself and feel yourself more fully and as you feel yourself you'll be aware more your philosophy of life will be there your take on things will be there so that will be included but i always urge people to have the experience at the lesser level using the body for example the experience of that before you go too quickly mental okay i didn't want you to become a major in awareness and zilch with the truer of this underworld the chore of the underworld is uh, he mentions it let me see that was in the first part of the page hang on a second hello okay this is his first uh his first experience boom this uh thick dark hunter okay and as he hangs out there uh, he said he didn't have any words at that time but in retrospect he would have called it primordial okay so remember he's in a first heavy level the first, heavy level the first approach to under primordial being that right oh i thought that's cute because i remember my early practices of going dark for a while it was happened really early i wasn't sure how things worked uh there yet was i was like going backwards i'm going to become a caveman and even something before that primordial uh so for a moment my thing i, worried about that for a bit holy because i, had come from an upper meditation style beautiful the angel acquired beautiful suddenly i'm researching what the hell is this underworld okay, and when it started to go uh a primordial flavor it was like whoa in a certain way that can't be right but again i'm a researcher so i hung in there and it worked itself out uh, that's just the heavier dimension of it if you were to go finer dimensions it will explain itself which is what happened to him so his second or succeeding go around with under the under got nicer and nicer and nicer of course, uh, but there's a little bit more there anyway, so primordial this is cute another thing that happened to him in this first sense of dark that he bumped into uh it said even smelled like feces okay it smells like got it well that's not new to your folks what is the fir what's the first example i might use to you it's manure as we go dimensional finer soon it's fertilizer a little bit different than manure and certainly a little bit better and so all right we go finer and you get something like oh this is life-giving nutrients okay so here he's bumping into the heavy the uh, the uh, sort of the ugliness of the dark under you mentioned snakes a certain way or some kind of weird things i sense he calls it a worm's eye view yeah, yeah so he knew when he was down he had a sense of things he called that worm type yeah but he did bump into all kinds of scary things at first but again you folks no dimensionality the chance of you bumping into such a thick dark are very slim very slim remember this is like in a certain way it's first time okay they're really showing them the heaviest level as he starts to gets the beats of dark to light and light back to dark the trade into more and then the experience like world boom body of more uh he doesn't have that fear anymore here the movement around me became less visual and more tactile as if reptilian worm-like, creatures were crawling past occasionally rubbing up against me hello that's the snake story hello okay when i first was my early time in playing with under uh sitting down and suddenly snakes the hell the hell i'm in the meditation what are snakes doing here biting me jesus i hang in there because i'm sitting for a meditation here okay i'm a researcher so i sit with it easy now let them bite and they did got even a little bit worse it was a snake pit oh god shakes of gunga din if you remember that movie uh anyway that's an old one uh before your time uh and as i begin to easy and dimensionally go finer easy was this really easy then the snakes became spiraling energies oh and before that they started to smile at me oh then they became spiraling energies and they came from a beautiful source that's dimension on finer and finer uh so uh so he doesn't know that trick at first so he just hits the murky, murphy, murky every level is, still the heavy little uh, but you won't be affected by that could you know easy settle open with a natural what's the finer of this okay, all right all right if you in your own head hear something negative like you're talking to yourself and you say uh i don't know you're, stupid oh, i play a game oh that's what i heard at whatever level i'm at that i'm stupid okay, now i don't hang out here forever well am i really stupid how stupid am i gonna should i go back to school whatever i, don't hang out there i, register i heard, i'm stupid i'm stupid i might register my a quick moment of feeling that but then my game is say what meaning okay easy a finer dimension now what does it say in that case i'm on a lineage and i know your stupid lineage and i, backtrack it easy say what meaning inferring at a finer dimension what are you saying let me say something i don't know like uh, sometimes some of your uh decisions are wrong or something okay, uh oh okay i continue easy finer, say what at a finer level what's that same line saying okay and it gets better and better and better uh, so you take the heavy and you learn the trick of backtracking with dad so little tricks like that, should be natural for you and hopefully you play with some of these things hopefully that any of those will hold you in good stead as you cross over okay, and by the very nature of the beast by the nature of your, basic it you know uh you're not one by one people not, that we don't end up there now and then potentially but your normal level is not two by two your normal level is three by three and plus, plus and some of you have meditated and experienced through the meditation finer and finer of yourself okay, uh so you won't run into heavy bad stuff okay but if it looks like it be easy let it clarify easy, let it unfold easy, okay you're moving into finer dimensions it can't go wrong it's that's you know one by one things are a bit tight two by two a little bit more breathing room three by oh i can start to move and kind of move nice four by four holy i should have been a ballet star and oh my thought patterns are so much clearer and ah things that used to puzzle me are suddenly very clear to me oh that's the law that's the law that's the law okay so you don't have to get locked in at any level you can choose to move on all right all right remember in at a florida diane diana's story of uh trekking her grandmother and her grandmother was ready to stop at a certain dimensional level because it was nice, but her grandfather had died previously was helping her out and he said no honey keep moving so instead of her stopping at this first time oh this is nice he said no we can move on another level she says oh this is really nice okay and he says no honey let's move on okay so he knew she could do better and he wanted probably some companionship but he had real carry for and he wanted her to go to a better level where they could both hang out would be my, guests, couples do that now and then they want to continue hanging out injured souls or something, anyway so that was a good story uh diana uh, but uh but uh you individually have to have the desire to move on to finer and uh have within your system your sense of things uh knowing even when you cross over that you can move on finer and finer okay you don't have to immediately go back in line to be another human being again now take advantage of this time if you do want to come back fine but take advantage of the in between time in a finer dimension to continue to develop, so that if you do decide to come in again you're coming in much better much better okay so i keep telling you the story about nikki the uh, most of you know him uh but loved the acting wanna really be a great actor and didn't make it this life worked hard but didn't make it when he passed on i was happily uh tracking him a little bit and he would just develop and develop and develop because he wants to come back on for being a great actor so all things considered you know he's what are correcting some of uh whatever he has to correct about himself he's probably choosing better parents nearly to be born in, london or hollywood, uh he'll choose more careful and he'll present himself better uh because he's developed how things work a bit better he took advantage of that, it's a shame if you don't take advantage of a what's called an astral plane a better dimensional level improve that you come back too fast uh and that's you know yeah okay whatever but too bad you, could have come back again uh at a better level sometimes i, think i understood when i was interested a little bit in reincarnation stuff uh that if somebody uh died unexpectedly young let's say, wartime where a lot of guys are getting killed and sort of wasn't their time but that's where the bomb landed uh got a little pissed off about being taken out of life and they really wanted to come back fast but some of them and coming back fast didn't choose, their next life location parents whatever, as properly as they could have so they, they jumped too fast and didn't take advantage in quite likely made it worse for themselves a certain way i mean it'll work out in the long run all comes out in the wash of the great creation but uh what a shame what a shame, what a shame just be easy take advantage easy don't panic continue to improve self, self, itself can improve you see self we shouldn't think of self as because i can say that word on sunday this original god self it's dimensional okay, uh you can get faster at that and catch on you can get very fast with it there's no sense it was fast all right so you have to play a bit with that dot to get the flavor of how things work eventually he caught on with some very fast boom very original pure soul pure presence whatever words you want to use boom and that would be there so when we saw this wild stuff going on that was mathematically impossible or unbelievable that came from this inner finer being there supporting the world he's in okay, so i was laughing people thinking keep practicing keep practicing one day i'll be as good as no sensei not in doing bad it's this inner work that he did okay i was always amused even in my early, years in tokyo of seeing guys thinking well since i've got 50 years and if i practice for 50 years i could be it's good or close to sensei and i would just laugh i decided ain't gonna happen you know since they caught on to this major, movement anyway okay uh it's kind of dark for me in here uh, what's good the sun would go down a bit faster sun is going down a little bit faster again this is early stage in the first oppressive dark uh and he wanted out of there uh it's kind of like a sort of sense of where should i go and uh being instantly started to head towards the, light world okay the better dark you can do the better dimensional level it will bring you to or you can experience that level world okay if you're smart you'll eventually your call here trade that one in go dark again under deep and that will bring you to an even better dimensional world so you can move along okay i talked to henry cono on the other side those of you don't know henry buddy of mine in tokyo uh canadian, uh citizen um and he passed on and he's got a little group on the astral plane he's on the level dimension he's on he's got a little group he stands out a little bit special so he drew a group likes to teach uh, and i said uh henry how do you get your, people your group to move on or how do they move on something like that and he said well one problem is when they, if they even think about it there seems to be a little upsurge like dark starts to be there and they freak out they don't know what to do with dart because they're in this beautiful humming vibrational level and if they think about moving on suddenly dark starts to show i don't know what hell to do with it okay so again be comfortable with down dark it's okay, practice it should be part of your basic meditation thing anyway down dart using that as a trick to get to a finer dimension, that you can be present in, your meditation space you can use the same pattern, down time easy a couple of other forms but that's a major the dark one's a major okay where are we you mentioned that one time that when henry showed up on the other side it was as if he had a tan he stood out in that way because of all the grounding and rooting work he'd done on this side yeah he had enough grounding, where when he passed on he retained the sense of that so when he hit an astral plane it was comfortable for him uh he was a little special so, i don't know if he brought it up or somebody brought it up that it's like he's got a tan so, other people said oh who's that guy with the tan he stood out a little bit they knew he was a little bit past the norm so he attracted a group he's a group leader okay so yeah um he mentions uh, the importance of letting go of a level to get to another level hang on and find a page here 79. okay the penetration of the higher worlds to move into finer dimension myself i don't like the sense higher worlds i like the i like the finer worlds that are here within this concentric circle whatever i like to keep it more here and now okay uh anyway uh so not the adam he's a cool guy but so moving along into finder tends to be a gradual process and requires that the individual release his or her attachments to whatever level he or she is on before going higher or deeper you can't get pregnant if you're pregnant now don't language you have to you can't move into robert if you're hanging out to bobby papi's gotta whatever sit with bobby feel bobby bobby's whatever attitude whatever and a minute too just to establish bobby and then trade him in down time bobby sort of dies now bobby's afraid of dying i don't know i don't know he'll fight, but there's a little trick you can use to uh to uh i don't know maybe play again we'll just take a rest and while you're resting boom going deeper and there'll be a robber there, but again hard for robert to be more fully present if bobby is there no, actually this is another dumb story which i can't remember but like trying to bake cake but you got a cupcake inside the cake it sort of interferes with the cake being a cake because of this obstruction if bobby is in the way robert can't really be there and if you do a half of bobby checking on robert it's uh it's a little screwy a little screwy a lot of things you're going to say and see our because it's bobby's cake and, bobby's limitations so he's only going to be certain easy bobby easy treat him in boom robert and robert's got to trade in for nado okay one trap in finer and finer, is uh you get so rich famous powerful whatever you're special and you won't want to move along you got it made you won't want to move along, all right so certainly at that level those that do tend to be more special there's not that many of them let's say because a lot of people will stop at success at that level okay is that did i say that okay, so these are things that you have to have a sense yourself should have a sense and they'll carry on through tricks of the trade if it's a if you just try to remember with your brain as he says being you won't be able to pull it off because the brain is going to die out there, that level of you but self what's he called self he uses uh, soul no i'm sorry consciousness soul, spirit, these are the three words that he uses for that, i call self but in my but in my use of the word self i also get better uh, self uh possible truer self truer self so i have my words that i used i used he has his words to explain so we're talking about the same stuff in the same arena so it doesn't god damn matter exactly what words to use it is what it is okay it will experience it as it experiences uh but words are important to the brain guy, okay i've got the word i got it no you're the brain guy you're in a mental one by one you ain't going nowhere except maybe more expanse you learn more words i'll give you a dictionary shut up leave me alone where you going with that okay, so if you want to move along dimensionally you got to know not to get trapped in that those levels he says it very clearly in his lectures and book okay, and here's a guy who thought the brain was everything, it ran everything and somebody's going oh my god that's totally wrong okay so fun hearing it from a intelligent expert on brains so let's go of yeah if you're say you pass over and you love your family or something and you're concerned you're very interested in your hanging, after a bit it'll happen naturally but you can't hang on to them you can't hover around like this nice ghost okay, uh, and there should be a natural disengaging they're probably uh bobby's memory involvement or roberts or another his involvement with the family uh yes yeah i love them but there should be something naturally happening to say come on let's move along come on let's move along, come on let's move along okay, so i don't know if it's really possible, to hover over a loved one as your location permanently uh be real strange don't ask me about ghosts who are famous ghosts in the english castle who've been there for 300 years i don't know i don't care i'm telling about you okay so there'll be that time of interest if in fact you have interest but that natural happening of i gotta move on that should naturally happen my actually okay and there and there if you bump into a deep dark take advantage of it take advantage of it take advantage of it soaking it easy no rush easy you reach a certain level bing it'll open up to a light world okay, now you've sort of got the trick no matter where you are if you down time you can reach a better level okay, i think he used to use it for questions uh as he was getting comfortable with everything but he'd have a question and i, believe he said uh there's this boom bang and then a knowing of the answer not just words coming at him again but an experience of a, blend with like the answers would pass through him and be an experience so even with uh how does that work boom oh, and how it works is starting to be present showing how it works so he you would use that uh short forms could we tell you yeah just with having a question anyway these days he's pushing meditation, it's, critical, and what he calls centering prayer i'm not sure what he's doing with that but i kind of like the word center centering prayer centering prayer right so if i ever bump into something where he's talking about centering prayer i would look at it i would read it myself, just to see how he's using that uh oh he likes himself he likes the harmonics the vibration sound of things that one touched him a lot okay and again yes it's one of the majors not the only one but one of the majors okay um and he likes that in fact i think he's uh has a little using that as some kind of teaching model to help people get into the finer of themselves he's using that model and presenting that model i believe is what i think i heard someplace okay so uh i'm gonna take dark to light he says cute little things in there uh the little voice in your head goes on so he, but that's the little voice of the brain activity voice uh but he's not talking about that voice when he talks about whatever what i would call self that's why i brought you from remember one of the earlier maps that i laid out uh, what was it they thinking brain easy feeling easy, finer, feeling finer sense of feeling continuing finer and finer i think we're about there we brought in the word sensing, sensing okay now this is where the presence of self can begin to show a bit here's the beginning of self actually showing and you begin to sense, okay, all right all right now you have to be honest with that you have to fun with a little bit so you don't think okay i'm gonna quiet my mind now i'm sensing no you're still in the bing being mine don't me don't yourself okay, then you can me i'll walk away eventually, but don't yourself that's too sad, okay, so, hang out with these things experience these things experience the different levels of these things basic meditation i hate to even say that word because some people just quiet their mind a bit and think and they call that meditation, meditation, meditation is when the self can begin to activate show its presence anyway so i, think the as a smart guy i think he lays out stuff uh pretty good um if you have an interest again that's his uh even alexander.com and i think he has everything all the books that he suggests and there's ads of them out there these days uh, and i think he can probably direct you to, some of the lectures that he did that were taped and stuff nice sometimes instead of reading and samuel says nice to watch the guy talk, as opposed to reading where are we one thing nice he said heaven is all around us okay, and that's what i was saying before about i sort of don't like this gods up there or finer levels up there i would like i would like you all to get a sense of dimension is finer here okay find them here it's more here, here fine and the vastness is here okay, in finer dimensions it's vast the original space would be fast it's here, here, here, here, here, okay, um play with it if it interests you okay it's your time we got a few minutes if you want to hang out if you don't get off my screen anybody anything uh we're finished with uh passing over i think i think we gave you a couple of clues and stuff you deal you're cool people you'll deal with it when it happens just be cool easy sensei you mentioned um the pros uh asking for guidance um help along your, your, your, journey um and examples would, come, and then another word you mentioned really uh resonated with me during your class today about being comfortable and taking advantage of the in between for your development and it reminded me of the tibetan book of the dead an early, book on this process of, being comfortable in the between spaces um between asleep and awake and just sort of hanging out there, as an analogy for the, between when we pass beyond this, realm into another realm we're passing from one dimension to another there's a you know between and that culture finds that, their culture can dig that form there's not a little trick, that, form probably not my best shot okay, i would either go further past that or i'd fall asleep get heavier or get finer but for a culture that was presented it was presented well yeah it's a trick to give them a step one or, or you got to go through a little kindergarten grammar school high school okay so uh when i lay out simple things don't dismiss them because it's it it's like we do a baby step or two and with a one by one to a two by two to a three by three or a bad day fair they could do whatever uh yes they may seem like baby steps but you've got you you're stepping and if you keep stepping you're gonna cover a mile and if you keep stepping you're gonna cover 10 miles not that there's distance here it's a metaphor so but don't sell the simple steps out um talking about sensei about his morning prayers he said well you know sometimes you wake up, in the manifest of course of course okay now he said not though you've mapped that out quite well uh so you wake up in the two by two or uh three by three and he says of course then in his morning prayers uh he would start his he like down that was one of his majors not the only one but one of them he would do the down time style to a finer a finer and had the impression he did more than one level of that down time to finer down time to finer and the finer level of self that was there, uh, till i don't haven't gone over this anyway so he had set that up so during the day if he needed to function better he could instantly or really quick go ahead and this finer level of self would be there, underlying all the activity okay bob did i say that okay yes i'd say yeah yes, yeah, uh so uh, so uh anyway to be aware there are dimensions, each one having a membrane wall get used to the simplicity of moving through those we've done that over one by one we take time we take slow at first, easy settle down now we're moving into a two by two easy but, and then a three by three later those are fast but fast isn't a fast idea don't misunderstand oh yeah i got it no you don't that's the idea that's not a, sense of the ha, speed, speed, okay, uh, if i need an energy arm for some reason okay it's in a very simple just an energy dimension no big deal here uh um this is bobby of the physical hey, okay, some amount of energy here so it doesn't take a day and a half to move into the next dimension even though that was a small step but to start to catch oh my that's there and then later you might want to move into faster bigger okay i told you a story in meditation once i had an hour schedule i would sit for an hour okay that was my meditation usually now i have other days where were special i did three hours or most a day or something weird time anyway but my basic was an hour and one day i had an important apartment i had to go to so i only had a half an hour to sit but suddenly i got to the same for like a words nice level that i was used to after an hour and i got to it in a half an hour and that caught my attention what the hell, so i begin to play with it i'd say okay now you only got 20 minutes and i did 15 minutes i don't forget whether i got darker 10 minutes whatever lo and behold i could get to that same better level in short, periods of time okay, meaning sometimes we can be a little bit slow a little procrastinating and whatever, whatever, so again not to misunderstand with an idea of yes there is better yes i'm there careful but that's why those first basic symbols are important because they, give you the right sense, direction, flavor, okay, all right bread not from the back this is an up-centered practice oh yeah there you go push good come on thank you okay don't came for me guys that's why i'm on this case don't take for me i need honesty here okay, easy okay easy ah a feeling of being more centered okay let me try it at this level a bit better but it's going to break but a bit better i could feel it he could feel it right easy, next level deeper rooted, center deeper okay again it's going to break but it was better so that just gives me a, direction it gives me some experience so later when i do bigger faster moves for like the words i know the direction i know a bit of the flavor of it okay, all right all right and it's not meant to have somebody come in with a crane and see if they can lift you it's just a kindergarten practice or a grammar school practice to make sure we're on the right track okay that's all that's all right, um, and if you get broken don't get pissed off, don't be dumb it just means you probably shifted to an idea about being centered and that's not it it's experience of center and we're just trying to clarify that because you begin to think your idea of center and you get pissed over and you get pissed at me i've had that happen how dumb can you be how sad that is i'm not pushing you over to make you look bad we're saying where'd you go did you go to someplace else because we need you here in this manner it's all we're trying to do why are you trying to fake it with your belief, or i read a book about century therefore it should work because i read i read whatever, i'm finishing up anything, amuse me with great insights help uh sensei bob here you mentioned this centering prayer that's a system developed by a uh an abbott from the trappist monastery his name's father thomas keating could you say the first word bob i missed the first words or what he was an abbott no, what's the style what we're talking about centering prayer, oh silent prayer uh self-centering centered prayer yeah that's the same that's your prayer yes evan alexander mentored centering prayer the centering prayer that you said that evan alexander talked about is that what you're talking about bob or did you change no that's what i'm talking about okay yeah so he developed this system uh over a period of time he's a very active medical guy used to have a zen master come to their travis monastery which was in, massachusetts to teach them how to do zen and stuff it was very interesting that anyway he developed this system of centering prayer, okay and i don't know if that's the same thing that he's or if he came up with the word i don't know so just to be just to be uh just to be careful and say ah he's doing exactly the same thing we don't i don't know how he's using that i don't, know how he's using that i don't know what he's doing with that so maybe yes maybe no so whatever we'll see show me your face again adam listen i know you're there i saw you i'm here there you are okay i have to find you on my put your pictures here uh, i want to i want to get into your stuff one day uh, inner, easy settle inner self has a self alliance better here itself is not an idea floating up there is we really want it here as self is more properly positioned here the radiations for lack of work from the self, can radiate through the body to your world and have a nice effect on things okay i mentioned this to you before i'm just reminding you okay that yourself has a real interest in the acting stuff right uh so take advantage uh sit with it make sure it's aligning better so it's not just an idea it's not just a voice floating around sort of bitching at you being an actress what are you doing kind of thing let it position very important let it position so the power of it the aliveness of it make up a word the glow of it can really radiate through the body that's the work me and susan are doing with, medical patients double checking their selves to see if we can get their selves to position better to get a healing effect through, all the layers of the body to get proper healing in this case uh that radiation in, your case will produce a better uh physical character and it even goes out a little further it improves the world you're in so things will begin to click better so it takes care of the center in the circle of things or the character in her world of things to be the actress in the world of acting you know whatever uh so i'm just reminding you i don't wanna i wanna i like your case it's a i find that interesting uh i'll check back with you another time thank you let's see i see one of those funny guys from new zealand is mike gonna say anything before we leave um that's very interesting that you picked on me um do you i'm sure you know the name carlos castaneda is it um talk to jack water i'm, not a no i'm i he's he was his books originally when i was at the very beginning of this journey in just, my very early 20s really rocked my world but just in the last couple of weeks because i'd run out of anything else to read and this book was kind of just sitting there looking at me i picked up a more recent book of his and it's just amazing how much of what this particular book is talking about at this particular time aligns with what you're talking about that's why the book was looking at you i know i know and similarly i had obtained from another guy a whole series of audio recordings of um terry dobson and his stuff and talking about our sensei and it is just um yeah the synchronicity is amazing because i, kind of need that help at the moment um yeah, but yeah it's just amazing how the stuff is available to you if you notice that it's there when you need it yeah i usually use that in tokyo i'd walk into there at an english bookstore and down in begins i believe and if i had a question uh about something uh that didn't feel appropriate to bounce up about sensei uh i would walk into this bookstore walk around let my hand pick up a book i would even sometimes look at the book i would just pick it up and buy it i'd go home and skim it bean there it was whatever my question was there it was clear as hell so that was a practice game for me you said the book was looking at you and i should walk through and wait for it to jump in my hand so to speak it's fun it's fun oh it is yes and it's uh well i got a great feeling of gratitude actually that um, that, happens because um yeah it's, um it's important to take it well not to take it it's important to be open to receiving help when you need help basically yeah, i have to practice with that because my normal state i, don't allow things a lot of compliments allow, being tipped uh a lot i, was a little tight on that i'm getting better at it and i'm trying to be more open to that that's part of being open to the circle of things but anyway blah, different discussion hey people time to go huh thank you so much sensei thank you everyone thank you mike cashwell for being the last one to speak

kenny, kenny i just want to look at your head wow got it wow, well like i said if we're showing off wow, oh my god don't do that to us richard we can't we can't i'm just trying to prepare you for the future bob i didn't even realize that was kenny uh yes so girlfriend um hello everyone good evening and uh we're coming up on uh 36 after the hour sensei is almost ready uh please stand by ken do you have your mic now i show you unmuted oh really i missed that wow um, had to happen sometime huh okay, so uh ken's gonna moderate tonight and i'll turn it over to him okay, uh thanks everyone uh we're still waiting for sensei to give us the go ahead i want to remind everyone that um donations are uh accepted following, the successful roy johnson i'll say think about buying your buying your teacher a cup of coffee and having a chat with so i think we are ready to go and uh yep i see a camera and, sensei you're on in case the viewers didn't recognize that was did they hear me on that, was kenneth crone in case you didn't recognize him with his new hairdo it hasn't been this short since i was a teenager, yeah ah good evening good evening good evening good evening good evening okay let's uh spend a few minutes here whatever on last week's what did we do last week uh playing that the qualities in your system energies [Applause], can push us tight also they pull back into finer and find it finer so as you get kind of a sense of that of that to be you get to work with it better you can find certain balance points in between the push and pull where you can function for a while ah, okay and that one possibility was uh, i think we tried to touch on last week was uh recognize the quality that's pushing on you, and so you can maybe use that quality word sense to backtrack into finer and finer of that quality so in the sense catching the quality might facilitate you, in backtracking it to finer is that is that okay so far yeah, um we brought up also and again i'd like to refine this a bit uh but not only do the qualities have a potential to push but the self also has a potential and i uh again i mentioned i'd like to fine tune that i should be able to hear from whatever you say oh yeah that's the self pushing oh that's a quality pushing, oh that's a quality pushing okay, uh no, big deal whoever's pushing if you settle and open and play this say what game and open and feel listen better uh it doesn't matter what's pushing you you'll backtrack to it okay but okay but just for me i like to fine-tune things sometimes um so any comments on, last week the uh in the meeting now there are more than 20 participants in the meeting um what i found so interesting is that, that the, least time i feel like doing any processing, is, precisely that time when i'm getting pushed on i, don't you know i get i get a push and it's like ah i don't want to deal with anything yeah you know i, just kind of want to close my head take a nap do something but, since working with that um, [Music], it turned out that it was like i didn't i don't have time for this you know and but time seems to be a quality, that was coming through and pushing on me, and by taking a few moments and, playing with it sticking with it in spite of not wanting to uh, it opened up to something very big exactly what i needed um oh wow yes oh wow yes yeah that's why we're here pardon me that's why we're here yes, should be so well after 50 years you start to learn steve you have to understand some people are slower than others yeah but it's just such a great reminder that it maybe seems like the last thing you want to do but it's there waiting for you so uh yeah i just wanted to i think the timing there, if you're in the push of it to try to think i've got to do something well you're in the push of it i think first maybe we have to realize we're in a push easy settle open up a bit more so the push can flow through a bit without you going downstream into tighter with it so a little something that facilitates then being able to move upstream, so it's not just being in the middle of a pushing okay i'm gonna go upstream and no it's too strong i think we have to address it deal with it in some form and then and then yeah okay i think i tried to present that in my dumb way uh using a, way if you're a surfer a wave uh or, you got a canoe or a boat or something and you try to launch your boat against a big incoming wave it's kind of stupid isn't it it's gonna pull your ass over right so you begin to recognize the beats and, launch your boat now but not against a big wave you gotta wait, oh there it is now how, do i know there it is i sort of felt that a little deeper could feel like under my tailbone so to speak a little deeper opening there it was there, i could now move into a, little bit bigger level or next level or something is that is that coming across right, yeah, yeah so to be able to uh time things uh i like people sort of get a sense of, the way so even in our again dumb practices don't, disregard the word dumb uh of okay i want to stand better baby okay and here comes the energies to stand better, but one thing i, like to introduce to people is okay i want to stand better now here come the energies wait, it was a little minor ripple medium oh here it comes i can almost hear it roar uh so to recognize whatever that is i'm doing, to know when to move with it uh, when, not to try to go up river when you're being pushed down river wait it up for a moment wait it out that kind of thing yeah say something intelligent steve to finish this up uh well that's uh going to be difficult but let me try i, guess you know what you just said was very helpful uh helpful uh to not you know not just immediately try and go against the tide uh because what i said was you start to recognize that push that's your cue that uh to, start you know at least to, recognize it's time to process there's something going on here but uh to, also recognize that to take a breath take a step and let that wave instead of you know pushing against the tide let the let the thing go through you, it um you know we, talked about uh you know what first seems like a monster uh you know these the push is like a monster to uh it, it, doesn't it, it doesn't feel pleasant it's, not where you say oh i've i'm, ready to process, uh it's, it's uh the opposite uh and, i, i tend to feel uh pretty down on myself when i get into that tight space uh but i found when i opened up the opposite i felt very confident and, uh and uh, ver it was very spacious once i did that, so, and the power of the push at a certain level is liked and joy even at that level i'm not fantastic levels or getting into your people but the pattern follows you're getting the push and power to hit the ball he likes baseball so okay or tennis you get to push in the power to wamp that ball so fast they're not going to be able to catch up to it kind of thing uh so there's certain times where we go oh thank god it's there thank god i need your power because we really needed a home run thank you god or whoever they think okay i think we ran that one into the earth uh somebody anything on qualities from last week or the push into tighter or anything, there how do we talk about something last week that i don't know like if i covered it well anything on from last week that i, i stumbled over uh the lesson was don't try to solve the, the push from a one by because you're only gonna get one by answers out of it yeah uh yeah it's like we get so let's say contorted in a one by to try to figure anything out uh and i should have said it a little clearer last week that we probably should move to the next and maybe even the next where we can oh okay i recognize that push the quality seems to be or whatever the voice himself seems to be whatever you're picking up there uh but to try to pick it up when you're in a contorted it's like i don't think so you're just gonna contort more yeah so i did i don't think i made that clear last week but uh but do a basic settling it's at least to the next level and then sense around for what the push may be saying if not there go one more but definitely not from a tight crazy place no, no, no uh, it won't work well okay all right all right yeah, autumn yeah okay thank you [Applause] okay tonight, uh what is tonight uh space yeah let's go over space, okay, and why i put that in there that's a one by two by three by okay, that we that we touched on space but we did that form of, it we did easy let's get a balance our squared away space we'll call it one binding one it's not quite enough i'm a little strange, potentially i'm a little hunched over definitely my guts pull up in a bit yeah uh, okay, now easy settle open and move into the next space okay the two by two the energies there are there's no more access the energies are a little bit better quality and they mix up a little better character the two by two starts to become a robber i use bobby roberto as the same example he's uh he's not as crazy as bobby he may be annoying but he's not as crazy as bobby and then again okay so we we've used space when we were doing that needed a certain amount of space so the activity in that space could mix up a better character let's say okay a better sense of things whatever are we okay so far now, again tonight i just want to do space as itself reflected experiencing itself i'm, not interested right now in, the mix that goes on in the space so when i'm going for space and it starts to and i can catch a quality or i can't start in the mix i don't care right now no not now i'm for lack of words highlighting space, okay, am i saying this okay i'm not interested in who's into space and who gets mixed up better in the space and is there beauty in the space is there whatever i, don't care i don't care i don't care we're just doing space as itself space did i say that okay are we okay so far sounds good i think i mentioned last time we touch on space uh this is to me for most sense a [Music], lot larger space he'd like a few larger space so we'll follow this pattern and then a few finer space, and then a few a more original space okay and just uh i don't know what to say just do the best you can uh let's say go back as far as you can as best as you can allow more space to be present showing that's sort of okay damn the words in this business also space is not an idea out there remember the here and now of things space is here okay spaces here so even though it's such a the sense of it it's very it's much bigger of course it's not oh it's bigger, of course it's not oh it's bigger out there i'm in a spacious idea uh still a sense of here space, okay, is that is that okay the here and now of it yeah okay all right let's if you want let's, let's play with space now of course in the early stages there's some uh bobby awareness of space robert looking around at the space letter but no, no, no as soon as possible don't pay attention to that we're not interested in that face [Applause] the larger of space easy the larger of space okay let me scrub your practice and interject i knew i was on the right track because i wasn't looking to have my body be the reference for this but in doing this i didn't notice body settling a bit there's some definite, more space things that the body was affected by so i noted that but i don't stay there and say now what's happening in the body i don't major in it i just happen to softly in the background notice the body was affected and it got better with each bigger space this freer sense of things, okay, so that just clues me that i'm on the right track because i could feel it, was just an idea about space i wouldn't be able to really, feel those changes here is that okay so far okay, let's go back one more time because i took it out of the practice a bit easy one more time the space itself getting bigger a lack of words experiencing itself what the hell ever that means space itself spacing easy just have a sense of spaciousness and i, do this to remind me that it's here but more open space is here it's not just up here okay all right all right so far so good next series the finer of space easier in this larger space shifting to the finer of the space and that prism ah but i don't know what finder of space means yeah, yeah, stop it easy the finer of space easy again continuing the finer of space, is itself and again quick aside i could feel i don't know what to call it some kind of energy kind of little bit uh something i don't know softly electrical in that field was that it space the third in the series easy space fineness of space the more original space more original space, more original space and i don't have to know anything really i'm just i'm just allowing that the more original of space my sense of this is really space as we kind of know it in science fiction movies that but that was my experience my sense of it a lot of dark in there someplace but i'm not going to try to figure it all out this is space's turn to present itself as space bigger finer, and more original okay i don't know if we should dialogue anything there let's, try so i don't know but let's try i don't even know the right words which what's your what was your sense how did space present space as it experiences itself was permeable to itself good out loud okay, so for me oh a strong emphasis on the openness of it yes that's how i would word it but sounds like you're worthy yes and space has its own intelligence and as it experiences itself more fully that intelligence begins to really show up yeah, possibly because everything in creation, is aware and experiencing itself but again different topic but probably something like that ah justin how'd you do it space itself with space there was, a sense of clearer and clearer and more open peaceful from one level to the next in that case i might say peaceful in the sense that we're not paying attention to any activity we're passing on that that's not where i'm focusing is a bad word it's not where i'm focusing i'm not focusing on the mix and the character and that dusty did you hear that i'm not focusing on all this nonsense that goes on to create a character you got that dusty okay good boy anybody space, and whatever work like experiences itself means or just space, this is nancy a deep permeability through the most microscopic to the macroscopic yeah this is the space where all that can go on and it's, for there to be a creation it needed a space to create it so yes so whatever is going to go on here and this is the space that allows it all okay, something, like that like that so, yeah the heavier the microscopic this that the great galaxies all that stuff yes, yes, yes space hey, yeah, oh sensei inferred to me that um i can remember, uh infer hang out play with space for it for a bit it should facilitate later when we uh later when we say okay next in the space and where the qualities start to move around energies nutrients all that creating a character uh that having done a goodly space first can facilitate all of that you see we do a two by and we get a better character we do a three by and we get even a better character okay you do big, big space and then if you want to get into what's going on in there it'll begin to show you i think tj's example a week or the week before when whatever about in the big space uh and, starting to get caught up in the spiral of the what i call manifest creation uh there's a lot of beauty there uh teacher young beauty and what was your second one yeah it was um it was expression, or creativity, create yes expression creativity and beauty with that yeah uh because i suggest to any everybody uh one quality could unfortunately spin you off after a bit it's good to get find its partner quality it helps facilitate the balance of things so things so even the beautiful qualities like beauty or love or whatever yeah but, it could get spun off a bit like get two and it seems to balance better this is a trick file it away that's why i make jokes that's how we did not, no level of making jokes uh oh love and then you score every aaron boy every delivery guy every it's like really something's missing i'm nice you're loving but you're scoring every guy in the neighborhood what are you doing or vice versa whoever's scoring uh that, kind of thing it can get out of hand uh so find its partner helps keep things balanced trick of the trade, okay maybe one more somebody something out space something that was i'm finding it to be effortless at first it was easy but then it became effortless yeah, space itself should be, kind of effortless that's why again using my dumb example i'd say to the troops in the in the dojo see this dojo space it's just here now easy a little bit bigger now there's the block space and that space is just here now there's the neighborhood space and on and on and on it's not hard work space is space kind of thing okay i know maybe if you block yourself in to a one by one you can feel that heaviness of those uh dimensional walls of membranes or like cementite and you think you're gonna fight your way out but not really space is space, is space anyway again sorry the words are strange sometimes we don't really have a vocabulary at certain levels of things you know um we do the best we, can knowing no knowing no one word might be perfect okay all right now if there's nothing, more on space sensei it's andreas i have a question yeah uh so i'm thinking it's like wait a minute did you say your house how does how does space relate to somebody to loneliness like if i'm sure they're in a tight space in some manner not necessarily in a tight room but they've tightened things in and they're lonely nobody visits nobody holds their hand nobody calls them they're the results of it of being tight okay but, let's not i don't unless we have to let's not get into these levels i want to stay bigly here tonight big space finer space the more original space i mean it in your system you can do that that's allowed for you okay yeah so don't keep coming back to uh the weird guy and not now not now okay, okay thank you or not today okay yeah one way you recognize when you're being pushed into one by one is spatiality some of you said time it's also spatiality, you don't have room to move around i took my parking place all right the neighbors are infringing they're making too much noise and it's infringing in my space no, no, no, no who'd i cut off somebody wanted to jump in yeah since the antigua here you're there yeah, so the uh in looking at that feeling uh feeling space and then you have in your diagram tonight the uh the one by two by three by which is, our skillful way of, practice but what you referenced there which i appreciated was that in connecting with space you have kind of an instantaneous expansion it's uh you're, connected in a way that, one by two by three by does in a more gradual oh yeah no we have to teach the stepping the steps we have to we have to people okay because a certain amount of how things work and the balance experience that's critical and to not feel your kindergarten level and your early grammar school level uh because you're smarter to this or to that you're going to screw it up i guarantee it i'm sorry i guarantee it i'm sorry i guarantee i don't give a how smart you are or how this and that you are you, don't have a click, click and you need a bit of it not forever it does get finer and finer but i'm not asking you to go find her and find them sign in finder environment i'm not asking you for that i'm saying be comfortable with a certain amount of it not the idea of it the actual ability of experiencing that okay and then we'll see about college work is that okay that's, right it's right spotting yeah great thank you uh so yeah uh, [Music], yeah again remember oh sensei was fast because he had experienced a lot of that kind of thing caught on to bigger sense of things and was able to as teachers say i just i don't have to say cut to the chase space okay but he also told me there are days you wake up and you are kind of tighter so yeah you do a couple of clicks next, to get to make sure all the pieces are there properly and then you can ping start to go big time okay, so yes, okay now uh why i mentioned self how was that written up uh brad you know uh, presence of self space and the presence of self presence i like that presence of self yes okay now [Applause], we'll take another moment to uh re-experience the bigger finer more original space okay, uh the self that's there again we're many levels here okay some of you are a great ahead of somebody else whatever, do the best you can is what i'm trying to say so within hopefully this next piece the self the self okay now different names so i, noticed uh maybe reading the doctors skimming the doctor's book for our crossing over thing uh he uses itself a certain way i think, anyway, self, is consciousness there is a finer self there's a more original self truer self okay i'm just upgrading the word self soul itself so again whatever word you use fine as long as we're talking about the same unit, that's all okay as long as we're talking about the same unit i would surmise you can call it whatever you want you want to say soul okay as long as that word doesn't because you've been brought up to understand soul to mean a certain thing that you don't spin off on that or your use your family juice your religions use uh, put a little twist in it so, again self truer self more original self okay a, big time piece of creation big time just do the best you can see when we were doing a one by two by three by the potential was that a three, by the potential was that a three by four by for the self that was there to begin to show and somehow let you know it's there in some form okay but we're going big as we can doesn't mean the self is going to be its most original pure from god self, do the best you can is all i'm saying is, that okay that i mucked that up with words too, much is that okay, give them a moment again for space bigger space finer of space the more original space okay now, within that space a certain amount of yourself is present okay again make sure we're doing this on a here now okay so if you say self soul or whatever don't float up out there to the heavenlies, here it's here again oh sensei don't go anywhere it's here inner there's an inner journey to the finer of things that are here so in this larger space best you can there is a self yourself is present here, what should we do with that and i really don't mean what should we do with it okay let's not worry about dialogue of self yet or anything like that just this uh, presence of self okay so we have we have a large space a clearer space a more original space as best as you can and we have here the presence of self you see the self itself present now i'm noticing quite a bit of uh is, it here how am i going to recognize it i'll go back to bobby and try to figure this out you're bobby you're robert you're not doe your great smartness is not gonna figure this out i would just like its presence they are like that there we go presence that's why i like the word the presence of self at whatever level we're at let's start the presence of self at this let's say earlier level the presence of self there is a radiant glow okay, a glow easy the presence of self close okay and again in hanging with that i felt a little uh activity warmth through my body i again i, don't care right now i don't care right not only caught up in oh, my body my body screw it myself in the space there's much more room so that more of self hopefully is showing for you, it's presence, is a is a embodied balance okay and body i'm not sure what that means i, don't want to get caught up in too many words it's here autumn, autumn we've got a lot of space stuff is present what's the earlier sense of it you're too far back light, and, kind of this uh harmonizing okay light as an light, yes okay, i may be referring to whoever's glow i don't know what to do the word harmonizing i'm not saying it's wrong or anything i just don't i don't know what to do with it at the moment there's that kind of beat beginning but it's kind of inherent in the space like i didn't have to do anything really to get there yes this shouldn't be hard work it's possible i, don't know a self could be talking about itself and saying when i'm present things naturally harmonize or something like that but i'm also probably putting words in her mouth so i'll shut up somebody you got the game this first sense of a presence of self what's your damn words what's your experiential sense of self if self is present here and now what's yours say something somebody self, radiance, radiant i feel it in my heart i feel a natural supportiveness inherent it's just supportive and nurturing of it's, part of itself okay i didn't recognize the voice who was that nancy yeah supported yeah supportive i've always been here i'm going to call this the evita don't cry for me argentina i'm not finished the truth is i've never left you that's a i love those i never left you i've always been here but you've been so busy being an here you don't have to create me i'm here i've always been here no because you're coming out of kindergarten or one by one i know you can't pick up the totalness of me of me okay and even self at that level doesn't know it's totalness we're in line we're, hooked in i don't know the words okay self okay so some uh so let's say anytime in the future if you set crack for just a moment and say self how would you know if it's there the warmth factor the actual glow factor not a memory not an idea the actual say oh yeah there, there begins so how would you recognize self's presence even though it could be the early stages of it then say i'm feeling a calming ebb and flow like a breath the inhale exhale just presences um it's grounding and calming but it's really all about the even flow of, breath or opposites it could be the breath it could be opposites it could be up and down in and out left and right but it's just a, flow, and what are we looking at hang on don't hit me too much i'll forget but time to get to the end i forgot everything you said in the beginning that's me i'm not well, anyway uh but let's not get careful we're not getting too involved with the workings okay when self is here and you, naturally feel say a radiation and, you notice real quickly you happen to notice a calming tom calmer tom cool but, now listen oh a calmer now hey what should i do now and let's not get let's not lose this in a certain way screw tom in a certain way i want self and more self because when tom is dead and buried this unit is going to be there okay right, and be able to potentially move on into the finer of self that'll be the game you're not finished because you're dead and there's a bit of a self there you're not finished the school goes on okay, also whatever i said tom something in there, ah push ah, i don't know what i wanted to do is just get a sense of its presence okay sense of his presence and i noticed because of its presence certain things that uh where nado gets affected okay that's fine but, but that's secondary major is the presence itself and the more of itself another day i'll map out at this level of presence and self you're going to get a calmer body now at this level of present self you're going to get uh more caring about people now at this level oh i'll map that out but it's not important now, self, self, self, self, self, not selfish self and i just wanted to get a sense of its presence i didn't want to get into dialoguing, stuff like that one thing i felt was if we do things like dialogue some people come around to their body and talk to this thing back here, okay, no it's here i just wanted to have it be here more i'm also by doing it this way establishing its positioning okay uh, remember if a lot of self that i deal with uh are hoverers or they're standing off to the side and they're not quite aligned with their body, okay, so using the body is a certain heavy reference, it's here it's here it's inner finer but it's here i don't know if i said anything intelligent there ah help, bob here yeah self has a directness of experience that isn't two forces it isn't the energies of character it, is its own experience of itself directly, yeah, now you should have brought it up but it does have its own something aliveness not quite the right word, in the bigger levels could we say of self well sensei likes the word vitality oh you just learned a word now you're going to run around and you're robert level saying yes i'm feeling vitality don't you and don't me it's a big time oh sensei word at a certain level of experience okay uh but, that it is in let's call it alive, it is alive it's not just a, white field just hanging there dozing off okay it's, so i myself at this stage again like to use something uh to facilitate its uh its growth that's okay i kind of let it pump or something i use a kind of a pumping sense aware or aware of itself it's experiencing itself experiencing itself it's aware of itself uh so that it its aliveness can, come, forth, can show it's there all right all right uh tom not to be confused with is that the pulsations the breathing of the manifest universe not when i'm highlighting self i'm just trying to get self too see again i bump into self when i work with susan a lot we bump into cells who are just hanging there and they don't produce much aliveness is a hard press they, don't they're sick or whatever broken up or whatever in some form and we're asking themselves to position better, and to be a little more alive there so that their person can uh be affected by this aliveness so they'll glow a bit more things will heal faster okay so i know a lot of these things are similar, and, and, they what's the word smear a lot of things can easily smear because you gotta, you got this overlay, overlay thing going on so sometimes a little hard to say well is that, or is that this okay so that's why i try to be sort of distinct at certain stages okay this is the self now let's not go heavy into what the body's doing or whatever not now this is self when we did space i said this is space yes, qualities and energies are mixing up a character and all that yes, yes but not, now just space okay trying to keep it as i don't know clear as possible whatever again the right words are so, am i screwing this up too badly is this okay so [Music] [Applause] it seems though the words as soon as we attach, a description to that experience of experiencing itself in space it gets immediately how do i say negates itself it's, almost like attaching a word to it to create some meaning and we can attach to that meaning and we lose the sense of present let me jump in on that this is why it's difficult to have a very uh for like a words a very fine inner experience that's like gangbusters and then and then you move out of the experience and you try to tell your neighbor about it what a oh sensei had a of a time you know how can he relate clearly to some real heavy people uh, the, fullness that the fineness the more original of his experience damn hard damn hard and you throw out some stories and stuff you like to wax politically a lot and they screw that all up you're damned if you do and damned if you don't really understand is to have both people be at the same level then to a pretty good degree they can communicate yeah, even though you might well sense it a bit different i, kind of okay oh yes i said that earlier somebody was seeing uh, uh bob remember somebody was open or something allowing that's right and somebody else was uh what was nancy's uh nurturing and supportive yeah none interfering it's a non-interfering space it's maybe like a great womb but at first we just do the womb of it we don't care about the kid getting formed and stuff i'm gonna screw this all up aren't i tom i'm sorry i jumped in a bit you are you anything you wanted to clarify there no i'm, always uh an admiration of how we how you lead the discussion so that we can search through the meaning and search through the meaning of the experience yeah because as uh points out it really is about the experience, that's the, hardest thing to, drop a word on because as soon as you do you lost you lost the experience so it's um but it but nonetheless the, the pioneering of it is all the fun of it so it's, it's the journey is, where it's at notice, the journey and the experience within the journey yes it's kind of kind of fun yes yeah, that's why we're here yeah, okay uh somebody i'm, i, need a little break here somebody anything it's justin i'd like to add that experience of self has a presence, and a radiance to it that's very distinct from the characters, seem to have their own agenda if you will that's very different than the timeless presence, yeah quality of the self yeah but for a bit there's something similar could we say, a guy wins the game and he's just glowing a bit you know that kind of god it wasn't a game and he's glowing uh but this glow is not that close yeah but there's so similar overlaid it's kind of whoa look at that athlete glow he must be a spiritual teacher really maybe but maybe but really anyway thank you likes are open feel free better the space the more room the self hopefully can be present make itself known by its presence be experienced it's present and i gotta be careful me bobby see if i can feel self's presence and i meant to bobby try no, no bobby shut up relax open self itself presence okay you know we got a lot of years of feeling and thinking and figuring stuff out and all of that not now, not, now, they'll be i don't know say offshoots they'll be they'll be things that i said quickly note but i don't get caught up in them and go off on, that because my emphasis my focus bad word because you i think people focus so i don't like that word that word now it doesn't mean you're using the word focus that way you could be just really present with and you would call that focusing but i don't like the word focusing because a lot of people have been trained to focus you know if the teacher up and the blackboard says all right students focus most of them lean forward and stare a little harder, do you really mean that strain your eyes i don't think so anyway damn words we do the best we can ah so self, self where shall we go itself we got a few minutes here self self's presence self seems to glow seems to radiate somehow, self may have some way of i don't say improving itself all right sorry i like deserve a two beat of that let me get i mean the two beat of the universal two beats two beat of the breathing two beats that uh it's within itself beats i like the sense of aware experience experiencing aware that's the mantra of self anything we should do with this i presented the word over self back when in retrospect i don't like that word it's it, puts self up here it's like no it's here it's here kind of like if you could see some, if you could see itself and we had some kind of acid where my body would totally disappear just totally disappear just positioned properly hopefully you should say oh natto disappeared where the hell is itself right here right there right here this sense of its presence and the lineup that goes on and on and on so for some of you heading towards an original heavenly hope you get there uh eventually uh the lineup thing is, is important the awareness people will fight me because they're aware they don't understand why they should be lined up here now they have the words oh yeah here now yes there now yes but the actual see i was all sensei was cool to watch you had this uh i don't know what to call it it's much finer level those aren't even good words that was here in the dojo through this old man it was here and he tried to highlight that it was here it was here okay so even though in the dojo the heavier dimension in the in the dojo the heavier dimension in the world is a heavier dimension he was able to stand i don't want the word yet at the pre of that and function from the pre of that and you'd see this old man do sort of magical things kind of thing it wasn't that old man doing magical things but because of this presence that was there magical things could happen you know many talk about the loving protection harmony uh you can't defeat because as soon as you try to do something that something will happen to balance that out and, that's just happening, not like yet configure it and say okay now i'm going to do this to his that kind of thing uh so anyway maybe we're getting a little too advanced here or maybe let's use a lesser dumber example, you got a bobby and he's standing there real quick process then there's a two by two robert standing there real quick process there's a three by three standing there a three by three guy is different than bobby but he's standing in the same location wearing the same clothes if you check his id yep it's him but it's not bobby him there's something else present so that's a kindergarten example i think of what we're trying to say if that helps kenny that doesn't confuse you too much okay we're moving along mike's open say something because i'm i think i may be running out over here self-self-self okay please get close to your mic i didn't hear anybody kenny who's there somebody nobody you want to finish it uh sensei bob here you were distinctly describing the difference between how self grows and how characters grow you said self grows through its own it's aware of itself it experiences itself, and that process continues and if it continues so maybe growing isn't the right word but it feels more of itself whereas the characters grow through the interaction of the qualities that are coming in to help it reach its next level but should we say that because eventually we're going to get to our type self type self and our type self just has better access to that let's call it purity of the colors that makes him up at which time he has a better sense of himself so i'm not sure that i misunderstand uh probably not yeah come back to me on that during the week, okay people got nothing sensely let's go on sensei yeah fine skip to the chat, what are you what do you want uh this is andrew from sounds like andrew i got you go if once you as you go through bigger spaces you know one by one two by two, by three by three on and on does the character automatically get better or is that a whole different process no, should by law automatically get better i mean what happened when you went from a one by two or two by if you in fact have done that you notice a little bit better character he stands a little straighter a little stronger he's a little clearer he's a little bit nicer, whatever you move on to the next one and lo and behold he's even a bit better somehow or tether okay you do another one whoa same thing why do you think it's only gonna die on you the pattern continues does it matter if you improve the character first or the space or doesn't matter at all ah i think i said a good trick is to open up the space recognize the space the more space the more naturally a better can mix we see we can go one by two by three by and you gotta fight the walls that are there but you're gonna bump into the uh membranes and stuff uh we can skip a lot of that although once you learn this is kind of how it works in the manifest and we can use certain tricks like let's just cut to space more space more space more space and then what assembles at the level of space you could get to and i happened to fall you should get to your best level space you can do in that period of time an hour and then and then easy you want to be somebody okay just say hey i want to be somebody here and it'll mix up a character should be at the level of space that you opened up to it should be something like that okay, yeah, thank you sunset probably could have said it like everything else tonight better but sophia, we finished people thank you sounds like we are thank you so much thank you thank you so much thank you sorry thank you everyone for the screw up last week and no couple people couldn't get on we had a little screw up we had a we had a little screw up we had a session but not in the first few minutes it was scary so sorry you missed it, will be on available soon kenny can you uh yeah absolutely yep it'll go out to the mailing list thank you thank you see you next week yeah, thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you okay thanks everyone thank you bob thank you kenny

more of a space and, uh getting a sense of what kind of space is available in the mornings before i start my day my day i sit on the edge of the bed and i get a sense of what kind of space i might have available and then i settle and open into that space and gain a clearer sense of core afterward rather than doing it the other way around as i, had been for, quite a while and that seems to fast-track more of a connection to available present core here and now not always with a radiance but that there's more of a clearer line there there's more of a clearer line there when i start with space uh this week um yeah i think if we start using the word core i could throw in other words there start with whatever character you think you are in the morning there we're already infringing on space we already set up limitations thus they slow down or kill the possibility of space even so to have more space more space and then as you're finishing now core or core or character, okay, because the better the space the better uh core the better character whatever word you want to use right there better beingness, a better function or whatever so yeah good, catch uh as she is on sensing susan can you hear me if she's behind a mountain she's we're a loser but we'll try susan, here she comes yes sensei yes sensei we're talking a little bit about last week about space and you mentioned to me in our talk uh, that you're getting obvious results from the people the patients that you deal with uh did you want to say something about uh, my sense of it if i remember was uh, you having a sense of being in more space, seeing them in more space and their, dialogue to you has been noticeably different better or something you following me yes tell me what we're talking about here okay, noticeable, in that more people are opening up to about more of their history um history that's pertinent to you know the situation or the problem but, things that they haven't related before and they'll even talk about well i hadn't thought of this before but it seems important who's coming in there sorry sensei i got it now okay did you did you all follow what she was saying, that with this sense of more space she's giving a feedback from her client in that they're laying out more to her more than she's ever noticed before more than ever happened before it's, so strong or happening so often she goes wow something's happening here i did you did you all follow that little conversation yeah, yeah so for example let's say uh she's not a therapist but let's say somebody's into therapy for example and they're, digging on you to find out what your problem is okay, and if they have a slant you may be in trouble because they dig at you a certain way and, do you remember when you're four years old and daddy molested you or something and they're on a kick okay that forget what i just said and, if they caught the trick of openness they're more open being present and they're seeing like a word their client in a more open sense that then the client will gush the important things we'll say the important things we'll say the deep things that they've been maybe holding back or not wanting to kick out it'll be sort of boom there so potentially the therapist won't have to dig and rip it out of them they'll gush it out is that are you following there's a different partners and then whatever other possibilities and being more open and viewing yeah not quite the right word people in a more open set okay susan is that did you want to add anything to that was that it communications up in the with the hill people is strange susan you okay with that oh there we go yes, sensei and, exactly what you were saying where you know i wasn't looking for information or digging for it, it just came out they offered it they presented and sometimes they were surprised and would say oh i hadn't thought to tell you that before i remember a couple of for me humorous ones i think let's see uh, pre-japan but i'm into meditation a bit stuff like that and i'm working a high school dance or something there's an old guy i work in the cloakroom and we got talking and he started to tell me about his son who had died and appeared to him very clearly glowing happy dad i love you kind of thing and, then he said i never tell anybody this i don't understand why i'm telling you this but because i'm already into some, sense of awareness stuff it was amusing to me to me uh so kind of a similar thing i was more open and in my being more open facilitated his being more open to tell me this very personal story that he doesn't tell other people does that fit in here yeah, another one when i came back from japan i'm getting my first haircut in california, and the barber starts talking spiritual things, and he goes on and on and he can't stop himself he tries if he can't and he says i, don't know why i'm talking so much about this i never talked to my clients about this kind of thing i'm sitting there kind of laughing to myself because i'm you know into this stuff of spiritual things and he can't stop himself from talking about it kind of thing so there, was an was an another one tonight we're just using the word or last week we're using the word just being open so in my natural state i was more open and he felt free to express those things so, that's what we're talking about so far is, are we okay so far are you finished susan yes it's safe yeah that covers you yeah thank you somebody from last week from last week talked about more space [Applause] and we're trying in the more space to see if the self that's there could, make itself known somehow or each other okay, see in a tight space we're so bobby and robert whatever your names are okay so one by two by uh it's kind of thick and there's a self there but it's kind of enshrouded okay so hartford to make itself known at first, to hear its voice at first so as you get more room more room we're hoping that would facilitate the self, showing itself expressing itself uh kind of letting you know i don't mean no uh somehow uh somehow manifesting its presence in some form or another, anybody on that self-self self from last week because i know you've been sitting with this all week i would just want to hear what you were sitting with that was kind of a dick by the way but i'll be nice and anybody along those lines steve justin i'll jump in again hey justin again uh connecting with space i want to pick up on something else i've noticed that you mentioned last week that the, different brains out layout that you mentioned a thinking brain feeling brain feeling sensing uh, it with a sense of more space it, seems much easier to, settle quickly past the thinking feeling brains and get into a zone where self can reveal itself um when i'm not you know occupying my space with other yeah fun and tighter thicker yeah, what was your sense of self you, mentioned it what was your was your earlier there's a radiant of some degree core available um, without an agenda per se it might when i'm, working with one of the within a character they have feelings and thoughts and agendas so to speak but the self doesn't quite have feelings like that or an agenda per se it's just um available present yeah okay and with a little practice you can tell the difference between uh help me out here uh here uh between the uh aliveness of a physical body, you know you do your exercise and your body's more alive and you're humming a little bit better that's nice good, good but that's not self because your body is humming a little bit after a good tense game uh that's nice yes, yes but we're talking about that the hum make up a word of self you called it glow uh radiation uh it has its own help has its own i like radiance or you've said aliveness it's a, persistent vitality that's not like charged, per se like the characters would have their juice it's more even flow steady uh not worked up so much so to say i believe uh you use the word vitality i believe right here oh sensei loves the word vitality inferring this, self at a very good level there's some vitality, vital force he calls it so he likes the word vital also in this uh terrain of self much finer than body character thing bob mentioned something last week like a the self self-generating power it generates the power of itself from itself, yeah so to speak so i, like that yeah in yeah in uh dialoguing with cells uh i find some aren't aware of their which we call it their aliveness they're hovering around themselves uh but they're still not aware that, that in what the hell are the words sometimes the words get strange people are difficult, in pulsing with itself it comes more alive itself okay, all right all right now you have to find out in your case uh what kind of quote pulsation seems to work the self the self in becoming a finer self what, form might work for you okay but i usually suggest at this stage of the game to themselves i'm dealing with uh some kind of uh beat okay beat okay right uh is tom on tonight no sensei okay because he brought up i think last week something about breathing it's like yeah but we have to be careful because the person character you know bobby breed not ovaries sensei breeds whatever, uh yeah maybe he was on target but i wanted to make sure as i said let's not for there uh let's make sure it's self's what pulsation self re-energization of itself okay, uh just so we don't get confused see everything overlays so it's easy to get kind of confused okay it's not like something's way over there and something else is way over there like everything overlays okay so there's a bobby here and an idea about things and then easy there's a self in here also but see they're overlaid so uh self you, do you mean me who feels myself is that the self we're talking about like no but i can see the confusions if you're in this heavy state and we're talking about something here the heavy state may be hard pressed to sense, the inner finer level of things and so it's easy to get confused sometimes you might think i'm on you a bit too much about the wording of things i, just don't want to facilitate more confusion okay or we can throw out a fancy word you know the original god radiating love oh yes i, like the idea i've got it i've got it it's like no you ain't got it you got this idea but it's not here in the original where it's actually happening here that's a potential for all of us okay get to the source of sensei might say the source is here but we've got a lot of confusions between bobby and that level of here so i'm sort of against throwing out fancy words to the folks who in their heavy levels uh say oh yeah i understand the word i got it i'm sorry you ain't got i'm sorry ain't that except a nice idea okay that's right experience what do you experience, what do you experience is very important just the idea awareness tricky, tricky it'll spin you off anyway there's enough on that ah, sensei i remember when you first at least in my recollection this distinction began to show up people would come to you after an aikido class and talk about how well they felt and how good the class was and everything and what you picked up on and mentioned it to us at the time was they're talking about the kind of thing you get from the good tennis game or whatever you were talking about that aikido should produce something more than that which we didn't call it the self then but that's what you were talking about yeah or at least something inner finer right yeah uh because i recognize because being a an athlete so to speak i recognize the words they were using as being exercise words, you know you know but i was hoping for inner, wording of things and all i was hearing was these uh jock word physical words it's like yeah, that's cool better nothing but, this is aikido if you want to be a junk run around the block it's probably better for you no one bend your wrists yeah thank you for reminding me about that i that i kind of remember that very clearly it really struck me oh i think we missed something here kind of thing okay anything before we move on to tonight's subject okay we've used the word easy before we've touched on it before but i thought it was quite a while back and of course you've been developing along the way i thought to try that word again, okay, easy, easy, now let's see as best as you can you see okay now let me think about the word easy what does that mean okay don't go there don't go there so what should i say here easy as a feeling easy eventually as a sensing of easy okay, now as we easy there might be a something experienced in that easiness and because there's something experienced to be oh let me think about that let me solidify that let me package that it's like no let's not go there you might take a quick, momentary note, but let's continue with easy, easy, okay sort of the sense there are multi-multi dimensions of easier levels of easy okay it's not just one word once it's a sort of a continuation i can't think of a better way of saying it, so everybody ah, easy, easy i wonder uh let me screw you over here a moment uh moment uh even in those first very early stages of easy, you probably noted some uh i don't know physical changes yeah you give me a couple of fast ones just fast and quick what, changes did you notice let's say in the body or, or breathing slower breathing slowed okay easy breathing slow okay now there, when the breathing slows oh breathing is slowing oh yeah breathing okay so this is pretty typical i'd like you all to be kind of well versed in there's an experience and then there's, an experience and then there's this i don't even know what to call it an unnatural natural thing to an idea mental about it that that's seems so common that i call it unnatural natural all right and i don't want to do that i don't want to hang out here and package breathing okay so noted quickly big enough and with my feet kind of softened into the into the surface i'm standing on oh wow melting let's see is there anything written spiritually about melting you see don't go there it's a quick, notice and continue easy, am i saying this right okay, i think it's a very important trick of the trade because i think people have a an experience and then they stop the continuing experience which is critical damn important the way to go and they start formulating things okay so it'd be nice if you're well versed in that, what you call a trick and let's continue ah, easy, easy one more let me jump in again sorry um, are you noticing any of the other words we use for example clearing or, letting go letting go or a little more space there anyone have those words or sense jump in as they're just easy i have a subtle opening subtle and open okay so there might be well we'll pick that up at the end of the session gee being easy is like being settled being easy is like letting go any, anybody else with any catch there uh sensei there's a spaciousness about the body itself and so spaciousness yes or space okay yeah i didn't want to double up on it like spacious and body is in the spacious i didn't want to double up on it could i say uh, that's fine i, just i'm just happy with oh more space don't know if i said that well sensei i don't know if this goes the direction you're headed but one of the first things that drops away drops away is the mental activity about you know today's whatever's happening that's the first thing that i let go of and that, leads to these other feelings yeah now if you're starting here fine it's a starting place okay and as you start easy it should click, click or hopefully it will click, click or hopefully it will click, click yes yeah, so that's your first clue that you're on the right track, because it didn't get busier thinking about, uh, uh, uh, easy what, is easy what's easy in japanese and, going around and around on it you moved out of that area okay tells you you're on the right track that's all doesn't say you're perfect yet but you're on track but stay on track and let's continue easy, easy yes [Music] uh okay yeah stop yeah stop sort of don't want to but i think some important points when you stop and chit chat and mulan stuff like i'm doing we're doing right now, and you go back to easy i don't try to necessarily start where i finished, i start wherever easy is, at the level it's at okay, and it's at a lesser level than i finished that's okay i just continue easy and then within a couple or so oh i'm at that same level of eez that i was, when i finished the last series and i continue okay uh so i think some people can screw things up by uh hitting a good level but the baby falls out of the crib or whatever you got to get up and do something, and then you get back to sitting you can't necessarily hit it right at that first moment where you lift it and that's okay don't get pissed at the baby falling out of the crib or whatever just hit it again and it's there and because you've been there just a short time ago it should be fairly easy to get back there soon but don't, panic or, add extra air in, there is that okay what i said did you clear okay, all right all right in my case my easy is getting extra little softness then i'm uh i wanted to mull on that for a bit it got like almost where it's hard to say easy it's easier to say [Music] i'm also whispering for example of that easy the word easiness, is also trying to play in air sure, easy, easy-ness and instead of trying to figure it out right now it'll be something i file away and when i'm sitting out there in my important forks chair uh i might play with it any difference or any, improvement instead of easy after a bit it's easiness does anything change there per se whatever and i fine-tune it i don't have to do it now, i'd like to move along with just a basic easy, easy gonna have to jump in if your attention is still focusing and feeling the body to see if it's being affected by the easy you might be hanging on too tight so what am i saying should be a certain level of sensing easy as opposed to feeling, so we had feelings before you all probably noticed on the first couple of easies when we started the body adjusted somehow or tell you, could feel things the breathing change the settling change, uh, a different vibration rate with the feet and the floor sort of a melting into kind of thing uh yeah but as you continue don't keep your eyes focused on the body level uh because we move into finer and you won't be able to i don't know the words experience the finer of it if you're focusing on the heavier okay, if you focus heavily on bobby you're going to be hard-pressed to be a robert kind of pattern okay all right so easy with an innate sense that this is a finer, vibrational dimension of easy okay let's take a pause on that uh series that series anything going on i don't know might confuse you or scare you or to be able to hang out here and continue any anything i may have missed and we're going to jump in on that in your easy is there anything occurring that might become an obstruction or scare you or confuse you or anything happening in your easy uh sensei bob here hey i went through a, dark space which i was i was comfortable enough with the dark after all these years that it didn't scare me but i could see if i wasn't familiar with, what the darth indicated that it could i could say wait a minute i don't want to go kind of like the doctor in his first experience of the dark in the book so that didn't happen but i can readily see how it could [Music] yeah, yeah so see through how to paraphrase that let me try this uh, you run into dark and you don't know what dark is so bob is right, there you get wow what's going on it's all getting dark uh easy with the dark so my first approach on dart was there's something going on but i can't see it or be aware of it and more importantly now, experience it so i have to be easy through the dark i'll get to a certain level where it sort of lights up again and i'll be at a different level and then i'll be aware experiencing that level and who i am at that level, and who i am at that level like if you're using characters who's the character at this level okay we have to come around on dark sometime, soon, again it's very it's a big time piece i would like to make sure you have a good sense of it okay anybody else anything you bumped into that may block you out scare you away or whatever okay i'll tell you mine reached a point there where how to say it, there's a moment there a short period of time in there where uh, for lack of work i was losing myself it was like disappearing or something and, i don't know if anyone wants to really disappear, disappear okay uh but i bumped into that now that something like that might scare people away no wait i got to be somebody because if i nobody disappearing that's scary for a lot of people okay so what should we do with something like that one thing is we could say okay i i'm reaching something really totally new i want to get a little clearer on things so at this level of easy their energy still movements whatever now i really not focus not focus on them but let them sort of come into play at this level energies are mixing up me character, who am i at this level and i'd be experiencing myself then i'd naturally be more aware of myself and my viewpoint of things my philosophy if you would okay so if you get uh if you're getting a little leery about getting lost you can sort of call it there and, establish at that level the character you at that level and the experience important of the character you at that level and that might facilitate uh then later being able to move on even more finer continually is that almost clear yeah since you had given me similar advice once about uh squaring away getting a sense of the, lay of the land, at a certain level before moving on so we don't jump too far ahead okay or jump in maybe just dip our toe in it and get a sense of flex for a moment there but get lay of the land is how you described it and be the citizen of that land indeed exactly yes okay and then you can move along any, time but to hang out there and experience yourself at that level and then be prepared to let that go and continue to move on using whatever form of moving on you're using tonight's case we're using easy, yeah, that, it just anybody how, are we doing here you see is rory on roy, he's here tonight yes sensei roy, yeah here i am sensei how are you doing with, easy well what i noticed was that any uh any kind of attachments that i had loosened so that it was really uh you know kind of moving into like the spatial realm of uh of the experience rather than you know i'm still this guy or that guy or i've got this thing going on or i see this in the room or you know the whole attachment to all that seemed to be okay, and he just brought up what i tried to bring up maybe not saying it great but in his easy was letting go and that's what i asked you about earlier i said as we're just doing easy are any other things happening that sort of recognize g that's kind of like more space gee that's kind of like letting go gee that's kind of like clearing gee that's kind of like going deeper through the dark is that's right uh so uh so we could say probably all these are very similar, okay, and they and they head in the same direction meaning inner finer potentiality and i think we've said before uh find one that you like that's comfortable for you okay and advice of sensei gave me i'll pass on to you was try some of the others because sometimes one thing is good but you get a certain maybe a slant that's a little too heavy on it i try some of the others you get a little different angle on, it you know let's say ah is a magic sound for you ah or hey just to just to see if there's a little different angle slant, okay, so anyway that's what i was going when i asked that question about is this seems familiar like anything else and roy just threw it out oh this is like letting go thank you roy okay steve yes sir yes sir and you sir easy where are you getting to what's happening here easy uh well what you do actually what you just said it just uh open uh become clear um one of the things i was noticing along the way is there's this notator, this one that experiences and then there's a, mental note, and, okay, and let it go but, those notes tend to show up you know from, time to time yeah you're talking about this one when you have an experience is how i'm presenting it and then suddenly you're getting involved with oh yeah and then like and oh yeah that thing right, yeah but it's quickly noticing that and it's oh okay let it go like the breeze yeah um yeah i think becomes clearer it becomes more open settled you know one of the things that you mentioned before when you were talking to susan uh and, your experience at the barber shop i noticed that when i do clear and open you know say in an encounter with another person there is a, tendency to want to have to have an agenda to fix that person or feedback that person and when i find that i easy let go open it, gives them the space to get what they need um, you used to do a thing long time ago where you would have partners and we would clear and the partner could reach in and take what they needed you know because you're playing no game yeah, that kind of thing so, yeah, yeah and then i, built a whole thing around it you got a girlfriend and she leaves you and you're like oh you know you don't leave me or why don't you leave me and, you're distraught and i see poor guys sometimes this drop for up to a year i thought this is sad this is dumb what's going on here that in associating with another person you're sort of borrowing qualities from them because they have i don't know more obvious or whatever and you borrow them okay, now if they lose a leave before you've gotten you've taken enough from them the window's been slammed shut so to speak, okay or you've taken 10 pounds whatever she's taken from you 10 pounds you're both sort of happy and you both agree it's time to move on a good day all right no problem nice knowing you stay in touch if you can thank you bye kind of thing okay but often one it has not gotten a full feel from them it sounds like a vampire or something here okay uh, my example my example classic i've ever mentioned this on tv on zoom young lady left and, it's like the next day i was buying flowers, i don't buy flowers not then okay and i fill the house with flowers till one of my uh roommate students whatever, uh consigliere at the time i guess uh said to me why are you filling the house with flowers i said oh yeah i am doing that aren't i well this lady who had left was very colorful that's what i said so when she left i needed to duplicate replicate her color, her youthful aliveness color i filled the house with flowers all day all day all right then i began to work on this a bit, and said uh to folks uh look at whatever quality you were borrowing from them you liked it that's why you're hanging out with them whatever and needed them but, deep inside yourself i would say now you have that color yourself if you sit and open it's there for you because you have something that's dissimilar to that, you yourself okay, is that did i say that right did you catch that yeah and in doing that uh the pain of them leaving, uh was uh was shortened oh there'd be moments where it come back but it would be the same thing okay about her easy, and you could pick it up real fast uh but these uh but the, type of guys that would be uh for a year for god's sake i called them pasty white because they would look kind of white because whatever they're taking and it left and then they get pasty i thought that that's how i used to call those guys the pasty white guys learn that you have it within your own that's why you are attracted to them okay and you have your version of it within yourself okay and if you're not soaking yours up you'll start to miss them again and uh there's your clue you're not absorbing that that's within you it's time now how do you know you're starting to do that okay some people think i'm not into emotionality i'm into the truth where that came from i'm not into stop i'm sorry you guys can go do that i'm not going to do that you do that oh but look it means i care it means you're boxed in and you're an idiot i'm sorry we better move along in topics here where the hell are we where are we sensei this is uh lauren i'd like to ask a question if i could yes sir um you know we've spent uh this evening easy easier and easier and you know you know as always you've emphasized the benefits of, easing into it and then several cycles to deepen the experience when i uh you often use easy as part of the phrase easy the eye and when you what is the i in that in this case what, identity, identity i'm bobby and here's my problems and here's my bobby easy, bobby you're hanging on to bobbiness, but this is my reality easy, and hopefully he's doing what we're doing easy that there's a little more space there that there's little settling going on in there that there's a letting go of bobby's order that is a type of letting go yeah so easy the eye is basically what we're doing now easy i just started it maybe heavier with easy the eye take that component and play with easy, easy, easy okay tonight we didn't start with easy the eye, uh i was uh i was hoping a little more advanced and we could just start with you're out of that level, you're this level or this level and now let's easy, basically the same thing i think i think i said it right thank you see the sense of ongoingness uh, people should kind of know it's, ongoing for quite a while okay uh so when you easy the eye that and you get to the next level there's no more room and there's still an i its name may change oh this is me or something whatever, uh, oh there i feel better because i'm not bitching, about what bobby was bitching about that doesn't sort of exist here oh good i've, arrived this is samadhi or some nonsense no you've moved good for you good tells you you're on lineage you learn a lot of tricks of the trade if you're alert i don't know if that's a good word now let's continue as soon as possible let's continue why stop now let's continue okay so there's a bit of a journey here what do we call process sometimes a lot of words we could use okay follow the pattern follow the process uh, train, inner training yeah so, at any level you get to and it's neat whatever neat is for you at that stage uh tj you're telling me a lot of your meditators uh, seem to stop short uh when they reach their calmness peacefulness gonna jump in here yeah, where are we going um well it stopped there it's a natural place to start to stop because it seems like that's the goal yeah starts like well i'm anxious i'm angry i'm upset i'm confused, uh and if i hit a level in meditation it's a good thing to arrive at calm and you then what you may think is well that's it that's what meditation is about and you stop there and it's just like the, tip of the iceberg yeah it's opening you just as you've said you know with easy you're talking about the opening and settling and easy is the way to, drop into that field that dimension of, of greater perhaps insight that is directly related to experience yeah so it's important to arrive at calm that's a good thing but when they stop yes and say i've arrived yeah, that's, where i'm sorry tj we have to get a little on him somehow we got to move them along it depends uh if i'm on my if in, my zen context or in my vipassana context so thing is a little more rigorous and i'm pushing them off the cushion you know not literally but uh you know with vipassana it's just an encouragement to go to go deeper to or to explain to them that this is quite likely going to happen they might not reach calmness it may reach peacefulness they may reach easiness but sort of all the same real close in there, but they're going to read something like that if they're doing a proper earlier meditation form yeah and just to give them a heads up before this oh yeah well that's very good hang out there for a bit enjoy the hell out of it out of it i love what you're saying sensei but the thing is the thing is about explaining things we do that in dharma talks and so on, uh it's great and it really kind of just goes on top of your head until you have the experience, it has to have you have to have the experience of, that actual moving deeper, or a kind of saturation you've soaked in calmness what if you have a class a little more advanced people it was a little bit little bit uh and you expect they can all get to a calm quiet whatever place and when they do they just raise their index finger to say okay i'm in that zone and we see a lot of fingers you say okay now, we're going to proceed yeah and you continue through that it teaches the tricks of the trade of continuing, yeah, yeah that's not bad i i've, used that with uh with teenagers that i've taught you know so actually the, finger, but i gave you the finger wow that's a good thing you know the right the correct finger but yes, yeah that can work you know when you're working with meditation to have to have an indicator if especially if you're working with a teacher or a guide yeah, you wait, for that moment and uh yeah that's, not that's a good skill actually that's a useful one yeah and some people probably uh it's a variety of levels could i say of, self of, self uh and some people hit a certain level like calm peaceful whatever quiet whatever, and, that's great guns to them and if you say now i can teach you how to move on past this to the even more finer uh, they won't want to go i know in some form tell you leave me alone i'm happy here i call that level of comfortableness in the old days they reach their level of comfortableness and stay ready for next and they go no get out of here i'm fine i'm fine and that's the human condition along the way as you go finer and finer, more developed people are dropping off if you spent your whole life in anxiety and you finally get a taste of some uh some calm yes don't bug me i'm fantastic yes, yes yeah and then you can encourage you can encourage that but it there's a certain self motivation i think there's a certain, self, the calling you have to keep calling to go beyond yeah and some people don't have more of a calling to their self i don't know how to word it their self is not as developed so even in certain ways i don't know their grammar school selves others are high school selves others are college selves okay yeah it's good to recognize levels of development yeah that's, right you know yeah for sure anybody that's been a teacher uh especially of kids and you know you, you see the levels of development you know it's very easy to track it's a little more difficult to recognize emotional and uh mental maturity in, adults if you will it's kind of common that many of you are aikido you might uh teach a class but you advertise it as a sort of advanced class, meaning you want to work at that level plus you don't want a white belt or uh or somebody okay uh so this is not unusual yeah, it's very calm it's common in fact, it's not unusual at all i think we're presenting it to you so that you with the sense that hell you've been hanging out with me here, for a couple of years or more uh, probably have a better sense of the continuation of self so just be careful of certain things that naturally happen they could even slow you down or stop you uh by knowing how they shh lesser people i don't mean that uh how they stop and why they stop they stop and why they stop could help you who don't really want to stop, recognize it and continue yeah, we, sort of don't know how to say it any better but close enough for fact that's a good that's a good way that's a good a good that's a good way that's a good way of saying it's a it's an easy way to, say to recognize you know to recognize without in a way without judgment you know, we've been there if you if you haven't been there you may be there you may it might be your future you know so it's a good it's a good way to uh to be in relationship around transformational things when you're recognizing dimensionality you're, recognizing the process and the, great value of, one of the many great values of your teaching is that you have laid out both what you call travel vehicles and the process and understanding dimensionality understanding easy the eye is not just a fancy saying that you know okay i've got easy the eye now what else but that's we're always visiting and revisiting this as a as a deepening and continuing again i'm sort of a mapper one of my main things uh and so i like to map out the steps map out the process hoping that people can utilize to get something out of that, their journey can be a bit easier remember a lot of these things they weren't talk to me i was a self-learner where [Music], i jumped into meditation well i took a few lessons from you know a couple of sessions uh whatever uh from a fellow because i knew i needed some basic so i learned how to sit there for an hour on my legs yeah or however we were sitting in those days uh and get through that and then but, my development was me and me i didn't have really a clear road sign i didn't have a guru teaching me along the way [Music], not really it but you have within you the ability of moving along i'm just trying to facilitate it a bit give you a general sense of things uh, [Music] where you can follow that track now i want to stipulate here follow that track but also be ready to use your own words okay, so again uh we were doing easy and roy said oh letting go and somebody else said oh more room you know find the sense of it that is more comfortable for you and the character that gets mixed along the way at different levels is you, can't mix up a nado i can't mix up oh sensei okay he warned me about that a couple of times you know uh i gotta do me and you gotta do you but i follow a certain all right and then my quality and their qualities my character in there that's, the nado line did i say anything intelligent with all of that yeah okay ah so let's talk about easy uh again it'd be nice if you did some homework easy is nice because it's uh it's settling it's relaxing it's whatever, so i expect you to spend a little time next week in fact do we have a next week off wow you've got two weeks to play i expect you to play a little bit okay, anything on easy, yeah sensei i'd like to jump in and elaborate a bit more on, this element of your process as you've mapped it out that the, evidence we get through our experience is very reliable consistent, sustainable easy today will be similar tomorrow and the next day you know it's a very consistent experience that we move ourselves through and that's as a reference point reassuring, i would say predictable in a way but we know what to expect as we continue on to finer and finer yeah so it helps us to be consistent yeah and i like that so thank you uh see something in here we should bring out uh, [Music] san jose on tonight not jack the other samsung andrew there he is andrew i'm here a little bit related, okay i thought last week was it you said if i remember something like okay we're in a, three by three kind of thing and you brought up a question problem right there you remember not really not really and i said to you uh well look at one to two has been good two to three has been good why do you think the next it's not going to be good or better now i remember yes okay uh one possibility there is in not clearing the starting place yeah let's say your starting head is, negative, and critical let's say okay fine no problem you got to start someplace i start as an sometimes, because that's what i am i could have been somebody but anyway uh different movie, uh, but you can't retain that one and move into two by three by four by because that one is carrying his, negative uh, baggage, uh yeah uh nate what i used to work critiquer, no matter how what beautiful thing happens that one's there's like no, okay that one has to be cleared as best as you can from the get-go you can't carry him into this work he'll destroy it i, had my experience with that i can't remember now uh i was in a nice meditative space and suddenly there was a negator going on yeah, bitching and moaning about it i thought what the hell is that i'm in this nice space i recognize the space well it's all that's negative and i have to really go back on that and see what he'll happen and i hadn't cleared maybe that first easy the eye easy the bobby easy the worrier not the warrior the worrier okay easy, really honestly easy so i can continue properly because if i try to carry that one into this it can't happen you're carrying like a cancer into a beautiful system but you don't have to carry the cancer you can take a couple extra moments up front and clear the cancer easing the eye in whatever form you want to do that so i think that should give you a better sense of what to do my, idea of what maybe you should do you play with it and see if that does anything for you okay something else good you know okay uh, so next week off huh for those of you who contributed to the book and haven't heard anything uh it's still being worked on and somehow or other they will notify you eventually not to panic all's well moving along uh it apparently will get published haven't decided quite a lot but uh but uh it's gonna happen but give it time these things take time so those of you who are saying i haven't been notified it's okay you'll be notified eventually it's all right uh anything, anything on easy, it's making you sensei um which, new zealander is that mark knight it's mock go for it i really like the, just the, word easy because the um, it's, it's a nice word that kind of feels safe and in a way every time i easy, um, my experience gets deeper uh whereas if i if i was sort of either letting go or, even with kind of trying, to experience something easy it's just like ch chill out and, see what happens yeah and could i say again right there uh easy is a better word for him for somebody else letting go may be easier but i started i think i wanted you to see the similarities of the many words that we use choose yours and do now and then try some of the others just to get a different flavor go ahead you weren't finished, uh yeah so uh yeah so i've lost track now but um yeah just, the just the, uh the fact that as that word easy just helps to deepen the experience the, i actually start to experience rather than try to experience, rather than try to experience i guess sometimes there's this idea i'll go experience but that doesn't work i've got a just easy, easy and, from there from there something starts to happen yeah the next, grouping of you if there's enough space any time you can say okay enough and what's the grouping and the grouping center circle energies mixing up a character you experience you'll be aware but experience first good trick uh so where am i going all of these potentially are, the same in that easy, and if you want to leave as somebody you at the end you can't go any further with easy your time is running out whatever you say okay here and then you naturally let it all configure into the character you at that level then you can get up and go 10 sheep or whatever it is you do [Laughter] okay yeah it's kind of important there because you don't want to have a do all this work have a good sitting whatever, whatever, and finish and go back to bobby kind of thing, you really want to uh stand and move around and go take care of the sheep as this level character you that you we need to practice okay if i've been bobby for a long time need a little practice and robert being robber and moving as robert thinking as robert and lifting his robert, socializing is robert a new practice time there oh with yourself as yourself at that level that's, cool yeah people were approaching the end here so again next week off uh, it would be nice if you were to spend a little time on your own uh this thing should be pleasant for you especially something like this easy whatever, okay, [Music] again in a in a certain size space now we not focus but okay now we're changing our focus, changing our attention or changing, our attention or changing something okay now the energies in this space mixing up and there are qualities there energies finer our qualities they mix up the character you now inside underneath that, is self is self see so again now overlay so the space all this activity the character that gets mixed the self is, underlying that it's there, okay so the better the space the better the character the more balanced the character better way of saying it saying it the better the self can show that it's there, okay was that almost clear enough it's a basic i have to come back around and make sure you really have that overlay sense but sense but again while sensitive don't go anywhere it's here but you have to understand the inner finer dimensional and the overlay factor doing that yeah huh finishing up finishing up anybody anything yeah and as so as you and mark were talking about keeping it sustainable it's not enough to access that state of being and then go do something and it's awesome you know you know i see this with a lot of yoga people they're in class and at the end of class they're very peaceful and then they get into traffic and it all goes out the window like what are they doing for 90 minutes and it's just it doesn't seem to be sustainable um a lot of it also is the awareness, of nice stuff nice stuff but the awareness is uh it's easy to push over okay, i used to be famous as being a balloon popper their awareness being a balloon wouldn't take much to pop it but if they're having the experience at that level equal to their awareness now not forever but they're like a strong tree in a heavy wind they can sustain for quite a while it's, being experienced and not even your physical body i did that but it's here there's a body here a presence here uh yeah and if you don't catch that then you're going to end up like he's trying to say about the people that oh damn oh i'm so oh i'm so nice and caring and then boom they're in the traffic that's it at the end of it something was missed tj you brought up the same thing uh, with people that you deal with indeed i did i think told me a cute one where they get into uh the peaceful quiet and then they get irk when some noise is going on off stop making that noise you're disturbing my quiet and you pointed out right from the beginning that when you're doing good meditation there's nothing that can really disturb your meditation because everything is part of your meditation the, dishes crash in the sink because the cat jumped up there and you have that moment so, so what then you just come back to where to what is happening in that moment and um i think that's a that's a skillful means that's a skillful way of engaging with practice of the open settle with easy, you know it's not easy on the conditions that everything is perfectly quiet and still right it's an important piece people running out of time thank you for hanging out enjoy uh next weekend and i'll see you the weekend after okay take care thank you thank you thank you thank you bob thank you everyone thank you thank you thank you sensei good night good night all uh lauren yes sir i'm just wondering since uh bob mentioned the book uh, is there still time to send in pictures or is that too late no, pictures you can send them send them to me and or, you can use that uh submissions uh address i, i don't recall where it is do you why don't you just send, them um, send them to me at uh, l-a-u-r-i-n [Music], n i l-a-u-r-i-n-i-n dot h e r, gmail.com, okay yeah i may have some that i can i can i have to probably scan them or use an app but i have some pictures with bob that, might be fun to send and you use them or not well that'd be great do you know roughly from when oh, i would say it could be uh 10 years ago one of them with it's one with, uh me and my wife and, um, bob and katya uh-huh i also i think i have a picture of bob with his new uh, jaguar i don't know okay well uh sure uh send them along to me that'd be great yeah you take them or not you know it's just okay we'll add it to the collection okay thanks lauren thanks a lot steve okay take care

take a cup I thought we'd take a couple minutes and uh because you had a week break or more uh any questions experiences anything with this sense of uh, thinking feeling fine or feeling sensing and then finer sensing any, uh observations experiences anything on, that before we go into tonight's subject that was a question hello out there hi sensei [Music] Ken it's Ken Kenny yeah, hey Kenny hey, um the sensing it's hard to talk about it without saying the word feeling but you know when I'm sensing I feel here I feel that I am here now the thinking is the very abstract even if I think I'm thinking about math yeah that's why it was drawn this way Kenny I didn't take sensing and put it over there someplace or up there someplace it's here I'm sorry go, ahead you weren't finished I uh just as much as it I'll be it's, surprising to me how effective it is as a practice it's very simple and very effective is that a compliment to my work can it absolutely, compliment to the intelligence of creation uh enabling us to figure this out and experience this yes oh boy thanks Kenny anybody anything on uh your great insights experience with uh um while I was kind of following on from what Kenny was saying I certainly always felt that the word feeling included sensing um until recently and your uh very definite approach to having them as two separate things or things that move on one from the other and for me what came out of that was that feeling is, within me and sensing is my connection to what's outside of me it's made sense to me right could we also say that in sensing there's like sense feeling not a heavy physical feeling but something akin to feeling, but something akin to feeling when you're sensing you feel things oh yes, it's, although there may not be a tangible aspect to it in terms of touching yes it is but it is my experience of the outside world rather than Within Me so that feeling is very much I feel I feel what's happening within me I sense what's happening around me around me that's just that's what's kind of made more sense to me yeah I, would just myself not present it that way because people use feeling as a heavy word and not feel a little finer and then say okay now I'm sensing in the outer world uh as sensing has a type of feeling let's say that subtle feeling not a tangible feeling but a subtle feeling and in that world of sensing the world is sensed at finer levels are we screwing up too many words here well as you all said previously it is the problem are the words yes no I'm completely on, track with what you're saying okay then we're okay yeah Bob you know I I'm a sub when we talk about sensing I, would not want to talk about sensing having so much to do with the outer world as the inner world, as the inner world it's my sense of sensing is a more internal experience yeah could we say it this way yes it's internal you get to a level of sensing internally and because of that you're sensing from that level things around you at that level yeah I, guess I'm just cautious about using the word world tends to make us think about the uh the uh the Manifest world well that's where we are that's where we are still you know and we're just at a finer level when we talk about sensing we're in the Manifest world but very fine when sensing comes into play okay I'm in the physical world when I'm playing with an energy body right it's a finer energy vibration than the physical body but I'm still in the Manifest world I'm just at a better level anymore yeah no I shouldn't have used manifest but, my sense is it's still a more interior kind of experience is, what uh well yeah I think we need to have that first yeah then right if you have an inner sensing then this is a, program for a week or two from now I'm going to play with that the senses, right the sin says uh so for example uh inner world of sensing and then if your dog is sitting in front of you some people have an affinity for that lineage and they'll sense the dog's Expressions you can talk dog that that's how I used to talk to dogs it was and just but that's a different for a different weekend for a different Friday so pass on that for now I'm going to cover that clearly when I do a Friday night on it anybody anything is it time to move on Brad what's your account quiet tonight why is it quiet tonight we got a major here okay, ah, okay manifest hidden divine uh also another word we introduced to you with the hidden uh was uh domain okay, um when I first approach it I thought hidden were the finer Energy's Dimensions they were getting kind of fine with the heavy people couldn't quite catch it and when I first thought that was probably hidden they're there but because people are kind of too heavy they're too bobbi-ish or too one in a one by a one by they can't pick it up because it's in the three by or four by or something uh, it's more than that it's more than in the Manifest uh it's that well I'm not getting ahead of myself, uh anyway I just want to say when we say hidden we're also saying uh, the domain word domain hidden, domain, word domain hidden, domain oh okay is that is that all right uh where should we go here where should we go here uh this Crosshair thing that's here is purposeful, uh it's sort of hopefully infers in the Manifest the green picture in the Manifest and the dimensionality that are there the heavier to finer the Bobby Robert not though the one by two by three by the chair and now uh that were and I call it squaring away another thing, be in the Here and Now sort of squared away ah kind of thing okay uh so that there's a bit of sense of that squared awareness or that uh, addition sign thing uh you need a quite a bit of that to properly move into the next light blue here is the uh, The Hidden okay uh the domain realm and you need to be squared away there at that level to some degree a good degree to potentially move into the heavenlies, the heavenlies are very fine very original, and we're getting past everybody's pay grade here but uh my job is to map my job is to point the finger to the Moon if you would so that's what I'm doing I'm pointing the finger uh oh, boy now one of my fears is in talking about fancy stuff like Divine is people get a scent of it a picture of it an idea about it I understand it I believe it I'm there that scares the hell out of me okay it's critical to have experience into finer experience into eventually hidden experience if you can get this far into the heavenlies okay so you need that experience also it's not just conceptual idea map belief we need that experience okay critical, critical, so when you hear me jump on some people it's probably in that area you're talking about it yeah that's cool we should talk about it uh we should have a picture of it potentially we should have some ideas yes information yes, yes, yes, and that's not the totality of it and you're going to get screwed up if you continue with that it's gonna like spin you out of the fine you try to get to finer and it'll like spin you out is the best way I pick it up uh back to a uh, something before it so uh the fullness that's again what the crosshairs are there to represent the fullness the fullness, the fullness okay one of all sensei's presentations of trying to get people Fuller was deeper Roots deeper roots deeper roots and when we get into uh, going over more clearly the uh down time the trade in uh debt is very important depth of experience, okay not just an awareness about depths of experience am I bouncing all around the place here tonight I hope not uh, so in the green manifest all of our Basics settling [Applause], getting some Harmony Left Right female male whatever form you're using whatever little variations of words you use okay underforce is going up upper Forge is going down male female okay right fire water oh sensei okay Izanagi is a Nami okay so uh whatever words that are comfortable for you are fine, okay now in the green in the Manifest we get a certain amount of development okay ah and that's uh Bobby to Robert not those an example moving from a one by one set to a 4x4 set that's development now soon let's say around there you have the potential to have a sense of, of how it works in the manifested dimensionality of things um [Music], some sense of aware experience experiencing aware uh you have some, sense and some experience with that someplace in there you're kind of lining up and there'll be a potential to move into this next oh what to call it move into the hidden move into the uh domain, okay now very important uh where I'm going to skip to manifest because I've been playing in there for quite a while I know all about it so I'm going to skip that I'm going for the domain lady will say I'm going to skip all of this I'm going for the heavy leagues and you won't line up you won't experience the things you have to experience on this journey, okay so, these and I, don't mean to keep you in every day you start with a very tight half by half and then you move into one by one and then uh you know after a while you get better at it and you wake up and you're like hey and boom you're, you're like hey and boom you're, right there you're at a three by three on a good day okay uh we laid those out so you can see how it works where a one by one comes in how to recognize a what body wants okay how to move from a one by two by how to how to move from a one by two by how to move from a Bobby to a robber to another ah but once you have the, experiential sense of that easy settle right about there probably a good clue is the self sensing some sense of self sensing that's probably a good clue I would say that uh okay a fair amount or a certain amount of sensing Clues you in that you don't have to continue with left right uh a Mr Nado oh the great Sensei another Superior Grade Center and on and on and on with the developmental form of the Manifest it goes on and on and on so you have to go on and on and on sure forever is going to be forever it's not okay essentially in many ways probably potentially very fast potentially very uh trying to trying to in a certain way explain the Simplicity of this overlaid diagram that here you are square away this next world what we call Hidden but he called it in what I call domain have to hang out there a bit okay the not the rules are changing I don't have the good words yet but, you're not in the uh back and forth developmental thing when you make that shift it's, it's a bit different okay it's not just another finer dimension, okay, uh, and the hangout there in the domain in The Hidden oh since they used for me with me the uh three words it says it's like the gymnasium therefore you have some not physical body but a body sense Maybe by that time we won't use the word bodies one day we'll come around on archetypes archetype body very Advanced body okay uh but there is a so he likes gymnasium because he wants to keep this so that's a really retain that Here and Now, he called it a laboratory you need to hang out up for a little bit and play and see how things work much clearer than they did in the Manifest okay we see how some things we're going to manifest but here it's how things work at this level could we call it so a gymnasium a laboratory a library there's things to be learned experience learned experienced learned okay so he liked those three words that he told me uh so you just don't jump through it I want to get to the heavenlies uh you gotta hang there for a bit if you're in fact can get there okay how you get there make sure your basics in the green manifest your Bobby Robert and I'll do whatever style you're using okay and use a vibratory style of Harmony to get up to and self-sensing to be able to for like the words pass through into the, light blue world what if I hope I'm not losing you okay ah heavenlies so again back to life Blue World light blue World hanging out there uh and the realization the experience the realization that you're in that world uh oh since they would say the textures are a bit different than what you're used to in the Manifest, heavier finer, finer, and there are certain textures you said the textures here are a bit different my feeling there my experience with it is uh you really have to be a pretty good sensor a good sensing to sense that oh this is different than the Manifest world okay um, to not carry the rules of the Manifest which here too far have been very good very important I'm not putting them down I'm just saying in a certain way I don't have the word yet the rules change a bit sense of thing changes a bit okay all right all right so I'm not putting down the green I'm not putting down the time we spent in it or the developmental work we spent in it or since I would say very important you need some practice there okay sort of how it develops uh, then again the possibility when you reach a certain level in the green all right all right it might happen with some people say maybe you've heard stories like this before where somebody is a great surgeman or whatever he's just The Best of the Best of the Best and instead of trying to get better he says Ah what's it all about it's kind of like he's, Borg or he sees the I don't know not necessarily limitations he can get better but he's like ah like ah where he says it must be something else going on here this is his first influence of the hidden or domain territory, actually I love that story came across properly but is it ah, I'm losing myself here help where are we Mr Noah I see your picture up there help me here say something intelligent well you are describing a, an experience with a with a very great uh swordsman getting a sense that, there's more uh when you read the uh book of five rings by Musashi who I know since it was a debt enamored of but uh he said let me let me correct he also said that it's not that he was anti-musashi he was anti-ho people were depicting him and reading him that hurt him Musashi per se didn't hurt him because what people did with that I understand anyway he says in the book of five rings when he reached about 30 that exact realization began to come in that there had to be more than being the best swordsman in Japan which he probably was by that point in time and he knew there was more than that and so he spent the rest of his life trying to develop what that more was yeah you leave the playing field so to speak you enter the monastery or the zendel or whatever yeah so not, an unusual happening we're trying to map that out try to make it clearer for you uh help me here people where, am I going to lose you got ahead of myself or get lost in there say something I deferred it TJ oh well oh well Keisha yes, sir uh I think one of the important things that's so uh challenging to depict in a in a picture yeah we've done the best we could I think at the moment is uh you said you said it very well is the overlay, nature of these of these areas of the domain with the Manifest with uh evidence so-called divine right but the uh the fact that, it's not just this layer and then we're beginning the next layer the, membranes are permeable and they, um they kind of bleed uh so to speak between them yeah so if, we understand that I think that's an important understanding uh so that we're not looking for necessarily really uh definitive differences between manifest and hidden as we move into the domain as we move as we move into the domain as we move into hidden energies it's you know it's like you're at the edge of a forest and walking in and you're you can still see the meadow because that's where you're coming from but you get more deeply into it, if you don't mind my uh sorry I just don't want to get people into going through the forest and looking at the trees that's the best I could come up with at the moment yeah, the overlay see we tried to present in the Manifest many examples of overlay when I said I'm Bobby how easy I do a little something easy oh here's Robert I stand straighter okay I have a little more bounce in my legs I'm a little stronger I'm a little more confident but that's they're both Here and Now Bobby is here and Robert Is Here If You Reach in their wallet it's the same license, it's not somebody else's license so it's an overlay so we've tried to do overlay forever okay and here's just an arm yeah easy here's an arm with a bit of energy flowing through it and whoa somebody pushes it's a bit different oh it'll break but it felt different ah settle here now aware experience experiencing aware ah Fuller energy boom now we start to uh where your partners say oh my God this is a tough one potentially they're all in the same place but that's been overly Bobby's arm a little bit of energy ah arm that level of energy flow huh okay and that's all we've been trying to do for years with this overlay you know uh do the movement and you do the movement and you see you trick them a little bit sometimes you say now if you're really settled and calmered she's a great calm day for you but play that game as best as you can not the idea of the game but like play the game now do the same technique and whoa it ought to be different to the UK different to the UK different to the nage different than anybody watching same person same technique same Dojo but he's at a different level it's overlaid okay so overlay the certain way shouldn't be a big problem for you uh we've been on that forever yeah we really have yeah, um that reminds me one of the things that you used to do to demonstrate the uh the overlay in working with a technique in Aikido on the mat you'd, notice that somebody has that pretty good and you'd say okay now this is not just your okay this is your ex-wife or something like that I change the situation it changed the situation it changed the situation and the Dynamics then between the where a person may have had real fluid movement how they and then also has the potential for you to, settle in there and to understand the places where you are blocking where yes to make Corrections yes to make the important refinements and Corrections yeah but that's another that I think that's a good over a good example a example of an overlay yeah, so to speak yeah since I tried to stress that with the words that I hear and now don't go anywhere it's here and now okay but no Heaven's way over there way up there someplace right through the middle bing, bing bang, yeah okay yeah okay that wasn't that was yet another one I think I've said it before that, um this is also on the mat and we were talking about finer energies I was actually using the term the psychic plane or something like that and I asked you know how, am I going to get to uh you know a greater appreciation or connect with the, psychic plane how do I get there I said and you said it's right here yeah I mean that was back in the 80s so you were recognizing and teaching this uh at that time yeah [Music], yeah this has been around for a while exactly but I said I was a child prodigy I won't go that far I'm just kidding don't listen to me uh but I do remember as a teenager and 15 or something or 16. looking at the world and saying is this it if this is it I don't I don't give a damn I just I just I just I just couldn't see any rhyme reasons I knew something I uh was missing well it was me missing the ability to move in to finer Dimension because at that time a weird teenager okay so again the again and again the importance of in doing your process through these that uh yes your view on it yes you're uh seeing this picture or reading something you understand it better yes, and yes but there's it's I don't I call it its partner or the other half yeah The Full Experience equal to your view The Full Experience is critical and that's the crosshairs again, you just do it with awareness, awareness you can get pretty into very fine dimensions in my history uh foreign very fine but something was missing as beautiful as it was something was missing, okay so my question when I went to Japan was uh, I know it works here in my meditation beautiful finer dimensions and I knew there was a trickle down maybe I was nicer one day or could move a bit better one day or something like, that but does it does it really is it really here is basically and when I saw Jose said oh yeah look at it's really here now I gotta learn how to really be here with it what are the right words Act okay so that was my question there he was good now help me get there I'll do the best work I can but along my journey I'll pop out now and then ask you a question to help facilitate my journey okay, yeah my losing myself am I losing you a beautiful overlay really uh overlay a beautiful layout diagram potentially I don't know where I've moved to ask again it's squared away it's comfortable figure out the, the beat stick of Harmony the hay to the whole uh or the left to the right or the heat to the she whatever, form you like fine uh again uh following a one comment from osensei you all have a form that you like is comfortable for you, would say but try a couple of the others out it gives you a little different angle on them I would say okay, so let's say you're a musician or you're damn well probably gonna like vibratory kinds of things whatever you call it vibratory oh, okay we're yeah great vibrational vibratory but you might want to try a couple of the other patterns maybe the he she pattern or, something anyway so that was a suggestion from, from him time, ah I think the sensing or starting a head into sensing quite a lot lately uh we'll come back at it again and again um but can be very helpful positioning tool or a tool that you'll need if in fact you move into the light blue hidden domain world if and hanging out there and whatever, whatever, whatever ah you're pretty fancy and you move into the heavenlies uh there it is it'll be quite obvious oh it's sensei's story about the naval Captain why that's an important story for him was because it was this how to say it his um it's his first Fuller presence in the heavenlies okay oh he had hints about it little pretty flash throughs which we all get along the way a little flat through something really fancy what the hell was that and you can't duplicate it he's not sure what it was okay uh so you can get little flash throughs along the way maybe even from the green you can get flash throughs about the blue, uh, big deal uh any anyway so where's those Sensei here uh his I would say his first Fuller presence in the heavenlies okay where he got the word you don't need a boat can I think there's both ends I'll say they're using swords but volcano kill you Champion is swinging uh but you don't need it [Music] and there was this Fuller presence of self of self in the heavenlies and how it worked at that level that wowed him okay, so that's why the story is important to him it was his first Fuller Presence at that level where the hell are we hello out there in the world go ahead you go this time we're in synchrony today so thank you thank you DJ I, just wanted to point out that um one other concept that you've been bringing up a lot lately um that we've been experiencing and aware of is that of space, yeah, this position it's overlaid uh within a certain space that we're connected to our awareness and experience of on finer levels and we settle past the thinking and then a feeling into a sensing uh that um comes with inherently access to a finer sense of the space that we're operating in both within and, in connection to the world that we're in as far as this overlay is concerns I just want to come back around to space yeah and in using we touched it pretty good the other week when we touched space a few beats on the bigger of space the next few beats on the finer of space and the next few beats on the more original of space uh it's boom, boom uh it's a good trick that you probably will be utilizing along the way here uh yeah could be a faster form you don't have to dig your way out of a one by one to two buying and have to go through the dry walls or those or the brick walls and whatever uh just space, and uh you're, moving through those so it could be potentially a faster form of space, and in this larger space then along the way you'll say well who am I uh or where am I and who am I in this larger space and you let it show itself and mix up the character you at that level okay uh so it will be a fast trick after, a while so it was uh good that you got uh I think it felt to me uh because you were on Zoom but it felt to me after that class of space it just felt really good like a lot of people got something out of this bigger space that was there so yeah so yeah I would only say it's obvious when we're in a thinking compartmentalized or a feeling or a sensing, if I'm boxed into a very one by one thoughts into a one by one all this is if you don't understand and you don't care yes case in point through that where's my beer uh well that's also why we're trying to get to facilitate people being taught how helping them move from a one by one to a two by two to start to get the game going because we would like to have them experience some more but they can't when they're all that boxed in for them it sort of doesn't exist Lauren used the term his mother grandmother use Lauren the cold hard facts what what'd you say uh the hard cold reality okay hard reality now we don't know what level she was talking about it could have been the one by one hard reality or it could have been even the two buying the three by those are still for some people hard reality, uh, as you continue I don't think you'd use that phrase at those levels I don't think a four by four in talking about a four by four presidents experience would use that phrase but definitely a good phrase in the one by two bodies because it is well it's in, my specific case the instant I remember most was I was maybe, you know 18 19 years old involved in student protests and as very idealistic and mouthing off and she was telling me to basically you know cut the crap and, realize that the real world didn't work that way as I imagined it and she was offering hard cold reality as a contrast to my idealism there you go yeah a Sensei I, uh I, said something when um uh beef we were waiting for you that I'm happy to share again and that is that this sense of overlay that you're been talking about tonight um you know these, energies these dimensions exist all at the same time all in the same place and um, it reminds me of how the energies of radio waves move all around us and uh if we tune the radio if we ourselves are a better receiver we can hear different channels and you know that the practice is to kind of tune ourselves to be able to receive these energies at a different dimension or a different frequency I think it's the game yeah that's right calling the healers, right, they move in themselves into a finer finder and whatever they're dealing with they're picking it up finer yeah so they see things in the patient other people in the same fields are there say how'd you know that how'd you see that why'd you say that because they're still in the heavies but they've done their process they're settling opening finer Dimension and then with the patient trying yes, and yes, yeah so however you want to depict it and I'll come around again when I do senses, uh we'll kind of go over uh what we're talking about now hopefully a bit better and clearer uh so I don't people I don't know where I'm at tonight it's a very important picture, um am I missing something and I jump over something before since if I could ask a question yes um, about a year ago you showed us a similar diagram, concentric circles manifest hidden and divine but uh in that diagram it was the other way around it was a manifest on the outside Divine on the inside and I understand that there's it's kind of arbitrary how you do this okay not really concentric circles but could you explain you know right that change yes please one thing was in putting the uh divine sort of in people might have got the idea that it was in it's in their belly button or it's their they might have actually had a sense of in, uh so I thought this was a bit better yeah I go inward to a finer Dimension and then I go inward to a finer Dimension and learn the rules there the, harmony rules and uh a finer character that's there on Center stuff like that mm-hmm and then continuing if you set this up right in the green there's a potential some people will continue into the next realm of Sensei calls hidden I often call domain that's here so where are we on that yeah I mean putting manifest at this at the core of the diagram that helps reconcile it with the vortex that's yeah so I appreciate that um, so thank you thank you for the explanation yes we as I develop better and we go over things better uh I'll alter things I told you uh my first uh, uh early sense of hidden was very fine energies that the heavy dudes couldn't pick up okay it was hidden uh and then I eventually realized experienced oh wait no this is this is a whole other thing, okay it's not just a finer dimension yeah sort of following that pattern but you don't have dimensional walls once you get out of the Manifest into the domain that's here okay we can still have a sense of dimensionality but don't make it thick or hard because it's not so it's a bit Freer or much Freer okay self begins to experience itself much more, however your experiencing self in the green, manifest, creation world uh if you can pass it you have the experience of passing through to the domain Hidden World much clearer on how things work okay again a very important training place Bob you use the word on something and really to a go-between place where you're, do you remember a, go-between place where you're in this realm but you want to go to the next realm but there's a interim Place uh I think that's a transitional place and that may one of the things you taught us is that initially that transitional place may feel uncomfortable for example if you're going for a manifested hidden if you're strong in the Manifest as you make the transition you may feel like you're losing your manifest capabilities yes it's not true yeah but you feel it for a moment you could get quite confused for a bit yes because you've been using these nice set rules which you have to learn experience you have to play with have to develop very important but then when this happens if there's a for like a word to pass through uh it could be a little confusing because you still have the what uh not just the mind of the Manifest Set uh but you're, kind of used to it you developed there you are doing good and suddenly what the hell is this, is different and your own tricks sort of don't work here it's a it's a different type of tricks we had a mutual acquaintance who was very strong on manifest as it related to aikido, and then long after it was overdue began to experience the hiddenness as uh described as champagne levels and it scared the person so much that they went back to the Manifest and said I'm never going to do that again let me position them better uh that was it wasn't even that far that was the finer energy Dimensions right yeah but yeah but anyway that sense of whoa what's that yeah uh or that's why I have to go over the misunderstanding fear of the trade in downtime underworld okay because if you're not going through that you're missing a lot of experience it'll be very difficult to move through properly, again you won't be able to go as far as you can go with just awareness of sorry and I know the heavy duty awareness people don't believe me or they don't know what I'm talking about, I'm aware they're, far I'm experiencing I can sort of feel something I'm experiencing and I say I tell you a dumb story that's the bathtub you're standing near you see the steam you feel the steam but you're not in the bathtub soaking I'm sorry I present dumb stories but I'm trying to get this across anyway all right Bob as I was talking to I had this flash that back in the day we use a different story or word for this changing room place is that bring any bells up from the old days how was that the turnaround is that is that what you're referring to no, it was uh like a dressing room where it's changing place or uh it'll come to me if it's important thank you oh people where are we this is again it's sort of an important diagram so please anything that's throwing you here uh let's, clarify as best we can uh essentially one thing you did say I don't know if this is what you were thinking of is that when you first encounter, the, change uh you refer to it as sort of the difference between being kind of a tourist a green card holder a uh Citizen and then made into mayor or something you know you go through a Fuller and Fuller experience of where you are yeah and, that holds true in the green so I brought that story up still in the Manifest screen that if you're aware, you're kind of like uh you may not even be a visitor yet you got a tour guide book with pictures then you start to settle more and you're, closer in country you're a tourist okay Fuller experiential Fuller experiential here comes the green card and the citizenship you are a citizen of green has the potential right there I would remind myself about self sensing and also that uh more space more space to facilitate a cross crossover a transition words are sort of, crossover means I'm here and I'm going there and it doesn't have that distance in it it's here, okay um I realized I was at one point taking osensei's uh pipeline uh they didn't use pipeline, for you people know uh or the Golden Bridge, too much as an object that I could oh yeah I see a bridge I understand what bridges are and this one's gold wow uh that you can sort of get caught up with the measurement and, that of those words here and now the transitional the natural transitional the natural bleed through from the blue through the green and later the natural bleed through from the purple through the blue through the green and they're, so fancy standing in the purple in that land also being present there's still an old man there but he didn't look like an old man but he was still there this, so his purple was here and because uh, he was there a lot of the time of people around uh could borrow, from his vibrations uh things were pretty spiffy when he was around in the dojo okay, we're all I don't know extra sharp, it's just spiffy when he left a lot of things changed Mary Heine tells you a very good uh a couple of few days and suddenly you're realizing some of these guys are racist they weren't she didn't show anything like that before or whatever uh but they lost a lot of something because he moved away so they had been borrowing it back another a different discussion anyway, it's important that you have a sense of this so don't be afraid to say I don't quite understand this or that this is what we're here for [Music] Sensei another analogy of this overlay different context is this Anatomy book that I'm sure we're all famous of me and you've got the skeleton and then you overlay I use that all the time yeah and it's all right there it's all right yeah just one page and even one page is too much but yes it's right there yeah and the original page is still there as you overlay as you've said one layer finer onto another you know what I find happening with me as I continue the work uh these different stages I go through of oh it's close it's closer than I thought oh wow yeah to oh my God it's really close and then even more of that oh my God it's really, right here folks uh that I'll be going through some series through the later years here with that uh it really is a Here and Now that's it you all got it Dusty I have a question for you yes sir Mr Dusky um yeah that, diagram and with the Manifest in the middle I'm just wondering like can you get to the underworlds from the Manifest you damn well better it's right here okay settle open, down time down time that's why we're moving what do you think down time meant if I remember going down time to the heavenly's up here, down time settled when you when you actually sit and settle yeah it's at the beginning of, a ah trading in it's the beginning of Down Under but people don't notice those first few inches so to speak of it yeah, sometimes it feels like when it comes back up yeah but it's like it's too much and then I get lost no if you're going to be to be SM in fact I said to you a couple weeks ago this if you're a smaller Pipeline and you drill a bit and the oil gushes up this pipeline is too small it gets all tore up and thrown into the next County, because it's a small pipeline there's no problem here except you settle and open so we introduce a trick of the of creation there is more room settle and open a sense of more room or a bigger pipe there so then when it comes up it doesn't push you it comes up and it naturally balances could I say okay but if you're getting pushed I, see people getting pushed especially in their back years uh in the Aikido Dojo I'd say settle and I see him get pushed okay oh everybody's settle and open, so they said nothing new here uh the down time is to go into a deeper levels of that, comes up so to speak I think again we're going to go over downtime trade in the underside of things in the following week so I don't want to get too deep into this so stay tuned yeah thank you it's on the agenda so next week or the week after soon, oh I didn't say yo it's, Mac here um, it's Mark um just, to help with you know where, I'm at what, is a really good uh signpost to know that you uh entering a state of experiencing the hidden versus still being in the Manifest, okay what are the road signs from the Manifest of the domain is that what you're asking she's asking how will he know when he's merged moving from the Manifest into the hidden okay yeah what, was the really good signpost there well at Bob and I were saying could be a little confusion there because you're leaving this system and you're starting for lack of words and trying to move into this system yeah I don't know if that's the right way of saying kind of thing but uh or you're moving from this world which is quite definite moving past the last thick membrane, into another whole set okay how do you recognize again oh Sensei said the texture is a bit different but you got to be a pretty good sensor, sensor well to pick up that oh yes this is different it's not just another fine vibration it's not just a another level like Bobby to Robert, Sensei and stuff like that it's, a bit different okay hopefully you should recognize that difference, um will when we go into downtime and go over dark a little bit uh we might bring this piece up but let me say it briefly let me see I'm going to say it right ah that there could be right here for a lot of people a major trade in from the manifesture squared away enough in the Manifest let's say okay you have a sense of things in your vet some experience so you're pretty good in the green you don't have to follow out the green to its very outer edges because it goes on and on finer and finer and finer but just enough is a four by enough is a Nado plus enough yeah potentially depends on you if not move on to the next level and check okay uh begin to trust the self-sensing it should come more alive and make itself known there uh what seems to be important is there could be a major downtime or dark time there a major not one of the minors that we use and we'll go over uh in a Friday or two when I want to go over some of this uh we go through a minor uh shift from Bobby to Robert or one by one to a two by two I think I had two people uh we were highlighting the membrane part of it but to be okay with that moment where you don't know what's going on it's nothing's clear you're not even sure if you're any place it's sort of potentially empty or something like that yeah easy okay another important word if you think you're at this transition is easy you don't start running around be easy, let it unfold if you're there it'll unfold it's there and if you're properly there or are making up words now properly there it should just begin to unfold that it's there okay, so yeah I need to get the words certain amount of tricks to line up right to present myself right uh but then it should show when it's ready to show whatever that means okay I try to keep working too hard because I'm used to working in the linear manifest and then I'll just keep screwing this up if I keep going from Robert and Ado to Sensei to a great Sensei to a superlative Sensei I'm not going to catch this because I'm too busy upgrading kind of thing uh I would say I think essentially use this phrase with me enough is enough you need a certain amount definitely you need to practice the experience definitely but there's a certain point where enough is enough now I hate to say that because there are certain types of people that say okay I'm smart enough let's move on oh yeah I've been doing this for some years yeah but have you been doing it properly, okay I know you know but has there been an experience along with it has there been a self actually beginning to sense and make itself known a bit uh [Music], It's gotta play yeah, no, no, no, I just I just wanted to kind of get a bit of a reference because I, know when I was um training once um over with and you and you were you're running a really good class and you were really pushing, kind of you know leading us how, you do and um and uh well you know you, you you're getting us to go further yeah, I don't know I'm sorry go ahead yeah, yeah, yeah, but you know and then um in this one particular time it was it was one of my first times I suddenly it was I was I don't know something happened something changed you know and this was before I hit the weird selves and stuff I realized I was a soul uh it was a there was a and there was a there was just a change there of oh there's a there's a salt with the, self there's a self here there's a there's a me here and this just happens to be my body and then the rules sort of at that point sort of changed uh it's like yeah things were changing yeah so I'm just wondering if that if, that if that is, sort of a signpost into the beginning I was just wondering so I guess that was my question which you answered and because you, mentioned that it was the fact that, that is a maybe one of the signposts is, that a, self is more presented yeah sounds good to me now what level were you at was it a very good in the Manifest uh Bobby to Sensei level jump or were you touching this I don't know you play you bet you get self-evident you play yeah so yeah you're basic and you hang out easy hang out, so you hang up play, a little bit without interfering stuff uh it should unfold yeah, yeah, and then the words see our words are based a lot in the green world when you start shifting out of that into something else uh words get tricky, yeah even to the point where uh, talking from a finer energy from a not do to a person who's a weird Bobby uh even there can be difficult you're talking a different level language to somebody who's ah language uh but, when you when you move through the world move through this it's really difficult but let's say talk to me about that how difficult that, was how virtually impossible events [Music] yes thank you yeah so say it's it I think it you know what you're getting at is that as we move through these Dimensions it gets harder and harder to use words and, uh, you know because that okay say the, signposts are intuitive they're not they're, not statements they're just they really are just feelings and sensibilities and you know uh, uh, and so it's going into a domain where language just gets in the way and I think it's uh you know it's, why we practice with you not just sitting in lectures like this don't you think or also what happens a lot is you, have a good sense of things so you have a sense of another person and you're in relationships sensing there is a relationship and they'll at their level uh use a word for something about their experience, and you at a similar level uh it sort of instantly know oh my word is this his word is that oh okay there's no problem because we know we're experiencing at the same level give or take a little bit so you can use a different word but I'm at the same level I understand yeah, thank you I just I think it's happened me last week somebody used the word app I don't remember, what yeah somebody says I'm laying and opening, and, there's uh something that happens that there's a my soul is there I go okay I call it cells okay we've got no problem here I don't give a what you call it as long as it's the experience of it, is what it is you know you know but a Muslim calls it a different name and Catholic calls it another and an American Indians that screw all that stuff people get to the level I don't want to play word games or have you wasting your time arguing about words how many angels fit on the head of a pin what kind of is that yeah experience finer levels okay it's Mike from New Zealand um I was just going to say for me what I noticed was and realizing moving from the Manifest into the hidden and I and I, think I'd already arrived quite well in the hidden long before I really realized it was you know in watching you and trying to um imitate exactly what you did which I was seeing from the outside, that um I wasn't getting the same result and, it was what do I need to do to get that result and the realization was it's not a doing thing it's that it's the whole you know open and allow it's easy the eye it's, not so much in the body it's, in the head that we have to let go basically um if you're still hanging on yes if you still have any aorta of Bobby's brain or Mikey's brain it's interfering so you gotta let go that's first basic ah, okay well this only was the first place for me it's a it's a very important one my first bump into it I'm in a very nice meditation space nice Vibes all that stuff and suddenly I'm complaining I'm critiquing what the hell with that, critique or negative guy shouldn't be here in this beautiful space what the hell happened many years ago but I realized that I didn't really clear Bobby I did an easy Bobby to move into this I retained somehow some way a bit of too much of Bobby and there I'm in a nice meditation place but Bobby's throwing at it so to speak over critician being very negative I learned very fast you got it clear, it's very important I try to tell you this I say [Music], if you retain too much Bobby okay you can't get pregnant uh, if you're pregnant you can't get pregnant, you can't get pregnant if Bobby's there you can't have a Robert if you have half a Bobby there he's going to screw up or off it or won't be a pure full Robert will be Bobby tenting Robert so however stories we lay out it's important to clear and to really have a flavor of what that is because you're just uh screwing up the, the, the flow the trip the journey so it's a couple important tricks that we all have to learn easy the eye it was my presentation of it I'm sure other religions Bob help me he easy the eye from another religious viewpoint uh emptying the cell say what emptying the cell empty the sound yeah now again see I can't use that because I use self to represent a soul Consciousness at a certain level but, yes empty, I think that there they're using the word self as the selfish self that's me, me self that's correct empty it yeah so we can get to true self eventually here yeah so everybody's got those kinds of stories teacher and you must have one off the top of your head did we lose t-shirts yeah no I'm right here um something about clearing empty whatever, give it from a Chinese view come on you can do it yeah it's uh I think one of the words that we use in the Chinese Arts is song it's, a word called sung it's a release downward yeah it's a beautiful you know it's letting go of trying the word the, term that's often used is Wu way it's uh in the Chinese it means effortless effort effortless being and it's dropping down the, sun through the body it's a direct experience it's not as you were saying that I felt letting go and then you threw that and said yes Letting Go There It Is Well I'll let go of this stuff but this is really important to Bobby I won't let go of that long but I'll let go of all this other not, important nonsense there I've let go you're not being honest so there's a lot of I found for me a lot of inner honesty was important myself through to spiritual things I don't want to be a anything so it was important to me to be honest, okay, so I would actually spend some time with things like uh let's say a game a pro and con game I, established for myself what do I like about me at this level what your positives yeah good, what don't you like what are your negatives and right there I wouldn't say oh well I don't really want to get into my negatives whatever was there not no at this level your chicken Warrior doesn't want to say he's chicken but at a certain level I am I'm a Pisces for Christ's sakes right I told you a weak Pisces should be put to sleep at Birth that's what I meant hey we're running out of time here last, anything important about this before I get up and leave thank you so much sensei okay everyone have a good evening thank you everybody for being here thank you everybody thank you Bob thank you since I

good evening I thought I thought let me check the bread with her we're at 20 or 20. a little quiet tonight but let's before we get into tonight that was a big layout last week manifest hidden divine Big Stuff big, so, questions insights what are you doing with it yeah all right Sensei it's dusty I'll ask something if that's okay yes please um it feels like if I'm coming from the place in the middle I guess yeah the Manifest that sometimes like I like I um I'm reaching too fast for something oh yes there's an uh, a goal or an objective like a kind of can kind of see it like oh I know what I want to do how I want to move but then I, tackle it as soon as I think I can get it I and it kicks your ass back doesn't it yeah, what can I say yes you don't grab it you settle and open and let it unfold you hang out with it as it's unfolding you partake of it but not with a reaching grabbing thing like is it is it physically out here like that's an inner experience inner experience out here is my microphone and my clock and my glass of juice that's out here in here is a finer dimension as I experience a finer Dimension how I reach for the glass is a bit different better but it's inner and from inner [Applause], your view of the world you begin from inner to see the outer world at that level and it's a little bit better world foreign I get it I just always feels outer I do want to thank you real quick if I can too because last week you said when you were in high school I think it was that you were kind of questioning the world and asking like what is this kind of yeah, work in work in just work with sixth graders and going back this week I was able to look like look like because they're crazy and they're wild and this is the uh you know these are the kids that were given iPhones at Young ages and there was covet and there's chaos and they have a hard time being in their bodies but I think a lot of them are all also asking like what is this all about so it was just a different perspective with them yeah so that you do your work inner how it affects the outer for lack of words but inner work then hopefully you can help guide them if nothing else you doing that and being there at that quote better level will affect them to some degree okay if you're going to be a guide on you have to do it and have some experience so you can guide on other, people I'm not a jungian therapist but uh don't in jungian training they have to deal with their own dark craziness whatever, before they can deal with another person's stuff how can they guide them if they haven't dealt with their own and learn some tricks of how to settle open finder Dimension whatever they call it uh if you're not there experiencing that how can you be a real guide on yeah, yeah, thank you thank you so big time that layout somebody foreign I have been for a while now been working a process of settling and opening and, and clearing, thinking brain emotional brain etc, now this, past week something slightly different was taking place not just a settling opening eventually a grounding a deep of sorts a grounding and a, depth becoming available sort of but, this week there was a more clear sense of being drawn in um when you say inner finer that was sort of the quality that was taking place not just a settling and opening but uh but uh being drawn in more toward a, deep deeper level of and connecting with the world I'm in from a deeper place, from within not just yes different, quality is all okay the drawing in could be hey, your system is saying hey you can move from a finer Dimension let's move into a finer Dimension it could be the basic what it's saying trying to do okay or the draw in could be hey it's time for you to recognize the self that's there, easy there is self hearing now let's try to experience self at that level that that's those earlier levels where it's not clear and stuff like that but it's there so it could be that calling saying come on in a bit deeper here there's a self here I don't know which but you basically do the same thing with either inner finer okay inner finer and you hang out with the inner finer with some awareness experience or an experience, awareness and if it's just finer cool but eventually the self will stand out make itself more known there all right [Music], so you're basically doing the same thing whatever it is yeah so and that's all the work we're doing in the Manifest and we need some practice some development in the Manifest not forever and a day because potentially it goes on finer and finer and finer and finer and finer but you need some level so using my map uh a one by one ain't gonna do it okay two by two not really three by three maybe if any touched a bit a little something but not quite four by four generally speaking hmm self hmm finder yes and you have a sense of the finer a heavier the finer click, click, dimensionality uh a sense of the membranes that are there between each in itself can start to show a bit but it's arbitrary okay but we need a certain amount of squared away in this I would call it yeah with the Manifest basic set up rules okay and using my map one byte isn't going to do it okay uh two three four five uh [Music], or whatever way you're mapping they sense Bobby Robert not doe oh this I had a horrible day yesterday but today wasn't bad okay I'm not a bad day I don't expect great meditation things to happen potentially on a very good day yeah okay a very good day now very good what's going on in here so I can use a bad day fair day good day as sort of a guide on use your own language but, be just map it out yourself if you want I I'm a mapper so I lay things out in a map form that's a map form okay but if you want to change the words certain words don't make sense to you uh feel free as long as they're generally in the same Arena okay a couple sometime past um uh Catherine uh Catherine said she's been uh having this sense of dialoguing with other entities okay the way she was set and presenting that oh, she called some entities I call them cells, in the domain of cells but I quickly understood her use her sense of the word entities was what I call self no big deal you want to call him entity do you want to call them some level of consciousness whatever as long as we're sort of tracking together Big Time questions problems insights what do you think Sensei it's Gina hey Gina do you would I ask to go to Hidden or do I just let it unfold you know I'm used to asking yeah let me do something better but this is different it's like do I, don't want you to get into uh Dusty's thing of reaching for and trying to grab it, ain't gonna work out well right so now how are you using reaching I don't know I don't know uh maybe it's him sitting space is opening a bit since a finer space I don't reach but I might set it up with Okay cool so far so good uh but I know you're finer easy settle open I know you're finer and if I'm doing my settling opening I'm moving into the finer now you get to experience that level and hang out there for a little bit yes so just depends how you're using the words of but to move into a whole different realm like hidden seems like it's a different something different realm different genre I don't know what the word is you know what I mean do I say let's aim for hidden today is it again I like the sense of unfolding okay just let it then you go through your basic dimensionality okay and continue finer let it unfold let it show itself kind of thing yeah okay I'm here doing my best by sitting and huh opening breathing whatever chanting whatever, to finer Dimension and as I do that [Applause], I have a sense there is even finer but I don't push on it um yeah I don't know quite the right words you want to reach for it too much again okay but I do want to acknowledge that it's there does it mean I'm there yet but I acknowledge there's something better Easy let it unfold let it show itself, yeah okay got it words are a here even in the Manifest thank you thank you anything on this because this is a major, uh since they've got here yeah one thing that you emphasize which is even written on the diagram there is that these are overlay yeah they don't go anywhere Heaven is up there I prefer you not to do that yeah and uh one of the things I've gotten from that overlay is that the, three of them were kind of mutually supportive of each other so they all have a portrait of course yeah of course they're all there and there's a more original one which is the windows that they call it here in, this diagram the Divine I sometimes refer to in fact heavenlies not heavily it's because that level the and it inferreds potentially very soon here if you're playing at that level there's more of the original of it yeah so of course the original of it then the next one would be a not an excerpt but a of it and then the Manifest the heavier but it's just a continuation kind of thing, am I saying ain't bad anywhere near right that's why Jose said don't go anywhere it's here it's here but it's not here in the heavy manifest questions finer dimensions are available in the heavier manifest yes and we'll get into that on, our tonight's class a bit uh with sometimes simple good fun stuff uh but it is here it's here now Dusty if you look around you won't see it oh you see is a bunch of crazy kids it ain't here they're crazy, or people doing dumb stuff or horrible stuff it ain't here Where's God I don't see him I see that guy killing that guy oh you must move settle open into finer, finer and you'll begin to see more troops full you'll begin to be more aware of more truthful okay nothing's changed I'm probably not saying, other spiritual types have been saying forever I'm just turning them into Yankee English because I'm, a Yankee, English because I'm, a Yankee kid, okay, all right and I like to talk English even in Nike though I never pushed the Japanese talking to a chair you know okay yeah you have to learn a few basic names yeah okay after a while let's talk English okay anybody anything because big time Big Time big time but do be careful I think what one fear I always have is in talking about something very Advanced or fancy even this one uh that people may have an idea about it and they too soon say oh yeah I got it I'm I understand I'm there so one of my trepidations in laying out more original is uh that you think of your sort of understand it or you're interested in it that you're there it's like uh so I'm sometimes scared to let a big picture I have something this is Nancy hi, um I find it's helpful to kind of uh get the system going with some physical um activity physical manifest action seems to kind of wake everything up that's one thing that works for me otherwise I'm off in my head thinking you know it's, just better to do some physical thing in the morning first thing or whatever you know to kind of get the system going in that way and then from there establish yourself Here and Now yeah otherwise you're going to be here and there you know yeahness presence because we want to do that's why I keep diagramming things that way it's here and now so to establish you have a body it's establishing the here and now a bit so then when you move into a finer Dimension it's not oh find your dimension up there I'm aware of it and you're floating around someplace okay we want to do best as we can the Fuller Dimension with, the Fuller, Dimension with, the Fuller sense the finer Dimensions with a fuller sense, okay, now when I wake up the body then the rest of the Realms tend to be more available, if you've got a good starting place when you add the body to it okay now with some people my God this may be a whole evening's conversation here with some people uh they feel the pressure in the body okay and they don't like the pressure so they kind of come up into an awareness only into finer dimensions are you following me okay they meditate going into finer and finer and they get away from the pressures of the body and say oh thank God, yeah, you following me yes I know some people this could do this yeah I I'm trying to I may label that the toothpaste tube you squeeze it and this stuff shoots up and out and out okay the problem is although yes in the upper awareness styles are like meditating yes there are finer dimensions, and yes you can be up there aware of them, okay that was my beginning I did very well with upper dimensional Improvement continuation when I talk about Angelic Angels I'm damn serious when I talk about the Beauty and the whatever and up there yes it was there okay yes there was a little dribble down a little dribble down I functioned a bit better, but it was a dribble though okay I had to learn oh I finally reached a very high, high, plane I want to call it planes of dimensionality Dimension plane and I heard, go down I said is this it that's nice but is this it and I heard go down L is go down okay so but I take orders I hear it go down so I play would go down so I used to play elevator down games I uh not drown but I'd go into a great body of water and go through dimensional deeper and deeper and stuff like that to get a sense of down they didn't totally understand it that was my question when I went to Japan okay that was my question this is beautiful it works here I totally believe it I'm aware but does it exist here, here I know it existed there I had no doubt I had enough experience of in that my question was but what about here and then I saw Jose and I said oh my God yes, just to see him he was in much finer here, showing it showing it okay, so uh so uh did I lose you on that did I lose me on that, yeah no not at all yeah and then Parker my questions were I see you're operating from this finder uh now how do we get here how do we activate it how does it work okay so I'm, sort of warning people watch out for that style of meditation which is the old Norm God the father is up there yes you'll go into finer Dimensions yes it's beautiful yes quickly the pressure's off the body because you're not here anymore you're here, okay but eventually, to be proper in creation you need this whole underpark you need you need this whole underpark you need some sense of body I don't mean physical body anymore but some sense of body okay, I have a funny story with that my aunt was in this meditation group and she was in her late 80s and she wasn't in very good shape but they were all gonna they took this whole week of meditation that they were gonna see their Guardian Angel so they did all these various practices and so her guardian angel appeared and she said well what do you have to tell me the guardian angel said you need to exercise more anyway my aunt was quite confused and like didn't know what to make of it but I just thought in this context it makes sense and guardian angel in that case could have been or whoever herself and you say self what should I the person do and I said well I think you ought to hang out a bit longer I think you'd be a little healthier if you exercised then both of us should hang out here in this human realm for a bit we have a little bit more work to do whatever, indeed you want to call that a guardian angel I was okay fine I don't want to fight with you over words people I would say self okay thank you yeah okay God, basic Old Time picture right what I was what I was I thought that was uh the last week was a big picture I thought we could take a break from big picture and uh just go over some over some potential fun game you can make up on your own oh how to start this um we'll do one the old time standing practice most of you have done before to start the game going senses, okay ah so uh let's see uh Brad can I think you can do this so which we call this a Feeling okay so one of my basics in an Aikido class is uh oh okay it means I'm kind of dense but I've seen people do that bench oh yeah, as you settle easy yeah easy yeah a little opening what am I talking about the next Dimension easy set of open with the scent it during a little bit better dimension now right there I believe as he was as he was wrapping around the blend happened okay which is different oh five minutes after they locked in on you easy settle [Applause] you may have to do three to my one remember I'm a little more advanced here played with this a bit easy settle open a sense of a finer Dimension easy it felt like I believe as, he was reaching I could feel you stopped it and I'll keep it going come on up normal so before he even wraps and locks in it's already blending better level uh so these are the games we used to play again I think I mentioned uh Bob is being very good at this uh, sensing and I think we used to do a blindfolded I recall uh and uh so we'd have the person way back there and uh without making any noise, and stuff like that here I come nothing like that we didn't allow it okay everybody very quiet here but somebody decided to move in and he'd start to way before wait, wait before and he'd be right in the groove blindfolded it's just a continuation of that game going dimensional basic simple okay you, take something like that as your reference and if you're interested in playing with that I'm an Aikido or martial art type so I'm interested in that easy so I use that to go through Dimensions where I can get some feedback oh I fell asleep on that one right feedback, I don't know about this but I fell asleep oh you're not saying change for me make me look good make me look good not to say you're lying to your own system it's a nice feedback system but you have to be a little bit honest there apparently, ah but you can take that and go on and on and on quite a ways with it in a certain way okay it's no big deal but you're getting dimensional practice, with some interesting feedback that you're moving along and as you do that you're picking up other tricks of the trade like it's not just good enough for my hand to stick out there that's we're pretty good in the beginning but now it feels like something's lacking I'm gonna have more of my whole system my whole body I'm including more of this so to speak and, there not only could I feel the hand coming in but I could feel some activity here and that's why he's hopping I'm sort of under him so they Energies so uh what so playing with dimensionality getting some feedback and continuing to advance, dimensional and see what the tricks of the tree again in that one the trick of the trade was be more fully here it's not just your arm be more fully here it's the fullness of this person here in a finer Dimension zoom and again that's when I start to pick up his feet and threw it so it's been deeper under okay old time practice for Aikido people a very good one very important one okay, you don't want somebody to grab or do a different technique here and then try to do this when he's locked in maybe the actual people are nice to you and they let you do your Technique here but really he gloms on and you're gonna suddenly take him and blend with him I don't know I don't think so okay but here it says flow here's the flow but if I'm at level one heavy oh I don't think so I don't think so I don't think so unless you you've got a little skinny kid grabbing on and you're big and strong and yeah probably you can muscle them a bit so again uh I think could be nothing thank you Brad uh so I chose that as a practice form because, I need it in the Aikido okay [Applause], but I'm saying there are using senses what we call that one feeling uh I think Samuels would say no we should call that touching feeling or whatever you want to call it whatever we just did whatever you want to call that touching feeling whatever that sense is okay come up with your own word ah but maybe that doesn't excite some of you who are not aikidokes it's like who gives a kind of thing okay, uh there's been some articles I've been seeing someplace about this lady who can smell the onslaught of Parkinson's disease the hand or a piece of clothing from a person oh it's gonna hit uh that disease Parkinson's or the person she smells at uh so the doctors are working with her so they can design something physical, test to also be able to spot the onslaught of Parkinson's which it sounded like they, really can't spot the onslaught of it they see it when it's there but she can pick up in the early stages now but for us what I wouldn't like is whoa that's magic whoa I can never do that well maybe having a good nose is not your thing but she's at a certain level with smelly and uh let's use the word lineage so lineage of smelling a sense but and she has those specialty in there medical disease smelling but does this look at smelly okay let's say normally we all have about the same amount of smelling power give or take okay, but it's smelling catches your attention or it interests you or you want to play a game for developing it just to play we were into big stuff last week but play a little bit this weekend I think ah smelling if you were uh so many yeah a wine taster sniffer I think it would behoove you to I appreciate you can smell better my God the winery pays you money to come around and sniff their wines cool if you're interested here's how I would suggest your improvement of your smelling capability dimensionality okay dimensionality uh they may be getting practice in somebody handing them in oh glass of wine something rare and hoping encasing that, they are settling down and moving into a finer dimension they probably are doing something as soon as you say oh this wine was found in a in a Castle's basement and it's from 1850 you get to have a little taste hair and sniff so you're on sniffing sniff oh whoa this is special let's see how they're doing that quite likely they're settling into a better level they may not recognize what they're doing but they're doing something sure as hell okay and if you were there with a good eye you would see this wow oh wow, wow not my normal thing I normally sniff you know not my ten dollar bottles of wine that I normally wow give me a moment before I taste this I really want to appreciate it what did they say I want to settle into a better level dimensional so I can really, get a good sniff of this I said taste again tonight a good sniff of this okay uh so if smelling interests you, can upgrade your own smelly all right uh, uh I don't know you want to around and practice because it catches your attention uh then you have five different kinds of flowers and you pick one you come over here so you don't get confused and you smell that flower and you stay with it and you settle a bit and you smell it at a little better level, okay, just took the point where you're potentially smelling things you didn't on your first sniff catch [Music], you do whatever a couple levels no, rules there then you put that flower down and you smell it and you hang out you settle and you and you hang out you settle and you smell it again that's your quote next level of smelly boom, boom, when you go through all five whatever you got out there just if that interests you if that's kind of fun for you to improve your snifter okay ah so there we go nose yeah touch or feeling uh sound vibration we've touched on that also uh also uh so again it's simple basic I'll make the sound here start a little heavy I, often like to start a little heavier than my Norm so that I can really catch the improvements if I start on my best day and make this sound then the next finders might be a little hard to spot because I started kind of advanced so I purposefully like to start like with the grab I like to start for a moment with him locking in oh I, kind of like that like who the hell am I that didn't feel that coming in that oh that guy that's a certain level now I settle and what are we on now thank you what are we on now uh sound okay so could I say sound is a uh or me making a sound is a sense I don't know about it I don't mind approaching it that way and I really couldn't go any further it ran out of breath and all that stuff easy open a sense that you're moving into a finer dimension how do I know I'm moving into a finer Dimension a second check was my fingers begin the team exactly another check for somebody might be oh the room just got brighter this other sub checks that might appear in your body, or someplace there around in there okay, ah, subtle easy open finer dimension and from that finer Dimension oh and it kind of surprised me it's a long and not too bad whatever the words are a vibration thing something else came in I forgot what to say something oh it was half the sense of I'm making that sound and half of where's the sound coming from who like who's making that sound like half and half, so I wasn't I'm making a sound ah I'm making this sound this is my sound it wasn't that there's a some of that a bit of that there's also somewhere to have that coming from easy following this game here into sound if you were a singer I think this would be cool be cool you probably have your own practices but to understand dimensionality might facilitate and speed things up easy settle, d, double checking ah there's a sense of more space it's easier to sort of make a bigger Circle so there's my secondary clue in how do I know I'm at a better level before my fingers tingled here oh it just feels more spacious oh okay and, in that dimension there is a me a character and at this level [Music] okay I'm sure they didn't like the vibe of it as it started don't interfere don't negate it too fast let it let it happen see this is fun there's no money on the table here you're allowed to whatever screw up or not, hit a good level with your sound or your touch you're fine it's no there's no money on the table play enjoy it's a game ah but I did notice there seemed to be a strong emphasis on the center but no real contact with the circle better notice that okay you see I'm gonna try to figure it out now easy just I noticed it happy easy settled, a bit deeper I feel emphasis it also a sense feeling of deeper okay [Applause], and maybe that had something to do with the emphasis on the center of the last ah, see we'll see in your sense of Center to the circle well we'll see easy some contact from the center to the circle, and there's some dialogue in there like I don't know you need your partner or you can't do this alone with your lady or something or there's some dialogue with this and that Center and circle you didn't quite catch it all doesn't matter he's gonna hit it again and again and again, because I enjoy chanting or singing or just making sounds I spent many hours in the closet chanting that was not to bother the neighbors, [Music], uh, my wife at the time was very protective I was in the in the closet chanting in the phone rang she's picking him and saying he's not home right now so I could continue my work uh [Music] let's do it another old one oh you can stand I'm gonna understand you get to stand too okay most of you know the show standby all right okay I would again suggest you'd be a little bit heavy uh just so you can read the changes a little bit better and so I gotta do this perfect or something yeah let's start with the arm a little heavy uh there's a stoppage in my wrist and as I was lifting it was like oh crap in my shoulder by the way I'm amazing not much happening okay bye so I said open and sent in settling opening that you're moving into a finer Dimension interior Dusty interior the finer Dimension out there no it's my stupid couch my stupid rug and my stupid chair it's an inner finder dimension, okay, and because of this inner finer Dimension you see but I say the character at this level [Applause], well at this level arm race in my case it seemed to be more floating up I didn't feel any effort yeah that's the way it kind of flows up it feels like that what's up thanks, I'm getting a little negative uh this feels great by getting all negative about the rest of my body certainly my lineage arm, raising arm Flow It's My Line lineage, easy, settling opening in inner finer dimension again how do I know I might be in a finer Dimension they not only tingled but it got warm my fingers telling were very warm and candy but very, fairly strong heat sensation okay at this level easy this character that exists here me courageously in my case again a nice floating up might have been Fuller than last time but also a, currenting out it seems to not stop at the at my fingertips but it's touching I, have a little dark print way over there in the other room and it seems to be touching the wood block print okay I noticed it started to get tired kind of fast so I don't have long-term sustainability at the moment no big deal if that's important then it should begin to show very soon in the next or next it matches up I'm aware of quote the negatives but I, don't get involved or gee maybe I should go to the gym and work my shoulders with some dumbbells and stuff nothing wrong with that but that's something else we're doing inner uh, so, I'm in ipego so I kind of like this one demonstrated a little bit moreover yeah, here which is different than boom, boom that one tight shoulder locked in on the bicep intent, not at this level now in doing antidote another thing I'm practicing is how to sustain this, level of flow and so they have the world playing around with me you'll tend to lose it there a bit not that it's gone away but you get caught up in the world okay so we practice easy give me a moment here easy so get back to that place, ah okay ah okay let me double check yeah it's okay again please if okay it'll give me feedback felt smoother more pulled my hips in and, he said here's got pulled in yeah so it means I'm also being here more fully if I hurt just upper half you wouldn't feel its hips get pulled in quite that way yeah thank you so that's an old time practice yeah, but using that same form potential what to call it developing the senses [Applause], as fun or to improve your career as a smeller or a musician or a singer or a teacher whatever your lineage can be approached dimensionally okay but for fun you can make up games play games so whatever some of our historical games seeing energy okay in the early days we're going back to Castro Street in Mountain View what years were those Bob 's uh mid 60s to late 60s okay settle and we would just settle and just feel any warmth or tingling or what whatever easy settle sensitivity okay just to clue you in I'm beginning to feel a little bit like a Taffy pull here again maybe a little faster than you guys but guys but it feels like there's something here in our straw coming back in oh it feels like there's something here that's a little bit like a cafe pull if you know what that is or you're holding the yarn for your grandmother she can access it better or something all right now once the folks were at a pretty good level and we could tell because they say oh I'm feeling heat or I'm feeling tingling or what whatever just clued me in that there were at a fair level fair level then especially with a darker background don't do this in a bright leg room well you want to see usually uh then we'd say okay now easy can you see anything between the Palms easy, I'm feeling attack people but am I seeing anything again my floor is a little too white but after a bit for example pretty common one was to see a thread like white strings here so what I call Taffy before it in feeling I would say oh I'm seeing these white threads it was a one a lot of people would say Bob do you remember from your earlier seeing here yes that's it yeah the white strings sometimes it just felt like the space between the hands was kind of filling up with a white substance okay did this empty space suddenly had something in it yes yeah like you were uh squeezing a softball in or something yes yeah, settling continuing the game uh they could all begin to see something okay and then at that time then we would just move on to another level and I'd have two people sit out on the mat we had Ventures at the school it was very nice and we'd all sit there and the two people were eight feet apart whatever okay they're sitting there and they were like for like the word projecting towards each other kind of like an energy here take that and the other person was yeah take back so they were projecting energy back and forth, whatever, and we'd sit there with our more attuned eyes because we warmed up the eyes on this, we settled even finer and then I started to ask them can you see anything between those two people and I don't remember the way back uh late 60s way back Bob do you remember the first stages of what they were seeing kind of like waves of energy sort of like you know radio waves or you know like you see on an oscilloscope that kind of thing but, white waves of energy okay so they begin to see something between the two okay uh and then uh potentially would move into uh okay now let's watch this uke anage on the map okay and we'd sit there Etc of course okay now let's see the obvious and we watch their body moves oh he stepped in and grabbed right hand oh okay step back with his uh other foot so we'd see the obvious okay and then we would settle easy open to move into a better level dimension easy and now what do you see and of course you're still seeing the physical stuff but we've already said we saw that I saw him step in with his right foot and the other guy moved back with his left or whatever, yes so it's already been noted now at this level this level can you see something other than that okay and then they'd start to it's not there one more go wrong but settling and they'd start to, get a sense I again I don't remember this goes back pretty far but of something building up before they stepped and reached, of some of some kind of clear I'm gonna move on him here I come something like that Bob is that close enough yes I'd say yeah it was like a build up that was then going to move, yeah a build up that was then going to go into action yes yeah and uh we'd work with that for a bit and then we practice everybody doing it with uh letting them say reach and push you and again you'd settle uh and they're pushing you nothing dangerous nothing hurtful anything like that but just to get a sense of their body is coming in pushing you enough settle can you sense see can you sense and after a while people said oh I felt them right before he came in that he was going to come in that kind of thing okay thing okay and I got pretty good at that one with a game I used to play was as soon as they decided to come in and were just at first thanks beginning of the move I go nope, I'd stop him and then I was gonna get which could be a potential martial art move, the guy begins to make once he's making his move it's too late but right before you know something hate and it could throw him off under police sports once uh I was starting to get that because it's doing a lot of meditation by that time and sensing and energy and stuff uh at a Restless lady for something or other and her boyfriend was back there a ways I can't prove it if I had the strong feeling he was thinking he wanted to protect her or whatever that he was going to attack me to save his lady friend, and he felt so strong and I just looked and smiled at him and said I wouldn't do that, don't go there kind of thing you know no I can't prove that that's what he was thinking but I really felt it and by this stage I'm trusting my sensing I'm trusting it sounds very easy to say to him, don't do that man don't even think about that, yeah, uh, so in some cases you can't get feedback he didn't come up to me later and say yes I was really thinking about going to come in and punch you out uh so I didn't get any feedback on now and I still trust my sensing after a while in the early stages of sensing things you're not sure am I making this up is this really happening you're not sure but as you hang out and develop uh yeah in many cases you're getting feedback okay, my hands are still a glowing strongly Palmer's really lit up so I know I'm at a certain better level my Palms are still being very strong sorry yeah, so I trust them in a finer Dimension that's enough clue for me it's a matter of funning around spending some time until it gets clear to you a lot of things you get feedback back to the police force uh cruising around in an industrial kind of area a bunch of cars parked around night time uh, a bunch of old cards a bunch of cards big deal but one car seemed to me to be shimmering, it was like an energy Shimmer around the car, so I approached the car a few teenagers in the car hiding in the car don't know they're probably up to no bid but there they were that's what I saw with the car shimmering there's some energies in there emanating outward nowadays so sometimes you get feedback I saw out of all these cars no reason to go up to this one except this glow shimmering something around it it's not like the car was bouncing up and down okay I wouldn't have approached that I said oh a couple of lovers that's just the police mind taking in here uh so don't panic in the early stages of sensing finer levels uh that you're not sure of course you're not sure play the game you got nothing on the table it's just a little time okay, you're just smelling flowers or making sounds or letting sounds happen whatever no money on the table hang out with yourself don't be your such a bad critic on yourself that you don't even let yourself smell the flower or move your hands with a little bit of a dark background there or make a sound okay that's really a one by one Bobby critiqueer play the game hang out basically a lot of my work was just hanging out with something ah taking the time to do that that's about all added this it was a little bit of time, okay so where are we uh smelling seeing uh, I'm, not an artist here I can see Energies fairly good okay uh Boris here sees the, colors around a person that radiate from that person I would probably do something like uh really get invested in looking at colors uh I, didn't go back to flowers we had a purple flower I'd really look into the purple and just try to I don't know feel the purple just, try to get deeper into the color whatever that means or I'd have a colored chart that I stole from the uh paint store and I really invest in this color okay uh in fact I think we used to practice a little bit with that uh on the sensitivity Factor uh having him touch say the red color red there and hang out for a bit and see what, Sensations they got from the red color what their what was coming to them when they're hanging out with just red and then after a while we shift to the green and shift to the blue so they could after a while clearly distinguished that they were different so that's one of the games we played for a little while about to remember anything more on that we're they're on the colors games yeah I had a little more trouble on that because I'm colorblind so uh I uh I could get a sense of the feeling of it you know like green seemed to be a color related to healing and health as an example, yeah but uh it would have taken me a little more work than maybe the average person to try to come up to snap because I was going to play okay yeah I'm not colorblind but I flunked kindergarten colors uh so I still have trouble distinguishing is that pink or is that something else so I'm not colorblind but I flunked kindergarten colors, damn the French none they were too tough I mean leery of them in the first place anyway uh what other hey hang on uh Diane on tonight Weinberg or whatever new name is Diana I don't I don't see her tonight I was going to ask her about Andy because she was there in the days uh what other thing you worked on was kind of feeling like uh jewelry and stuff like that like that okay uh why don't you bring that up in a minute let me go back to show the colors of sensitivity uh one thing I played with for a bit was kind of fun uh you'd have somebody cut out a picture from a big picture from a magazine you'd be blindfolded whatever you just hang out with that picture and you sort of scan it with your hands and see what impression you got okay, and it was kind of fun it was a fun game I don't know I, don't recall any details predicted right now because it screwed the way back out so uh but I remember when the picture was of a, fishing at Sea when the uh and he's got his pole and the line to the uh swordfish swordfishes jumping out of the water like they do and uh so that was the picture and not scanning and, I do remember very strong feeling of uh no somebody being tied up but this, they can't move kind of thing I forget what words I used then but it was very strong you know whatever, this was that there's an immovable kind of thing, so best I can remember with that anyway I introduced that game to George Leonard he thought it was great he immediately dashed home to teach it to his two daughters he thought it was a great game he loved it uh so good personal party game have somebody cut out a picture so you don't see it previously keep your eyes closed I put a blindfold on it you're not honest and just hang out with him just scan it whatever Impressions you get you know it's fun how people describe pictures uh because they may not say oh it's a mountain and whatever uh but they'll, use words that, you can say oh yeah that's what he's picking up yeah geez it's heavier over here on this side of the picture than on this side this side feels Freer this side feels heavier on that side is the mountain this side is just blue sky or something you know but they'll, pick it up in certain ways uh, okay, okay uh Bob you wanted to bring up another old one uh yes I say uh people would ask you to like hold a piece of antique jewelry or uh watch or something like that and see what you could pick up from it and a lot of interesting things came out of those the surprise the person who knew the background of the jewelry that you did let's go over a little history so I used to do a little private group with uh what, was her name the old lady in San Francisco uh Mary eschweiler she was the first licensed woman attorney in San Francisco oh is she yeah I had a nice group of older people I would drag Bob along keep me company and they what was their group they were a study group of some yeah I don't remember they had a name but it was people interested in the kind of stuff that you did so they really uh yeah appreciated those Friday night practices yeah to give us a well-known name I don't recall the group anyway uh so it came up one night I guess where uh she had a lot of jewelry from relatives or something Bob if I screw up remind me that's right and something came up about um reading people through their personal items uh so I guess that's okay give me a piece of jewelry you know the old lady Mary you she was the collector of jewelry so knew who, it had belonged to, and easy shadow then you start to get a sense of who wore this before Mary who wore this and you start to describe the person uh not physically oh yeah although that might crop up but they're, they're sense of themselves how they move through the world or whatever, whatever and you start to lay all this out from this thing you were holding we did that at least one evening and she thought I was pretty right on or something correct yeah end this kind of games uh let's see again make sure I know yeah and again it's something you're interested in if you kind of like plants okay you may even be known to have a bit of a green thumb okay uh hey and if you're so interested then you can use that for let's use the word lineage again to settle and get to a finer Dimension and begin to see what you can see with that plant so at first of course it's going to be the obvious everything yeah I need some water probably or it's dying whatever yes settle finer Dimension what's your sense of this plant uh so you can be a better level a person with a green thumb and you probably know some people who are very good at that they'll look at the plant in your yard and go oh and it's more than just they need water okay uh whatever was telling me somebody, they went into somebody's yard and there's a plant that wasn't doing well, and they said well it doesn't like being next to that plant that kind of plant and they moved the plant that wasn't doing well and it revived real quick so certain plants don't like to hang out with other be near other plants yeah I can't quite recall the story might have been something that came from Moana I'll check with them I'll double check with them so let's say you mentioned uh somebody you knew who could uh go into a factory where they were having problems yeah instantly knew which machine was going wrong or whatever the problem she knew where the stoppage was in a production line kind of setup yeah, uh I forget what her title was but uh they'd say uh you were not producing enough we seem to have stoppage someplace somehow and she'd walk into the room and Vary to plant and, very quickly go oh I think it's over here and yes that line that line is not working right or what whatever she's very, good at it apparently yeah whether they paid her paid her she must have been producing right yeah so these weird potential talents that we have God knows I mean smelling Parkinson's and it's beginning Onslaught hey, people it's a wide open game here whatever, okay so I'm just presenting that as a fun way to develop and whatever and it could be useful you could realize you're pretty good at it and make about you could be the next show at the local Carnival oh boy oh let me go run over great plans um yeah so basically again that's it settle this level of you easy open whatever your words are to move into this next level of you and whatever your lineage is that okay word uh you're playing with then check it out again or do that movement again whatever, you're using at that level, and then continue moving to the next on lineage try it at that level so whether you're chanting or smelling flowers or doing techniques or something London shows the same old it sort of simplifies things okay now some people are sort of natural I guess we could say it this way and we're natural boom my friend who is a very good RSA up in Vancouver uh she turned 40ish or whatever the kids were now grown and, suddenly out of nowhere boom she's starting to see Energies see auras she was very good at seeing auras, but it came out of nowhere just beating was there they're just waiting for her to be at an appropriate age and finish with the sort of the home life kind of things that suddenly boom there it was uh so you don't know what college you have, okay you don't know what you want to use a reincarnation stuff uh what challenge you may have developed in past life that may still be easily available to, you okay I'm not the best dog trainer in the world uh but I was kind of natural with dogs Okay um and then more of the natural little dialogue with dogs Dog Whisperer posters and, yeah but yeah but I did recall a life of being a kennel worker the head of the kennel in this Monastery where I was at that was a young Monk's job take care of the dogs we had Tibetan Mastiffs I think it was Northern China someplace up in there uh and my young job as a young monk was to take care of the of the dog so a lot of that was carried over that I have other life related to dogs probably but I'm just not aware of them but you're just to say you don't know what's in here uh you don't know what your, inner potential is uh and I'm saying even if there isn't you can upgrade anything you're smelling you're, viewing, uh listening to people oh he sounds like he's angry yeah I think everybody heard that okay now settle and open and move through, the finer Dimension set now the next level yes he's yelling he's angry yes and at this level what okay, and see what you read there okay you'll start to pick up for example what set them off what, what triggered that, he's got a button and he got triggered, okay is that okay to say it that way enough time anyway I just sort of want to give you a bit of a break tonight make it sort of easy hopefully a bit fun and, and, to give you a uh a whole realm of things if it interests you, that you can play with using the quote dimensional game and also I, I'm sort of sad about when somebody can do something like a horse whisperer and yes, they're working from a better level and at that level their lineage is some relationship with horses it's not Magic it's just a certain level and if it got your attention you have the potential to get to that level okay I didn't do anything fancy to be a dog whisper I don't even remember how that happened, okay, uh but I must have been settled must have been a dog in front of me must have been a problem why is that dog doing that uh and, again I don't remember my first time with that but suddenly foreign, like hearing a voice not in my ear just hearing the voice so that was a kind of a natural I never trained for that although I did hang out with dogs and train dogs and were trained to dialogue with them you know kind of thing it was just sort of there um and anyway feel free to play with something yeah if it interests you to do so yeah, uh Steve I see your face up there you're playing the guitar but sometimes just I, don't know your terminology plunk out a few chords and then go dimensional yeah you do and plunk out those same chords from that level and go dimensional and from that level plunk out those same chords something should change yeah you read my mind because I was that's exactly what I was thinking that's part of my job here yeah, all right just yeah no just to approach uh lately I've been messing around with the keyboard as well and, so uh I can see taking going through one process and then uh getting finer with it and just seeing how that changes things yeah, [Music], yeah so that should be a natural thing for you to do yeah if you're interested in playing better and stuff well yeah of course yeah so you're, you're playing with something and you're getting better at something, you can't get that what you're taking eat it too you get to do your spiritual training while you're screwing around [Laughter] okay uh people you all right we're gonna finish up here so much Sensei you're welcome thank you thank you everyone

[Music] no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no [Applause], [Music], no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, [Music] foreign, [Music], thank you [Music] [Laughter] [Music] foreign, [Music] foreign thank you [Music], foreign could you tell us what you said you just composed that this afternoon yeah I composed that this afternoon and uh just in, in reflection kind of contemplation on the themes that we've been studying with Sensei a bit you know the, dark the underworld, really connecting with the value of that presence of being and uh finding our way in to uh balance with that so it's not something to be afraid of and not something to be pushed away so this was just a contemplation on that flow in uh in musical language and I hope you enjoyed it I enjoyed putting it together and playing thank you so much I'm sure everybody really appreciated it and I see sensei's ready to join us so uh wonderful here you are Sensei good evening sensei hello there will be no extra charge for that concert, thank you Deja pleasure uh okay uh okay good evening good evening ah I didn't want to change subjects too fast because the dark was such a major and I thought by jumping too fast you might think it's a minor uh so I wanted to do uh hang out with it a bit longer uh maybe take a lighter approach on it I don't know let's see what happens here ah some people have been playing with it during the week should we dialogue anybody that wants to jump in who's been playing with dark deeper dark how to hang out there the sense quality sense feeling of the dark texture anything, not a comment to be made huh uh Sensei Bob here hey Bob there one thing I noticed in terms of many things that the benefits of the dark but one in particular that uh came up this week was week was when things get a little bit intense you feel like your system's getting a little bit overheated rather than trying to control it and say you know bring it back, referencing the dark feeling the dark it sort of cools things down and uh sort of sort of cools things down and uh sort of allows you to then continue forward in a less sort of frenetic way okay uh shut up and so are you using the dark uh if you're not in a manifest linear the yeah lesser the one bites the two by the three buys the four buys or buy yes in this particular context yes that's right okay uh we might play a little bit with that right although the dark is really big time we might run around with it, within the Manifest what we call manifest and linear uh to denote and on that other map which I probably don't have here the overlay of manifest hidden which we also call uh domain the next Divine level following oh sensei's map uh those are the are the big I'm gonna have trouble we're gonna choke to death here give me a sec uh okay if that drink doesn't do it I'll grab a bottle of Scotch uh but I thought it might be fun to play around with the smaller linear levels although they may not show there a one to one to a two by two of Bobby to a Robert that may not show at that level but I thought we could front around for the practice we'll, see how, tonight goes uh thank you Bob some somebody anyone been, dabbling in the dark during the week Steve from L.A was I talked to him uh but he's not on tonight he had a family thing uh but he would play with it experimenting if we would I know nobody nothing else okay I'll tell a story they're working on this book about me you know I think you're probably all aware of that and as I was kind of mulling on my earlier history because that's part of it the uh my high school years in Judo and all that, and I remember it came to me that in high school a buddy of mine we were running around and he wanted to play a little bit uh with uh hypnosis maybe he had a little book I don't remember so we were going to experiment and so I was laying there and he was talking me through hypnosis thing and very quickly there was a deep dark there and I was going deeper into this deep dark stared the hell out of me God didn't know what to make of that and I came finding out of it of it uh it's uh that came to mind that uh it uh it's uh that came to mind that uh it was a very strong uh dark and, fear of it not knowing where I was or if I was whatever was going to happen but so my first go around on a big dark scared the hell out of me I fought out of it anyway you're not going to talk to me tonight are you yeah Sensei I'll uh I'll jump in here so one of the things that I was uh noticing about this uh to explore it uh a bit was that uh I guess the words I was coming up with was or the recognition of it was more of like an absence of uh light or an absence of stuff so it's hard to even describe it's not like it was for me like this Darkness uh realm uh but it was like an absence of Realm and that was the dark I'm sure and that again absence of stuff absent it was just like absence of Mind absence of in other words it was like a not a neutral zone but it was uh I guess when I, think of dark or when the word dark comes up I'm, like looking for some Darkness you know and that didn't seem to be the way it was showing up yeah it won't show this guy here except that level of it thinking about dark it's a thinking, about dark it's a thinking level it's not going to be the dark that we're talking about yeah, and somebody just said I didn't see the name in the in the chat that it was empty I think that's a closer word but an absence is how it felt to me in a good way you know in a way that was open not as a uh you know where is something now let me jump in for a moment uh in the early years of my introducing uh a down dark time uh which I was using water like flood waters uh at this level and in flood waters there's barns floating by dead cows and all kinds of debris of Flotsam inject them all over the place and then are settling down we'd go deeper so that heavy stuff wasn't bumping us or bugging us or catching our attention so I use that, down in a bit of a flood water sense so you reminded me of that with the way you worded it uh so yeah I'm not saying uh you know you're necessarily going to see it as dark although I think the percentage will be very high of, people at those very big Darks of experiencing it as dark uh, good old Dr Alexander proof of heaven that I marked the pages probably not uh but I don't know if I mentioned last time we were talking about dark uh I didn't mark their pages to catch them later um but his first go-around after he's passed over uh was dark okay and a lot of icky feeling there there's some kind of creepy crawlies in there we didn't like it so we in certain forms it helped and then the light showed okay no one's going to force you to stay in the dark maybe we could say so you say I've had enough of this boom they'll start to be light, that level is opening up then you went to a finer level for a while hard to tell time on the other side it's different in our time uh and then we went back to, a dark it was a much nicer dark okay uh he recognizes being a similar but he wasn't like a little child in the dark it was it was more comfortable and, stuff so he had developed so when he came back to the dark he was hitting it at should we say a better level we could say dimensional level, we could say dimensional level maybe a better dimensional level of the dark the truer of the dark and it wasn't icky and scary it was kind of pleasant okay, so if that meant anything did you finish Roy yeah okay this is Gina how are you doing my dark fans um you said something like my dark of old that I used for years that I really wasn't there but I've thought about it and I just used that one to kind of clear to, go on to a better identity that was my place to go to get finer and I didn't acknowledge it as a really you know a juicy place which I didn't get until we worked with space like I was out of space as nothing but then you could ask like what is your job like every place has a job so this week investigating the dark that I came across when trying like to go from four to five by and then bumped into this dense place and just knocked me out I don't know I when I sit down I kind of set my intention to get to Hidden so let's go through that dark is that what we're doing I mean because I keep getting bumped out this morning was better I hung out there longer and maybe once if you're reaching, and having a goal quite likely you'll get bumped out you gotta take the trip, I, you have to take the trip have the experience settling into deeper dark oh I'm going there uh that will probably screw it up a bit yeah maybe, we all have a sense we're growing someplace but we don't go on that agenda we ride the ride could I say okay now what why I said to you last week what I said to you was because you said uh oh wow this will a dark you experience a short time ago I had some heavier texture to it, was really dark very dense yeah very dense she calls it okay uh denser dark uh which can include me in a little bit uh but I had checked on her uh her self see what herself was up to and, it felt uh, more mental more the, idea thinking about it and she's starting to hit the more actual one I would say because she's feeling the texture she's starting to feel experience the texture of it yes and as you settle more easy more open more a sense of the finer texture of the dark and go along for the ride don't, you use it to get some lace you won't enjoy the ride okay, if you're on a train ticket in Chicago, you won't enjoy the countryside the train is driving through that's very important that you enjoy and experience where you're at but it has a texture could we say okay and you gotta hang out there and get finer be finer there so the texture can start to show it's a texture and, the more of it there's more of it I don't even know what towel it is because I'm not a major, here I'm mad at you but I'm not a major, here I have to hang out and, and let it let it in its dark way unfold what it is there's more going on than even I know about wow okay it's not just dark shade you see I kind of use it a lot as a dark shade okay dark shade now the next room of light now next dark shade next room a bigger finer light uh but it's more than a dark shade huh that's a good question to ask it you know like when I said what is your job and it said to open me up but I haven't gotten much more than that and open meaning, you sensing finer in more room space open so that the dark that's there and then continue easy so that the sensed experience of the dark since experience, of the dark since experience uh maybe again you can't come in with me maybe, too many questions uh where you're being intellectual traveler uh we need an experiential traveler okay and within that there of course will be a, natural after effective intelligence or knowledge most of my stuff came from experience so he said well he knows a lot or whatever that's because I had the experience and got to the level and had the experience where things were known things were known am I saying that right you're following it, thank you thank you yeah so yeah so hang out soak don't be in a rush whatever, whatever anybody else with The Experience here this week Sensei it's Justin hey hi hey hi I I've been using dark as a down time this week to um, I don't know sort of inter interspersed moments to refresh and just get for me the first levels of, past thinking and feeling into a feeling sensing of dark is very calm and nurturing for me I feel that it's a dark quiet and a calm and a peaceful at that maybe superficial level of darkness no that's fine let's say we're still in the linear manifest that's okay and that's what I thought we'd bring up tonight although it's not the major of it we need a little practice make friends better take advantage of it in your daily life a little quick down dark hate here I am more refreshed stuff like that so, far so good go exactly like that um sitting, in that for just a minute or two or three with nurture at a deeper level I have a sense of sense of um it opens a bit so there's a sense of dark and space um then I hit it at that those superficial levels often so I know there's a lot more, of a profound to be yeah, or simple daily uh Little interspersal Things, I think that's cool for me yeah that's sort of I was going to bring up tonight that type of thing uh that it's not the big darts that you know the big transitions from uh, manifest to The Domain and domain to the Divine sequence or when you die whatever size you want if you're to act you, you won't get into a much more advanced level of you, might even come around stand in line again okay sure and I thought that uh coming around that fast that there's no development really uh oh since they inferred to me uh worse than that there they could even come around a little bit lesser you know you know say a Bobby passes over doesn't handle this well uh and gets out of there real fast stands in line he could come back as a strange Bobby or a weird Bobby or not quite there Bobby so it was even worse than I thought according to Oz I'd say I, knew you weren't going to develop much if you did that too fast not take advantage of how things work but he also for no they need a little bit worse doing that so anyway just so where are we uh somebody is that okay Justin we finish yeah, yeah, so I thought you know for example when we practice say a one by two or two by or a Bobby to a Robert or a fair Day to a good day whatever patterns that you use uh use uh, that we've been using uh letting go clearing some others I forget what they are right now okay uh but just funning around with the dart just uh, maybe you could have some fun and just doing instead of those other variations just the dark variation dark and, so Bobby sits in dark rides the dark uh says he can at his level and then after about a minute five minutes how much time do you have uh and, he brings you to a better place and maybe it'll be a robber okay or taking your bad day maybe it will be a fair day okay when you do the big ones you can move through that much faster but these little games these extra few minutes you have you gotta, catch your breath or, you're getting a little tense and you're still at work you can't continue being tense so you say give me five here you know you tell your secretary no calls for five minutes and, you do your thing yes okay all right so I used to doing I came home from Japan after working Factory because there's no Aikido students who, knew what Aikido was uh and uh I would use the, break times it you know to recenter re-energize I would do something, I would go hide behind a bunch of boxes other than shipping department and go hide behind there and do my thing yeah just taking advantage of those few minutes uh that we have during, the day where we can at least it helps us not to get Tighter and Tighter and Tighter at least we sort of draw the line and say okay hold it here easy open whether I get much more advanced at that few minutes I don't know but at least it stops me from getting Tighter and Tighter and Tighter okay kind of a, dumb examples count to ten before you act out you know uh kind of that flavor that's our form Justin of coming to ten which ah use and, tonight I just wanted to keep the dark thing alive for a while uh so just using dark as a practice to get more practice with it more time with it okay, not to say you shouldn't do proper sitting with proper length of time you know whatever 20 minutes half an hour, whatever, uh but uh yeah so where are we somebody well Sensei uh this week this week practicing you know with the dark it seemed for me mostly about retuning the senses so because as the dense feeling progresses it turns out there's even though it looked like there was nothing turns out there's a lot going on in the dark, when you listen at its when you tune into it when you let, go of what you were expecting and where your mind was yeah and uh shifting yeah is that it well yeah I, had a, while back I had a pretty substantial dark experience that uh you know I don't know if we want to go into it but for this week yeah that that's been the practice the um you know I mean it seems like it should be a I mean it's the quiet is a related to The Darkness you know the still Stillness is related to The Darkness all these things are, related to Darkness okay and as we sense finer and sense finer uh the more I don't know how to say it the moral within the dark the more the dark itself can express itself show itself clarify itself okay so there's a lot going on there again even much more than I know amazing go ahead sorry Sean here Sean here I like when um uh are I can't remember what his name is but anyways when the notion of, the, sense of renewal um by going to the dark there is a sense of Renewal by going there often enough you, you know that that's a that's a, cyclical thing and that's a you can depend on that and that, sense it's almost like a, seasonal event that's we brought that up heavy duty when we were talking about downtime dark and down time for me or pretty much the same but we brought that up a lot when we were talking about downtime how natural it is look at the plants in your garden they have a down time and then they're revived and there's a seat then here three months or what whatever right you're you've been running you can't run anymore you stop and you catch your breath yourself down you're doing something's happening there okay right tonight and this week we're just majoring in the dark work in the dark I, feel like that's like if there's any sense of season that would be like winter there's a sense of Stillness there's a sense of fine and you encourage us to go finer into that sense of Stillness and finer Stillness is an experience that you can't talk about because it so still there's no utterance there's nothing there's just a sense of, presence and that comes out of I mean when that expresses itself it's self-evident it's not it doesn't need to be spoken it can only be recognized by um uh, a similar state of Stillness or deeper and finer and I'm a little careful on things like anything that seems like it's nothing or whatever it's like no it's a it's a it's a something itself yeah and as we get into US settling opening better level of sensing and spending some time sensing and sense what, kind of the right words here what it feels about itself it's, it's job its nature how it fits into the big picture because it goes quite a ways quite a ways we you know uh, anyway yeah so, ah character Eric I wanted to keep it a little bit light tonight uh you want to play a game let's play a game uh and I used to do this in different ways on the mat uh in the Aikido format uh but let's, play it here and the game is you're a normal even a little tighter a normal and human being okay you don't know nothing about dark and dimensions and stuff okay can you ah imagine you at that level or if you have trouble doing personal me uh we're talking about those four souls out there those poor excuse me dumb people those, poor excuse me dumb people those heavy people okay you got the game you're ripping for the heavy people okay now here's a normal heavy person and out of nowhere suddenly there's dark showing for them oh what's that icky poo what's their reaction what are the different reaction, what are the different reaction possibilities which ones are you picking up, that your neighbor might experience bumping into the dark apprehension nervousness okay and, based on what apprehension because, foreign apprehension come on uh, idea that there, are hidden things in the dark that are unknown yeah so any I like to control I like control I can't handle unknown it makes me nervous yeah okay something's happening it's shaping dark let's say keep it keep it on dark sense uh and I'm, going to lose control there that's what happened to me in that self-hypnosis thing when I was a teenager, I didn't have any control I was going deep dark it was like oh I'm out of here somebody, what is your heavy person experiencing bumping in the dark for the first time denial, that's not it's not part of my it's not part of my um way that I think things operate immediate my imagination yes immediately they're bouncing up off of it yeah, they don't they're not even flavored for a moment or whatever they're already this can't be happening this isn't happening I must have fell asleep here or what am I what am I doing wake up come on that kind of thing denial okay somebody what's your heavy person how are they worried it avoid it Sensei like, turn to find some light try to get away from it yeah you see that's what happened to the doctors first go-around he's in the dark and he wants out of there boom there's some light starts to show okay, you're not going to be forced as far as I know an experience you're not going to be forced to stay in the dark uh if you start screaming ah no uh again if you just do a little bit bin you're going to end up back in line and back in line be here again potentially Dumber okay uh so what we're trying to get across last week with the big darks is, why we're getting familiar with them and why I'm trying to bring up the nice sense of it is so you'll take advantage so when you do pass on Passover hopefully you'll remember this go oh, easy it's okay ride the dark better you ride the dark the Fuller you ride the dark sensing the dark the better dimensional level it can bring you okay, all right all right see again I bring up Henry Kono Henry Kono uh was not bad with the dark he had enough grounding that he carried over in the Aikido and, whatever practices he was doing where it wasn't apparently totally foreign to him so he rode the dark pretty good and then he got to be a group leader in the astral dimensional plane he's in he hit that plane a little bit special they recognized him that's why they some gathered around and he has he's got his group, okay, so he's the Sensei at that level let's say, so the better puller utilization of the dark you can move along, faster to a much better level instead of ah I'm out of here boom kind of thing okay uh, New Zealand was on and, was talking about going through the dark and, for the time allotted and uh and then she got to light and she felt refreshed like she just had a shower or something I thought yeah that's cool that kind of gives you a clue of how it works right the dark you're at a better level she was at a cleaner level okay uh for the time allotted are the fullness of the dark or her level of experiencing the dark uh got her to that level yes and I said I suggested more minor level of the dark more dark and of course, longer practice a longer time in so that you get to an even better place of you better level of you okay where are we how are we doing oh yeah we're doing a heavy, those poor souls run into dark you can't be finished if you're playing the game there ought to be some fun stuff there hit the normal person and they sit quiet for a moment and suddenly there's a whole bunch of dark there what might their reaction be what's your sense of what their reaction might be to start taking a negative angle on it for fun they might feel revulsion or like it shouldn't be there what should be there yeah I don't know if that's a proper question here but just for fun like Darkness isn't okay this is not allowed all right Jesus that's kind of weird on because we allow it every night don't pay your electricity bill see what you get paranoia yeah should be this must be the devil I must be doing something wrong oh this by the way is related to what they call the, Dark Knight of the souls, okay, uh you're doing your spiritual light work and you're moving along better light work and you're moving along better light work at a certain level a major dark may hit when that starts to hit they coined the term Dark Night of the soul but just look at, a linear progression one by one ah settle open you're kind of spiritually inclined ah you move into a two by two, by two ah again you're spiritually inclined you settle you pray you meditate whatever it is you're doing moving to three by soon now anytime now move into a four by any place around in there that could start to show okay, well this is a spiritual person who every night at the same time prays and meditates and whatever and suddenly this thing is happening what a shock okay I don't want you people to be shocked that's why we started this dark intro, okay again the game there is what should we call it changing Styles uh changing directions may not be quite right There's an opportunity to get off the Bobby Robert Nado Improvement line finer sensing it's a potentially a change of potentially it's the setup to move out of the linear manifest into the domain which is a which is overlaid remember that map you start to move into that level you don't have to continue Nado, Sensei the great not do oh my God the Magnificent now doing uh that pattern is nice but it goes on and on virtually forever okay there comes a time where when the star kids are saying hey you did good you're here now let's go into the hereness but not using exactly that same pattern now, okay and I don't know how to word this well, but we're moving into it uh your space sense will Helen your finer sensing of self will help okay because that's all involved in, there we're just I don't have to vocabulary right, here uh but we're changing styles we're moving from the Manifest linear to the hidden domain is the potential right there and people not having a heads up on that like the summer NATO spiritual people uh who got into the Dark Knight of the Soul that's basically what's happening there okay, and some of them Cut and Run they give up meditation uh some of them go a little weird there because they're spiritual types and Suddenly It's Dark and on uh they don't know what to make of it God knows what they do uh but this is an important something this is an important something okay so we're just trying to the reason to present this last week you know I'll give you a heads up on it so you recognize it uh you recognize some of the fears that the Heavies have to the point where oh that's what a heavy does I don't do that because I settle get into finer sensing more space be easy let it unfold easy let me figure it out and it won't work well easy let it unfold it'll clarify itself in your easy sensing experience so because you're going to run into this [Applause], guaranteed, okay I want you to have a heads up on it and be cool with it so you'd be a faster developer, okay, [Music] where are we somebody Sensei I don't know if this is a it's diverges hopefully not but what comes to mind, when you're when you're talking about this change of Direction in a small way albeit, is with my experience of using ground as a travel vehicle when, there's a moment, settling and opening from a level one to a deeper level of ground there's a sense of for me a gap almost I'm not hitting one floor and then another immediately there's a you know there's a there's a gap there if you will before the next odds and emptiness and not knowing that's what we when we did the one by two by three buys you all had that, pause when you moved from a one bite to a two by or two to a three uh there was a pause and things weren't clear I asked you to be easy to jump the gun Don't Panic easy and then things start to show my example would be first there's a sense of energy something moving around energy moving around and, support the more room of a three by compared to a two by and the character that starts to take up residence along the center so you got a center circle, Center and you're a three by person you ain't Bobby anymore this ain't Kansas anymore so where are we oh just that uh my, sense of things change when I pass through that membrane and so I imagine in a much larger way it's similar to what you're saying by change of Direction Change of world uh and it's a good analogy but that's my impression from my experience with ground and membranes to what you're saying about passing into the hidden the domain of self there yeah it's just it's, something a bit different because uh there could be a lot of confusion there again what they used to go along with some people call The Dark Knight of the Soul there's a little confusion because they've been spiritually developing and spiritually developing, and spiritually developing and spiritually developing and one night they're sitting there Ding and something happens that doesn't fit in with years of practice of being spiritual or upgrading Nado line kind of thing something happened what the hell easy we're giving you heads up might be that zone if you think you're at a four by four you're quite likely that's what's happening there okay easy let it unfold Don't Panic don't freak it's okay, again we're trying to give you a heads up by spending some time in the dark so if it shows in whatever form even if it shows a little bit different form you'll recognize it because there should be some, something similar so I say they know it's just empty or something whatever somehow you'll recognize as being oh it's that thing perfect, yeah are we finished Justin so yeah quite likely we don't see the dart uh, normally on a linear manifest uh, uh one by to a two by or as uh he's saying it to first floor and then your deeper second floor uh but there is a Gap a pause that's so to play the game uh we, could just say okay that's a dark time and now you're at the next stage or the next floor or the next Dimension and it turns light again but at that level and mixes up a character in his world at that level ain't Bobby anymore, as a martial artist uh get something going for you here okay don't mind me I'm sort of a heavy duty martial artist type I'm not saying you're all gonna make ah somebody would be more caring somebody would be more sensitive some of you would be more aware, I just like the monster it's like kind of fun for a while maybe I should I really like this guy you know this guy okay can you turn the camera on that guy or do I could bring it down I could try hold on try it when I saw this uh wood block print I jumped for it we're trying to turn the camera here because I don't know if I can pull it off the wall we're getting there, he is in Japanese that's Goro uprooting the bamboo not a clear shot gotta be very powerful kind of reminded me of all Sensei uprooting a tree one of his uh one of the stories about him in his strong stages and who adds a wood block print and I saw it and I grabbed it for one reason not just because I like girl but the only other uh, um wood block print that I'm aware of is one existing in the Tokyo Museum that's a beautiful uh that's not a print that's a straight away would buy uh unfortunately we took the back off a guy in 1940 Japanese fellow uh, made that did a wood block print but he made it in 1940 uh but anyway so that was part of the reason I, bought it holy here here's this wood block print the only one I'm aware of it's in Tokyo but I would have got it anyway because I like girl approving the bamboo that tickles me thank you Brad yeah okay ah so, nothing more on how, a not trained person running into dark might respond the ones you said we're, we're, good any, any others [Music] can we go a little further with it let's say they get into it a bit what's the uh what's the texture what's going on in the earlier stages of a smaller heavier dark could I say and the person starts that it drawn down into that early stage of a dark what about that one another thing yeah, yeah Sensei teacher here I have a couple observations for you hey so one of the one of the first things that, often happens is I work as worked with uh so many meditators over these decades one of the first things that you'll bump into and then it will go to the next one the one of the first things is they try to fill the space up with things they already know about so, as not to deal with, the emergence of uh what some folks have called the unknown or what's unknown to them so patience, let it unfold easy is a beautiful word right there easy also means don't panic easy it will clarify easily hang out don't freak out don't panic hang out easy and sometimes things don't clarify for me, in one session especially if it's big time I have to come back at it again another day and go at it again but it always clarifies okay, yeah that's right yeah um so trying to fill it up is one of the first things and what needs to happen often is in, doing the practice you're talking about Dark Night of the soul and the fact that people are practiced but they've practiced within a certain within certain parameters that likely feel safe to them in the Dark Knight aspect is one of those things that what you're opening into is doubt concerning everything that you've learned to that point if the dark kids God knows doubt fear Untold variety of stories yes that's right, so what I often will work with meditators on is in, terms of sitting and doing meditation as I say this is going to sound strange but you've got to have a little tolerance for Stillness people don't have they think they can just sit down and meditate but they don't have much tolerance for Stillness and I think also in the way that you're talking about uh the dark and the underworld we don't have much tolerance for them or for them could I jump in again say sure you probably won't we'll have very little as a thinker as a feeler a little bit more could we say but not a lot finer feeling maybe it's when you hit the sensing level, feeling finer feeling, finer feeling easy finer than that feeling now you're starting to potentially be in the sensing Zone okay now I do it you know here we do it in, a moment if you're actually sitting it's going to take more than a moment okay yeah, so having tolerance for that process tolerance patience [Music] yeah did you say easy the eye I think I'll write that down I remember that yeah and that, brings to a whole different subject and see if I can she said uh were they that hit a space and they don't know anything uh and they because it's not clear to them or whatever, it seems empty whatever, and they try to fill it up with stuff uh this is sometimes oh boy I gotta be careful here ah where you've learned things in your Spiritual Development absolutely yes I mean I had nine years in Catholic School that's a lot of Catholic School people so God knows as a Catholic kid what I could throw into that or, you heard Sensei say some fancy word and you think I need that word uh boy this is a whole subject in itself how, it's you following yourself back so do be careful of throwing in I don't say this carefully uh throwing in stuff you heard about and so after a while you get to trust you it's your journey it's your qualities okay that's really quite an important place and even with meditators I'll tell them you've got to unlearn meditation yeah kill the Buddha along the way yeah well there's the renza yes exactly it's starting to get in your way certain things will get in your way because they're not you and, this journey is you self all the way back to a more original Self your qualities, you, again we follow certain we need a word certain basic rules certain patterns or Santa gave me a word I can't remember what it was uh, yeah I can't remember uh a certain existing patterns of creation like Center Circle kind of thing uh, but again your personal qualities uh are yours and even if somebody has a similar quality, his color scheme on his probably a little bit different not everybody's a straight green some people are more olive green some are more uh forest green some are more you know so even if they're kind of similar it's still them with theirs you have to do you with yours referring to archetypes a personal a person's archetypes in that way or not yes and we'll get to that one day people tracking myself and we'll bring up archetypes one day sure so that's interesting uh anyways it's hard to talk about because you know you throw that out or people say oh I get to do it my way and some people are off the wall now it's like yes you but within this construct of creation there are certain patterns of the construct of creation okay, yeah in a certain way we all sit so we're sitting right okay all right when in my starting years uh there were a few yoga books around and I, would look at that uh first couple Pages where they had their ten rules ten rules and mod had some bizarre ones that were I guess mainly from India uh you don't eat hot foods and uh when you leave your wife you go live in a cave and uh, and just on and on and on so they had a variety each, book India yogurt type guy had his different 10 rules and I looked at that I said whoa, but every one of them said meditate, meditate I said that's it that's the main thing meditate okay, not hot foods cold food screw them I eat donuts and drink coffee if God is so small I can't get to him with drinking coffee and eating Donuts screw them you can't be very much if that stops it's the Thing Worth my attitude in those days uh thank you teacher did we get we got both of those right yeah, we did we're good ah yeah so it's very, touchy uh this uh I know you see somebody great and you try to mimic uh but you have to be careful because you can't sort of backtrack or follow yourself back to my original you uh in, trying to mimic them so even though Santa told me a couple of times very clearly not though I really appreciate that you really care for me and all of that uh but careful here be you okay now I still respect his bigger sense and how that works so I follow that overall pattern kind of thing uh but not I gotta be no sense I gotta look like him and move like I'm not gonna grow a white beard okay all right so again we need a word for that General teacher you get a word the general rules of creation foreign well just essentially principles and principles probably a good word I think there are certain principles there yeah that don't matter if you're a musician a fighter a lover A Healer yes develop yourself Within These principles yeah, something like that's a little hard to talk about at this moment we'll come up with a better language in one day out yeah uh, well we're bouncing around a bit interesting stuff so nobody wants to say anything about going into the dark a bit when you're hitting the I'm going to call it heavier levels this is Nancy I'm sorry say what this is Nancy, hi yes I just realized I wasn't here last week so I'm just kind of getting a start with this but I realized that the empty I always experience emptiness as a very friendly dark place because again it's there's so much space there and The Emptiness is a uh, the opposite of all this stuff or the 10 000 things and so uh but it as such it's a really friendly emptiness it's a Darkness that's uh free and no Breezy yeah you're sounding like you're into the doctor's second go around at the dark first one yeah icky and crawlies around and stuff second one I was like oh it's kind of neat and it had that tonality that you're giving yeah, that's the feeling I get today one trick you're going to since the, universe at different levels as being balanced ah I think a trick of the trade there is not to get caught up in the vastness because no tendency to sort of kind of float up and out and off uh so I'm aware it's vast but I'm right here I'm not a word this will but I'm right here not, here but here experiencing the texture of the dark let's say or what whatever I'm extreme I know it's vast but I'm, safe hold my presence I don't know if any of these words are quite right I just be careful of oh it's vast and I'm going to float off into the vastness okay uh there'll be a tendency to lose your positioning of since I would call it thank you yeah and somebody lose your ground there is a ground that needs vastness there's depth in these facets it's not just upper, half well I get the sense that in that groundingness that that's there's also a room like rootedness and like winter and you know there's, there's, space in the emptiness in the groundedness yeah definitely and very important a lot of people too many unfortunately it's an ancient problem have missed that they're spiritually aware and not enough experience, now when you're aware you can get a little experience and they think well I'm experiencing yeah but there's a major experience so I can just keep saying that over and over again thank you oh Sensei I think of when you uh comment about that, was about practicality there's a sense of um squared away um I, don't know you often demonstrate codage and, do squared away and I think of that as like utmost practicality utmost um Back to Basics yeah presence correct checking presence checking levels so you can learn kotigaiishi and I can do kotigaiishi but after a bit is this guy doing it something's not quite right and this guy can learn a little more variations with that kind of twist or what about this trick yes this trick works uh the Fuller experiential presence of culture guy is here, yeah so whatever you want to call that it's sometimes say squared away but the Fuller presence of quote, the guy issue, she had created in Bobby for kotigai ishir, not Bobby learned to do kotigai ishi and Bobby's going to do quote the guy is she better that's the constant thing I try to I think I try to like teach yeah we've got to change dimensions and realize you're changing characters there so we use kotakat Mr kotakayashi as, an example I know a lot of people aren't there, don't care about being Mr cut the guy this year but if they catch the trick they can be Mr guitar player and Mr lover and Mr healer and Mr businessman and, whatever, it's a just getting the flavor how it works so we played in a certain game form in the dojo was the intent okay anyway right away so dark, dark, dark okay anyway the game I was trying to play was the first sense of it now people react against varying from oh no this isn't happening I'm, I better get another drink or turn on the TV or something uh to uh I, see I don't have any control there I better get out of here and that's the one that happened to me when I was a teenager and my buddy's starting to put me under deep and dark and I don't know where I was but I didn't have any control up and out of there that was the last time we, played with that in those years but let's take let's take a couple minutes here ah let's erase all of that da, da as best as you can you're at a settled I can't say sense again finer feeling easy that'll happen sense of there is a little more room deeper easy step ping from finer feeling to a bit of sensing finer, feeling to a bit of sensing finer feeling finer right into sensing and sing, okay now okay now in this big deep dark you see don't shift over to thinking screw up the game don't shift back the feeling sensing finer, feeling sensing again the niceness of the dark [Music] we're all in a finer level could we call it of the dark what's the sense experience of it that's Pleasant for you in some form nice for you easy if you're saying oh thank God uh it's time to enjoy the dark thank God it's back I really been missing it easy I liked as a heavy sense of calmness okay that's not everything so we continue easy, calm and what I'm hearing the word beneficial I don't know how but I'm just going to hang out I don't stop my game and try to figure out beneficial and just okay beneficial so noted and easy, finer sensing easy hair what what's your sense experience if you were really enjoying the hell out of your dark time the sense of connection to a peaceful presence being present in a peaceful and peacefulness oh regenerative not in my word okay that was two or so minutes three minutes not bad off for two or three minutes ah there's much more in there uh that's why I tell you on your own time you should spend some time uh anything before we finish up here would you this is this is Nancy I have something, go ahead yeah I sense that there's a space in between the roots of the phenomenon like there's this deep like kind of emptiness that allows the phenomena to have space around them before they really manifest they want to have a little room to breathe if you will before you know manifesting so the roots that go between all the everything okay and I'm not sure double check that the space isn't saying the dark is bigger in the space maybe you, check I'm not sure just that I throw that out as a just that the dark is a kind of an equal amount of space or you know yeah but, space nevertheless for things to then be able to exist with the proper breathing room around them so the dart gives that like that and doing this stuff again I'd say before you can't go wrong in our Basics easy and sensing and more space deeper okay and it's for like a word the sense of finer Dimensions because you can hit the dark at first especially be a little heavier as thick and heavy icky even easy it's not easy and open or it's opening more uh so that sense of it's dimensional and it's finer and finer so you get a true read on the dark so you don't get bit by the snakes that's why I told you that story settle and open and adventurous snakes are smiling I said aha what's going on there they came from a very beautiful place very beautiful what I'm sensing seems very spacious yeah so it's, an a good word that's what we brought up uh spaces that was our Workshop space yeah take advantage of that it's good work good can be used okay people thank you oh thank you Nick yeah all right thank you so much sensei okay, here we go here we go special note of thank you to Tisha and thanks Bob Richard we're not done yes go we ain't got time for you to giggle go sorry, sorry, my sins that dark in those two minutes was quite different like I got a sense of being protected and being safe and then I, got this sense of um like being in a womb yeah, that that's come up before and yeah more than one person has mentioned womb like feeling again this the safety in it so it's telling her so to speak that she's safe she's protected it's okay to hang out here longer and really let go into it so, she's picking up that more uh the more of it and, that's nice stuff to feel if you're not quite sure to feel safe really helps again back to the doctor that was a second go-around on it where it was kind of pleasant I don't know if we use the word safe I'd have to read it again and see uh but it was It was kind of nice compared to his first one which is Icky poo get me out of here so as you play with this you infer it's finer you take advantage of it's bigger not that you have to go out bigger that way but it's bigger there's more room for it to show the reality of itself to express itself and because I can sense I can sense whatever it is okay a sensor doesn't sit over here and look at something and say well I'm sensing it sensing is, right in it right in it experiencing it so I bring up some examples like sitting in a hot tub is different than looking at the hot tub and knowing it's hot because you see the steam that's cute that's not experienced to the level that we want to talk about is when you sit in there and the heat is just permeating the whole body it's kind of like, that it's just a full permeation sensing is not I'm looking around at it and I'm sensing it I know I'm smart and I'm, sensing it uh that's not the level, okay, sensing, the self that senses partakes and experiences this fully through okay if you're too much awareness you'll see it and you'll be aware of it and you probably think you're really experiencing I'm sorry to say you're not you get kid bit I feel warmer when I get closer to the hot tub the steam is kind of coming out and touching me oh I'm experiencing I feel the warmth the warmth that's different than immersing in the tub and really soaking in there to such a degree where you can't hardly tell your body from the hot water could I say it all feels like one thing something like that damn the words people damn the words, yes thank you okay thank you thank you very much thank you thank you ciao remind us to start us off go ahead Santa Francisco Dojo 130 Sunday the 38th for anyone interested in doing the Aikido San Francisco dojo the 30th 1 30. and since I believe you're also teaching every night Tuesday now, in Mountain View yeah regular 6 30 at 8 Class, uh okay thank you so much Sensei and everyone have a good evening thank you thank you very much TJ for the wonderful things thank you Richard it was a great idea good night

foreign [Music] 26., all right all right uh carry over from last week and the inside questions whatever what did we do last week I'm waiting for somebody to remind me Steve okay we did identity, mapping um, and uh and uh, we talked about uh at some point there's going to be a shift from Identity to self and then we talked about the different finer states of self uh um on that list of words see yeah self find yourself more original Self Spirit self transparent self of the yeah at the end where you emphasize it's you and, um you know that stuck with me because you know it's, a matter of really identifying that that's, not something else that's not somewhere else that's here now it's you yeah we have to maybe we're there we have to be careful of oh I'm going to check with myself or something maybe we can overdo that and create some kind of Separation uh self is experiencing itself as self okay, anybody you use the word layered universe that you reminded me of uh following what, we just said in fact that there were multiple Dimensions occurring in the same space yeah it wasn't a different space that everything's just here in layers or whatever you called it yeah it's overlaid Dimensions that was the word sorry, okay yeah, that's again why a sense it would say don't go anywhere inner finer uh is the trajectory which sometimes originally think of oh it's finer over there in the Heavenly Direction uh again I'm here it's here and here uh just by going dimensional at first you begin to catch that uh it would look heavy or felt heavy is really has a finer level to it nicer things that are a little gross show that they're a bit nicer they're not gross or as gross as you continue very nice very nice okay that's dimensionality through the here and now yeah better anything around in here anybody but it's particularly helpful to look at the fact that there's a map of identity, sort of going along then with the map of creation yeah, he has a map too yeah, um, I want to go over that before we finish let's see uh how to fit that in now let me let me hang for a moment here yeah the if I can find it the uh map that name no to move from thinking to feeling sensing is to pressure it at a better level where you can move dimensionally properly yeah to think about Dimensions too much is missing to feel well you can only feel the heavier as it gets finer you really can't feel it but you go into sensing you can sense feel experience so that was to help set that up uh the one I was looking for Vietnamese, that one yeah so there's a map of the uh manifest creation overlaid with what we call the domain uh or hidden overlaid with the Heavenly divine okay, so it's all here okay yeah, now eventually oh and then uh what we're going to do uh so we could do a self last week apparently we did a self um, map and so we're going through here but using the map of self mapped up self mapped out self okay uh and then a finer self and a more original Self Spirit self whatever, we're moving through here on a self map so the self map is in relation or directly overlaid with uh with the uh, creation map what's a better word than creation uh okay creation map and there's a self map that overlays right there there's also a character map that overlays right now we're going to cover him tonight uh that map I hope uh well you didn't know if I wanted to bring that conversation up so early in the game but we'll come back to it if we have to okay [Applause], Erica that's a piece that gets missed a lot maybe because well for one thing uh in The Human Condition uh there's been a lot of historically a lot of uh with the body the body's horrible let's go spiritual and we go into finer with an awareness whatever but with the sense of the body is bad flagellate the body this horrible thing horrible things come up out of it ooh I want to be spiritual let's get away from the body so it's been misunderstood from the beginning and there may still be some of that lingering okay but the finer of the body of for example you get to energy Bodies Okay uh finer than that oh boy uh Mark's subtle body I think they use that term it's Tejan yes Sensei I'm right here oh okay because subtle body yeah subtle body uh exactly subtle body could be like the chakra bodies or the okay well it's not exactly the same but it's close it's close you know and the subtle the energy channels the chi channels the key channels all those various uh lines meridians and channels are considered subtle even though they may run because you've got an energy body and then we could fine-tune and say and next, is this more subtle energy body could we say it that way yeah there may be several layers or, types of energy bodies of subtle bodies yeah fine and finer and finer yes people, now eventually again am I getting ahead of myself here eventually we're gonna I want to go through with you uh following that map uh of those finer levels of body so to speak, uh and you definitely can't feel them you sense them you know okay uh and then you might sense some of the manifestations from that level like chakra body oh my oh it's radiating heart stuff oh I'm feeling more hearty or whatever okay uh but to really experience the finer that needs a fair degree of sensing okay so that's why we brought up sensing as being very important tool I would like to eventually bring up uh archetype bodies okay now again uh on my map archetype bodies so you can be aware of that now because you read a psychology book and the Young's pictures are there and stuff like that I think oh yeah I understand okay I got it but the actual archetype body experienced is at a very fine level really starts to show when you're making the move from the Manifest into the domain, area then the importance of uh, archetype bodies begins to show so you all have an archetype body or four, represent the fullness okay uh and those should also be experienced so I want to push on the experience of a body we'll start simple in the Manifest uh we'll do some of the old practices try to update your sense about them of body so first it's not like a Bobby body a robber oh not those body oh yeah uh we're getting the character okay but find your body the subtle bodies all those other words and then an important one as it gets better and better and better is this archeting body okay that has to be experienced not just known about okay and in the experience you're picking up picking up uh that encourages your let's call it four main qualities we all again in the beginning of creation we, sort of chose our own grouping and we came in on our own grouping okay in a certain way where each in our own werehold all right so somebody's a is a music Major, somebody else is a Healer major somebody, else is a Healer major somebody else is a martial arts major whatever, we each chose a different, little grouping okay all right all right and that's very important because that's you, and we want to backtrack you our work is always backtrack things that are okay we're uh we're backtracking ourselves a sense of who am I really and before I was that who was I that kind of thing and then we moved from feeling to sensing to finer sensing uh continuing to backtrack ourselves does that okay a word backtrack and yeah I've used it a lot but I don't think I've used it lately uh so I think of myself as a mapper a back tracker a researcher an Inquirer okay they're all kind of the same thing right, oh where are we where are we uh so tonight so tonight in pushing the character don't worry about the self we're not going to bring up the self I don't want to do too, much hair much hair uh in moving into finer, we're in a manifest, okay, and in the Manifest as you easily settle open moving into finer and the energies are finer okay, okay two energies he she uh centered circle, centered uh helped to make up or make up the character, so the better Harmony of those energies we can get the better they breed a better character okay it would be very hard to have uh, to have disharmony at whatever level and, have a decent character he's probably going to be a little weird Okay so Harmony of the energies to facilitate a character equal at that level with those energies your parents so to speak you got nice parents should produce a nice kid okay that, sense so this harmony of two Energies okay highlighting Harmony of two energies the character that's there are we okay so far am I saying anything properly is that all right all right push, hmm okay let's do a let's do a standing in a moment uh okay let's start simple all right following this harmony of two Energies so one form okay uh simple form we've introduced years ago I think okay up flow of Energies boom down flow of Energies oh flow of energy down flow energies okay now again as soon as possible you can oh yeah I understand yeah, and you're so thinking not good enough as at least a beginning of a feeling set here come the energies moving up through upwards and rebounding downwards to the floor and after a bit even deeper then easy settle open soon shifting to sensing of those energies here they come energies flowing upwards rebounding downwards and for me for example on because I was more into sensing I, sense the upward energies as being kind of warming I felt interior warmer and these came down were like cooling the war today okay that was me at that location, easy settle okay Energy's up rebound energies down now if you have a sense that those energies are kept some degree in harmony and up and up and the down for example should have the same sense of fullness let's say if your up is very full and you're down with a little vague then I'd say I'm not quite there yet they're not in harmony okay you can see that'll open Energies blowing up through reaching it some kind of top rebounding down downward flow of Energies being wow again for me that's beginning the up size could I say and the downsized field or equal and I also notice on the up down that there's a certain balance line at seven it just happened it just felt like oh balance okay just a sales now, because of these two energies the help energy, and the down energy take your time here mix up a character for lack of words and here you begin to feel, video very character as I feel myself I don't like the name Bobby anymore not here not, not Me Maybe I used to be but, I feel like I'm more so the character is enhanced character past the body level thank you not really clear around that definitely a Robert am I going to not go yet I'm not sure not sure someplace between Robert and Matt though reading myself as a character feeling that's the character feels himself hurts out more poorly than there might be an attitude from that character a Viewpoint or take from that character about things I've heard to get the feeling experience of the character the experience carriages having okay we've also laid that out in the past as uh for me the up energy tends to be monculine the down energy tend to be more feminine whichever for you anytime we, I say something like that the opposite will equally work if that's more comfortable for you Okay so we've done it as a male female or female male um two courses that naturally breed makes create a character here you are the better and in more Harmony the energies are the better the character ah, is that okay for or a first reminder oh so that's an old, layout an important first basic simple effective, useful every day for example if I wake up is it Bobby yeah I can just do a couple of, clicks like that and settle open facilitate and find your level of energy because I settled open mix up whatever the words makes up breed create whatever, sense you have hi of you and you're more alert you're more alive you're more capable Okay so we've how to say this we've utilized the structure of Creation with those moving forces because the structure of creation has two great forces okay is it Nagi is an army uh, Amaterasu whoever a two great forces okay, and the harmony of those forces all along the way can facilitate a better character who is an important piece of this lineup okay he's a piece that is often missed I think when people get into finer, even if they start with a lot of body presence and body yes, body but when they get into finer sensing of things I think sometimes they, uh miss that the body component continues and continues and continues whether it's at a subtle body level or, uh whatever minor energy body level whatever that body experiencing itself continues it goes all the way okay so it goes here yes through that whole layer yes and continues into the divine okay so it's important and it gets lost all right is that okay did I say that right so again we're starting at a heavier level in the Manifest okay there's already in here and, using the forces of the universe at the level we're at Energy's up Energy's down in harmony here's a character Bobby Robert Nado sensei after a while um I don't think I want to say anything more right there ah so where are we we're just up forces down forces character right any comments on the character your experience of yourself at that level character you Sensei this is Justin I want to clarify something um, for, me in my experience I am noticing a fuller sense of i as a person, but, my understanding of the word character and maybe I've been applying it differently has been my application or lineup of person depending on the situation I'm a fully available being I but am I lining up to be a fully present mechanic a chef depends where you're at if you're in the kitchen be a chef if you're in the garage be a mechanic if you're in here called character so I don't want to yeah I don't know if, we're talking about a character for me I could rephrase that or is different than the person I I'm not sure somebody can, you help, us here meaning I don't know what Kelly is talking about hell you know one thing I experienced uh specifically on this last go-round, was that the character is prepared for anything now if, I was doing a chef thing then I'd probably be a chef but this was somewhat generic but the sense was this character is lined up and balanced and ready for whatever is in front of him like a blank but available template yeah doesn't mean you'll be a great chef but if, if that's on his lineage then he should work that one a Healer or whatever your title is there yes there you are in your place of business therefore you're in the your healing character thing yeah that's something maybe character is not the best word for everybody of course of course uh you can find your own word as long as we're talking about the same unit yes yeah yes thank you anybody on anything here two forces mixing up for like a word breeding for lack of work character I had a mommy and a daddy and here I am okay, Sensei would you say that it's a certain level of Harmony in, the system at that point just a level of Harmony yeah if you don't again the basic tonight on this is, make sure you can kind of sense feel a certain level of Harmony before you check on who the character is and have the character, is and have the character makes himself up better my words ah don't do that when you haven't established there's Harmony uh because the, kid is going to be a little screwy certainly, so the better the parents the better the kid potentially so I brought up one area I had experience in this and dog breeding we always tried to get the two best dogs we could afford to breed a better line of puppies wasn't going to be 100 guaranteed the percentage was very high very high that we'd produce the breed uh forget the word uh proper uh pedigree uh so I don't I'm not even sure Sean what you were talking about but just establish that you can sense ballots so that the next phase the character is working off of two good parents and here I am better the parents better as a kid okay, basic simple kind of thing I mean in a human level that should be an easy presentation okay you don't breed uh the last uh show winner from the New York show what's it called Westminster Kettle Club you don't breed the winner of that whole show with some nondescript dog from the kennel the dog pound you don't do it it's not done okay best as you can reads best better, potentially breeds even more better okay that's why it naturally happens that I that I shift from Bobby do this to a Robert do this to another and I can experience I can feel the capability it's obvious my performance that's a chef I'd be better in the kitchen as a mechanic I'd figure out the problem faster, uh whatever, yeah as a Healer better insights to spin oh yeah I see the problem and the Lesser don't see that so they'll say to you how'd you how'd you see the how, would you know to do that if they would get to a finer level of themselves they have that capability but they're at a heavier level so when you do something sometimes it would look like magic to them she's here sensing oh uh just saying how many times has somebody said that to you how'd you know to do that how would you know to say that uh, wow how many times has that happened to you a few yes with people with the same training in your field but Susan has quote done a practice like this and moved along to sensing Susan so she sees and deals with things at that level but people still at heavier level are like whoa how'd you pull that off I never would have done that or thought to ask that question or something of course of course so, so, be it that's how it works okay ah character, um it seems like it isn't good to practice sometimes as sort of a generic character to practice I'll call it a generic character so not necessarily a mechanic or a Healer or anything else just practicing balance of the flows and then allowing whatever, yes because there is a character that is there and I think like Steve said that character would be better at whatever yeah, he's faced with if I'm following her there's something to what she's saying sometimes the generics are kind of fun because you're leaving It Wide Open where it sometimes we come in with your previous ideas or I'm, a mechanic and, that's it for me and now a better mechanic and like well yeah but I always think we don't really know who you are you happen to be a big mechanic now but let's, upgrade air or go find there and see and could be somebody there that you didn't think was possible so in a certain way you don't really know who you are who you think you are is who you think you are in a two by two is that you in a three by three well if you're doing a generic open could be somebody else starts to show there okay I had my little stint with a picking up art again no history in art uh but it just started to happen right bump into a piece and it would catch my attention and, I would buy it and, thank God if I was really broken those in those times make a fair amount of money, and strange things would happen you know walking down the street some ladies walking by uh there's a bunch of antique shops on this street that's why I was checking them out she walks by with a painting I didn't pay much attention and she stopped me and she said are you interested in buying a painting and I, wish I had but I was brand new in the game but there she was offering me this painting or she had been offered virtually nothing for it by one of the uh, junk shops there one of the antique shops there I could have got it for almost nothing and but I didn't have my glass I could see them if it was an original or something uh but had that feeling and I remember the nails were very old nails of the frame well that's a good sign if you think that if it's old doesn't mean it's valuable but it's an indication that oh this, dates back how do I know the nails that they hooked it up with are old, nails all right it's an includes you into something but again I was hurling you and when I called her back later to say okay she said too late I sold it I waited too long but just being offered it on the street these kinds of things were happening I didn't know I had any connection with artwork okay so I make a joke in my family artwork was a calendar on the wall and I'm serious that's the class I come from art is a calendar on the wall okay all right that's a real working dress uh anyway, so we don't know what's here okay I'm, working a little bit on my history for this book some of the folks are doing uh and uh I remember the story when I was in high school we had to write a paper dream class and the teachers playing I don't know light Symphony music is that an okay phrase teaches light Symphony music an okay phrase totally good yeah and we had to listen to it and write we had an hour and so I wrote this very, spiritual piece okay yeah teacher picked all the stories up read them overnight next morning for 20 holds up his mind and he said can you uh did he read it probably yes of course he read it and he said guess who wrote this so of course they're naming all the kids who were sitting in the front rows okay and I'm in the back in my leather jacket I'm the local gangster you know uh the troublemaker and he said Bob wrote it wrote it they couldn't believe it they couldn't believe it they couldn't believe it okay and I had this strong feeling you don't know who I am at the same time knowing I didn't know who I was not in high school that was the beginning of something deeper trying to show through a bit uh, don't know where I was going with that story but it'll be in print one day soon anyway where the hell all right let's go back to uh standing again here are we okay so far yeah okay now the up and down uh the he she or she he whichever way uh was how I used to introduce it at that level okay but we should double up so in doubling up we'll do the same pattern but we'll double it up let's try that okay double up so Energy's up and down easy settle open and from this direction from the top Energy's down and um okay now I'm sensing this for me as energy is up and down as being a little more well let's say sense of the center, if I don't confuse anybody of the center and the energy is down and up representing the circle of things okay, so I'm playing two beats of energy one representing the center the other representing the circle of creation okay as best as I can do because I wave my arms as I mean I'm in the finest level of creation it's just a word, but it keeps me moving along easy instead of open energies move up and down and at the same time energies from the top are moving down and up ah we open no room no room energies up and down and down and at the same time the energy is down and up should feel a bit bigger Fuller Brad yeah, maybe you're four okay one more easy set open by your level Energy's moving up forward and down by the way those up down felt much, larger okay and at the same time open up fully and that one felt almost over I'm pretty close to a balanced place for the time a lot is let's say better about it thanks because of that balance of true great forces yeah there's a character here feeling energized after a while it'd be since feeling character, after a while would be sense the character okay but at this level since fear, by your level of feeling feel the character I have more dexterity I have more sensitivity uh, I'm in some degree also in an energy world I can feel my Energy's blowing out okay so because of the bigness double beat for me he uh he or rep centered and fullness of the she circular oh the character Eric, I'm sure there's rules are very High be there in many ways this character ought to be more in some form of advanced for like the words and dead than whatever we did before which is the two Beats uh hey uh another side we talked about some people are more centered types some are more circular types this would be a good practice to start to get uh you in a better level of Harmony balance so uh by doing this you're starting to balance out circle to the center or twice a birthday you're a way down the center but you're great with the circle by doing this form uh the center improves a little bit more balance uh so I'd like to what I'm trying to do here we can shift is remind you and get you earlier into the two forces remember oh since there was a centering major uh, before he caught on that the circular forces were really important so he could continue to move on without that he wouldn't have been able to move on into an oh Sensei level okay, it would have been a damn good fighter he said really strong and tough but to move into no Sensei level you have to catch up on that circular his Center was good we had to catch up on a circle so by introducing the sense of centered circles, Center to you uh hopefully we're getting you in better balance prepping you uh so you have a better ability of passing through finer into the domain level did I say that okay is that yeah comments questions insights and say it might be interesting to note um, that uh that uh the, the movement from uh from where from where we begin in other words however we're talking about we're talking about a one by uh or a or a basic level uh I was just taken also by your story um that, your, classmates didn't know who you were but then your reflection was whether however that was that you didn't know who you were kind of now I do yeah I'm a teenager in high school yes leather jacket and my boots you know a Rebel Without a Cause hey here I am me and Marley yep exactly so um it's interesting to me that it needs you need to have a little exercise between at least a one by and a two by or a one by two by three by to have some dimensional um exercise experience yeah, so that you do so that you uh a one by does not know there are one by yeah they don't I mean we as a one by we don't, um and, I don't care as a one by no that's, the point so I don't know and I don't care so we have our we have our practices we've got you know we've got Aikido this the way that you teach it it's, always an invitation to that great to Greater dimensional you know awareness and experience of, who we are on the on the finer deeper dimensional levels but um it takes something to be kind of called into that so we take some sometimes we take for granted the fact that we can practice in the ways that we do and, you lead us in that way but it's so important to recognize that a one by does not know there are one by we, as one advice don't recognize that and it has to we have to stretch into they have to have to stretch into they have to breathe into it so your practice that you were doing that and both the initial one standing in the one that you just did those are great practices just for being able to feel past the initial identity the sense of identity in order to begin to set to create the, level of character that you're that we are potential with you know when I lay out a basic like this saying an ipeto class just a dimensional change I'm excited yeah and I say to the group wow and they go uh but I'm like wow this is Magic so simple and so effective wow we've heard it before I'm bored or whatever they do sorry students until you until you get a taste of it until you see that there's actually something there be past and into and through the words into the experience and I think that's probably why you keep working with us on the difference between awareness and thinking and dropping into the experience of something yeah and so I was getting that with Justin I totally got Justin I, was hearing what he was trying to say and trying to get the, difference between uh his understanding of what character was and how we often use it you know oh we could change the words we could say a bad day person meet a fair date person me a good day person me we could change the words but they're all right uh yeah that's right I've seen Justin's face yeah right Justin yeah, yeah as long as we're talking about this, unit that starts with this you know uh this body unit that continues into uh something much finer energy body unit that continues into something much fun subtle body unit it continues into much finer but it still it's experiencing itself as character yeah, yeah and character develops it's not just at one level of identity it has it who you are as a character who you are as character changes from level and to level in your in your dimensional work in your dimensional um uh experiencing yeah the Bobby Robert nado grammar school or kindergarten presentation is very important is feel those changes and go wow this is going to continue and continue and continue if I follow this yes, and it takes a little while for us to get to, understand that that's the nature of what you've pointed out as one by two by three by or Bobby Robert Nado kind of levels that, were not stuck even though we often feel stuck that's the that's part of what we did in the mapping of identities last time I thought that was uh that was useful yeah, yeah and to give people some nights I think we try to give people and we kind of come back around on it another time of, some of the things that people might run into that are sticking points yeah, and, explain how that works and how to not be stuck in the sticky Point okay excuse me just a misunderstanding or something yeah, well that's why a one by can drop can be dropped down into the darkness and still come up as a one body they're not coming up as a two by because they haven't had that flexibility of the experience so once you have that sense of letting go in there and you trust the universe yeah then, you can have the, dimensions of um of your one by two by three by beyond, yeah to uh to express itself as, beautiful expressions of character you have all the forces working that you're talking about the, yin yang forces of the universe yeah has many names we could even spend a few minutes but what are the names of the two forces a Sensei uh it was kind of esoteric in his practices he, really liked fire and water and the harmony Factor there was the steam the amount of steam but he really liked fire and water I kind of liked it also one of my Indian lives I bumped into fire and water when I was I forget what the American Indians call going out on a trek in Australia they call it walk about uh American Indians would go out on so long that's right it's a vision Place Vision yeah that's right Danny question test anyway uh and I was probably in the around in the Dakotas I think there's a little desert up there I think I was probably in there because it was kind of desert tea and I happen to notice the small puddle of water and the heat from the Sun and then it was uh steaming there's some Vapor steam coming from that and that sort of caught my attention okay, and I kind of like that and I played with that and probably doubled up because we had the uh, uh my brain cells are growing people uh the water on hot rocks with what do American Indians call that uh okay uh and that probably compounded that but I really like that as the American Indian so hearing no sense he'd say fire water oh okay and I kind of like that far for some people it's way too esoteric when those Sensei try to present that when he went to the astral plane after here to continue being a teacher and uh he tried to present that fire water steam he said they didn't catch it, was a it didn't work um but it's a great example of the harmony of forces isn't it yeah it is yeah but it was just a little too for them too much yeah, anyway uh thank you okay and, uh Aikido example uh Brad let me borrow you a moment hmm, apparently thank you maybe even over here, and receptive positive okay now not to do the lesser smaller form oh yeah I don't I'm gonna get them okay, easy settle open I'm playing with two forces, there's a force and I'm receptive to it here comes the fork if you'll meet that's positive now because of allowing receptive force and positive force that's my sheet Eve setup ah this character is changing improving okay so again no reception positive color it's a misunderstanding by that one by one types more room so a fuller of receptive and of course of positive so using those two forces the same way that we're doing tonight I think learning techniques doing techniques right and yeah but hey thank you thank you and you don't need a partner you'd have your imaginary partner here he comes receptive easy changing the other Force deposited reading zinc single open again here he comes receptive changing, positive and they're not telling me to be positive again there's two energies one is high the other is o okay, all right so you can practice the same thing that we're doing uh with the techniques okay so that's how I like to practice playing with the energy now better work out the two-fourths thing receptive positive, receptive and allowing the forces and, in allowing the forces this is developing the character the person is developing, uh okay well Sensei this is this is Lauren and as I listen to you tonight I, realized that last year when you talked about these things you've talked, about these things you've talked about them as the two beats of creation right, and today it's a Harmony of forces and I understand you're talking about the same thing really it's uh it's wonderful to hear the slightly different Nuance tonight yeah that's where I like to change words now and then show a different example now and then uh because sometimes we catch something but maybe not enough we change the nuance and oh and you catch it a bit clearer yeah but see again it was something trying to lay out fire water most people it's too esoteric and the whole fire water all right I even tried to mention it to one friend of mine Aikido guy uh for some reason and he, kind of got angry about it not just I don't understand I don't feel like it he's got a little pissy about it sorry uh so you got some change sometimes well let's try male female positive let's try whatever go ahead uh I remember when uh you looked at the translation came out of budo when people would say to you what does this fire water stuff and then Buddha which was written by osensei fire water was all over the place in it you know okay so Harmony of horses in whatever form we did an Aikido moving form uh we did uh up and down, and upbeats okay, I mentioned Fire and Water you don't want to play with that the harmony there would be a certain feeling sense feeling of steam if you're out of whack in that case uh too much fire burns off the water if you have too much water it drowns the fire so see just within that when they're in harmony it can steam if you're over one or over the other they, they doesn't work can I say it doesn't work can I say it doesn't work yeah the fire burns out the water or the water drowns out the fire disharmony here that kind of thing so yeah, if that if higher water catches your attention you're free to play with it keeps settling opening find your dimension sense and play with it as you continue settling open a sense of potentially finer Dimension and fire and water, and finer sensing you'll pick up more about, those two yeah uh let's do one more one more standing different one different one uh the many forms of harmonization of, two main energies here two main forces ah we did before let's do it again I'm gonna do ah my, choice you can do whatever you want I'm gonna do ah as the fourth from the center going outward and the outward or circular of course responds, oh you think so R and O I'm inferring our partners and if I facilitate them getting balanced I just have to settle and open that helps facilitate that they're balanced actually can show or happen easy oh [Music] and oh hey you know feeling do they feel the same weight the same size how was the tonality not quite yet for me not quite yet [Music] from the Outer Circle oh [Music] getting closer getting closer getting closer not perfect but getting closer for, the time allotted I could do it right here quick check ah who am I the character [Applause], well definitely has a character I have more vibration feeling of course I'm using vibration more so of course um, with the receptive positive oh of course I'm a better listener receiver and I give orders in a more proper style of course that's sort of natural because this poem we're using but character you're more than that to the force the response yeah, and of course following his practice I'm more aware of where I'm standing and of the situation around me so the center, in the circular thing is kind of evident to me I can feel that but we sort of use that form to get here so that's another oh of course of course should be so say for example if uh if I say this right if you have a kind of a warrior who tightens in and is a warrior and he's got a strong Center uh but he's not aware he's good for taking one on but if there's three twos and three over here he's gonna get killed because he won't see them he won't be aware of them okay, felt better is this guy in his Circle where the circle helped facilitate this guy remember he's made up out of both horses okay so we could use chanting as a Harmony, to get to the character we could use breathing a quick one uh let's see exhale inhale reading let's say inhale exhale okay easy step open inhaling exhaling settle open so you don't stay all day on, on that level okay so that'll open inferred set me into a finer Dimension where the inhale is more than what your nose is doing more than even what your chest is doing, inhale you like vice versa exhale inhale again [Applause] so using the breathing as two forces and again the recognition when they seem to be in harmony okay and that's a sense feeling okay, because you're breathing sort of doesn't mean they're in harmony I sense because I'm in the fire I'm sensing thee if they feel more people then I'll check character did I say that okay ah Okay so, I think I'm also saying you can use anything to represent the two forces body movement uh you know golfers back or tennis whatever okay you can use Sound Vibrations to represent breathing a lot of people like breathing to represent okay a lot of people use things let's see breathing for example maybe uh and because of the balance of grieving they experience calmness and how to say this properly nicely and they say oh that's it I'm calling but who's the character I'm a calm character yeah yes but who is the character the character, person who's the character okay or if we were including self which we're not doing tonight uh yes now there's a self here at this level what's a self sense with itself what's, a self sense with itself what's the self-experience with itself as self so it's not just calmness oh I've arrived it's calm I can see where that's great if you started as a nervous person to be able to get to some calmness that must be a while but for the depth of the work that we do that's like that's it you're going to stop there dear God come on let's go come on there's more okay kind of thing anyway but where are we observations insights which are those what would you think your favorite might be we had movement I like you know we had Basic Energy of down sense uh we had sound vibration chanting we had breathing pretty, good assembly of to rep for the Jews can we can we can we select all of the above yeah, yeah, although some might want to Major for a little while yeah I had my chanting years really enjoyed the hell out of it and then it just sort of disappeared and something else came into play also don't mind that if you have your favorite and you're doing it well every day every week whatever and it's really great it's really grapes really great for you, really like it and then one day it's sort of not there all right Don't Panic as things like to change a bit I don't know how to say this well right now but it might be something else maybe it uh maybe you'll get caught up with breathing practice as opposed to chanting practice or maybe you'll say ah I think I feel like moving a bit like moving uh so it could be anything could be really good and then I don't know what to call that it gets stale or its time is up it's like that's very good for that period of time now let's change into something else here and something else will present itself that's a common occurrence in the work that we, do okay and uh and so we mentioned stories that let's say you're uh into your inner work one day you experience a quality that's really nice or a level that's really, nice or a level that's really nice you really like it wow and the next day you try for it again oh boy that was so wild yesterday I want to get back there again and then you go for it and you go for it and you go from the damn thing won't show and you're doing your best okay because it may be that was great yesterday but today what's for today and allow today's presentation okay so quite likely you'll make that mistake of trying to repeat a good yesterday today when it's changing something else wants to appear there's more than one thing they want turns here okay, it's like vegetable cage but Sally's had all the turns and I don't get any turns it's kind of like that in your own system, they want to change for their turn and, we should fine tune that one, day uh, yeah anyways so we have a map of the space [Applause] creation, in the form that it creates all right you have another word that I click on right now which was made today blanking okay the structure there we go the structure of creation and that's sort of that Mac okay, then we have a map of self and then to find yourself a more original itself uh spirit self and transparency of self whoa, now these are easy words to say but to actually experience you got to be at that level okay so because you learn the words and memorize them doesn't mean people I'm sorry to tell you the actual experience then we have the uh we said the characters map okay that Bobby Robert Nado with an eventually energy body and eventually, energy body and eventually finer than that whatever he or your causal body whatever uh and, I'll bring up one evening uh art type bodies a little clearer following that pattern okay so you've got uh, so we did this map and we laid it out in three pieces uh the threes that I'm talking about right now are the yes now that's one back the character development is another map that's right there the self development self becoming more self-aware process is another map and they all overlay right they'll overlay their in tandem could I say they're in tandem uh I think some people are surprised was it last week or late lately uh, I said well that's something like we're in a space and somebody said something like maybe I'm not sure where I'm at oh okay but you, can change the form in this space, who is the character here and then click it the character map is there and will be the character at that level of space or who am I the self here or I, think maybe they were doing self but they weren't sure where they were themselves can say then you can say okay I have a sense of self very good I just don't know where I'm at and then ask for this map in the construct of creation where am I and then you get a different map that's right there that'll clue you in as to where you are because they're in relation they're overlaid they work in tandem, I don't know if I said that well but uh you can bounce back and forth on them properly either carefully we'll bounce back and forth but uh work them and tandem, you know okay they facilitate each other see like more space more room gives more room for the character to have more room to show the Fuller of character same thing more space more room the self has a little more room to experience itself as itself okay so they're working in tandem I, call that they facilitate each other that's okay yeah did you get anything out of that Sensei uh I, wonder if I could ask a question and that is uh you talked about mind-body Harmony new forces and I feel like creation I feel like I feel like tonight you've kind of brought us into harmony of forces without using the phrase mind-body Harmony but isn't this really what you were talking about years and years ago I didn't think to use the Mind Body I was happy with centered a circle or oh I just didn't think to use mind body but yeah the great mind of creation and the great body of creation there's two pieces there and uh and from the beginning for some stupid reason we got more in tune with the mind or awareness of things and really lost the fullness of the body now I have to care for the word body because people think of body this thing body I don't mean that body that's where we start because we're embodied we're in a one by one two by two we're embodied uh but the body is, a great Universal size, amounts of energy that in its finest called spirit yeah that's the body and there's intelligence there aware that experiences experiencing it is aware it has a brain and a body yeah so yeah that would be fine yeah I'm just leery sometimes a Mind Body because uh the humans do weird little things with that of that phrasing sometimes yeah thank you because I have a good mind I tell my body what to do I'm the boss of my body for example like no, sometimes you want to reverse and say body what do you want to do okay whatever, whatever, anyway so yeah Mind Body reps the two great horses I just don't like what humans do with that phrasing they can screw it up badly I think we're finishing up people anything that'll keep you awake if you want to get into real fast nothing are we finished okay thank you so much Sensei thank you I remember the time change yarn time change time change we fall back an hour in California and the United States so in New Zealand Danny please make sure everybody knows you know I put it on the notices and I'll put it in red this coming but we'll be an hour shift and in South America I don't know if Joanna's here and thank you everyone and you'll still be here Sensei right same time same place thank you everyone thank you thank you thank you thank you okay bye-bye bye

out, some big stuff the last few three-part sessions especially some big pieces uh that you're sort of comfortable with it hopefully you've been playing experiencing whatever we've been laying out, uh, since I didn't hear from Danny um yeah um yeah um I'll think about it two months ago I oh for me I had an experience that really highlights what you've presented here the thinking feeling sensing and it was at a point in my recovery that I felt, there wasn't a lot happening and I sat out on the porch you know the porch oh yeah it was yeah a lot of coffee and cigarettes on that porch yes yeah um and there was a patch of sunshine which I sat in because I was really quite cold and I recall thinking how nice it was to feel the depth of the sun on my body and at the same time acknowledging or accepting I actually felt like crap and I had a lot of mental stuff going on and as that happened I started to settle deeper into it and, started to fill my body and how I was in the moment then I felt or I sensed an energy outside of me which me which I ceased flowing into my into my horror and then horizontally and then like this word was stay with it and it filled my body up and, and, expanded it and then I felt the energy to leave again and this happened the day after as well but significantly from that point on I started to walk which I hadn't been doing and I started to exercise and good my healing took on another um yeah all my recuperation at least took on a, another level time for me to jump in uh two, things my attention there one when you're first settling and you felt the energy coming in from the side could I say that it's staying there and hanging out did it not reposition itself more to the Middle where you said your body goes yeah yes that I picked up your self as being off to the side of it yes are we in that Arena the second thing was it went away the uh whatever you said the energy went away or what whatever yeah uh quite possibly right there uh I might say I might if it happens again go over it uh it didn't go away but there's another level of it so if you've got time you want to continue your, process uh your inquiry uh that you do some kind of trade in there just pick up another level of that energy force that's there would be what I might do with it because it doesn't just go away go away uh all right yeah it might be uh it's not showing at this level to get more of it showing we have to trade in and get to another level where it'll show at that level, where it'll show at that level that would be my guess as to what as to what you should do that's what I might do but play, with it you know if it happens again double check it you play with it with that, that sense but uh thank you yeah very much yeah, um I, think also um, yeah I was yeah I was I kind of felt that it was an experience I didn't feel like going anywhere else with it, was it was quite significant and um but yeah maybe that was a bit of laziness not, working with it more it kind of depends on how much maybe it was the end of the session and maybe you know you had done enough you felt you had done enough uh ear more limited in your endurance let's say and maybe that was just okay to the curtains are now closing it's, finished for the day oh come back at it another day and see if we can get to an even finer level could have been the end of the day your call there your call, yeah all right energy you have to continue how much interest you have in continuing or is it the end of it for the Day miracle okay but I'd like to at least present it as a possibility so people don't uh don't what let's say cut it too short or get lazy too fast could I say it that way and not real well but yeah, no, that if I'm just sitting saying about on my front porch and, I've got an awkward there at least and uh in five minutes something nice happens and I said oh that's the end of it now I, don't think so I'm out there you know I've got an hour free I'm not going to finish in five minutes say that's it and I'm gonna double check trade in maybe it's something else maybe it's just changing scenery maybe it's not the character maybe it's maybe it's not the character maybe it's the self wants a turn and then I easy and self maybe wants to show how to construct a creation works but if I've got time and I'm not tired no place to go then I'll continue yeah, see, what's trying to unfold there yeah, blessing I think I said the same thing okay people where are we going what are we missing uh what should we highlight more I have some ideas but again I'm not sure for all ready for another big piece and another big piece uh I don't want it to become a an informational library and then we don't do anything or have time to play and experience these things blah, blah so where the hell are we talk to me yeah hey Sensei it's dusty owe us something if that's okay um that's why we're here yeah I was talking to Noah Sensei and I kind of missed someone last week we I guess we're talking about a map of creation a map itself and a map of character and hey and hey I guess what I'm wondering is like do you need a map of self and a map of character like when you have when you're working with the map of creation or uh, I think we have presented or if I haven't done it well we will uh of main pieces okay a main piece is self for example okay ah, and you can spend some time just majoring in that and when I think when we when we presented itself a lot of people ooh like playing with that and wanted to major in it for a time that's fine, okay, it's not the only piece but it itself needs some practice time of allowing self finer levels of self to show, so that's a main piece okay now that's self is going on in the creation thing another time the other creation Works centered a circle and the Beats of energy whatever and it may want to show then you just highlight that and you major on that for that session or that day or that week or maybe even that month, okay yeah and then there's the character who a lot of people stop short with they think of the character as the body Bobby Robert not those Sensei that's it now it's getting finer there's no more character, potentially they've gone off to mental character continues so soon we'll get into the continuation of character uh heading towards archetype as a much finer level of self it's you our types our main aspects of you so we'll, get into the continuation of self and that's a major yeah, did I lay this on all right so there's three major pieces here yeah um, I guess I'm already asked if it's okay I'll just when I was more Manic and I kind of when you were what I have a bipolar thing and I get more manic sometimes and oh I got real panic for a while and I couldn't stop thinking about concentric circles and like circles revolving around me this was kind of before I did a keto but I'm wondering I'm like just I had these circles going around my neck and my chest and then around my horror area and it I don't know kind of I seems like there's Maps like built within us somehow and um I, guess I'm just one yeah you answered my question I've got a lot um let's go back to the circles I started wondering where the circles fit in here is that what you're asking, yeah or if the circles is that just thoughts remember we did a session on space easy there's a finer bigger space here easy there's a finer space here or a more original space we may have said same, same thing more original bigger finder uh possibly those circles were the feel like you're choking like it's a tight band on your neck or something settle and more easy it touches the heart area easy and you feel a little bit different at that level touches the a little bit since a little bit larger one it's touching the hotter air area easy, physically you begin to feel better and more open and looser plus all the nice feelings being sort of okay more okay so possibly a circular pattern was laying out and I would might call that right or wrong I might call that the space that a space may be a very important word we've got character we got self we got the how the structure of creation works and space I want to come back on Space maybe even next week uh it could be an important component to have some experience with in more space a better character in more in more space a better character in more space a truer self-selfing a selfie in more space creation can unfold better at that level of how it works so space May uh may be a major I'm researching and playing with it myself to find fine tune it let's see if I can should present it that way as a major thing yeah so that would be my yes wonderment if, what you're getting yeah no thank you just what you said resonated so yeah so something like just for something if you notice a, circular happening around you uh then I would say oh okay uh space wants a present let's, make up those words space wants to present okay easy, settle open and more space at which time soon not the first one necessarily but a couple uh should be a sense of a little bigger circle and a sense of more space, uh, so for onto anything uh next time you pick up a circle you play with it a bit that way uh and, if that's it, should unfold that way is that okay did I say it right yeah, no you always make things not so complicated so yeah I think that's part of my job you know I think thank you foreign, for every man not for intellectuals because I'm not I'm not Einstein I can't laid out that way, I know about math I can't really lay it out that way a little psychology yeah I can do a little bit there uh physical movement stuff not bad I'm not bad there I can lay it out a bit there, uh but somehow to present itself anybody and everybody should, catch, how it works catch potentially the simplicity, pain in the ass sometimes but there is in there hey an intelligence or potential simplicity it doesn't mean we're not going to trip stumble and Hawa what the hell's going on what does this mean kind of thing you know uh but do the best we can anyway ah The Human Condition people where are we where are we where are you anything we're missing you want to say do more of and I'll draw a little boat down here uh we'll all marked on his uh, his uh, space where like you already got space, where like you already got space written down from this week but let me jot it down here space okay somebody where are we where are we going the Sensei this is Lauren uh a few weeks ago you showed a different diagram uh, um the concentric squares inside of a circle right the progression of character development as opposed to non-linear the linear progression of character development one by two by oh there it is there it is one second alternative page that one that one that one and that one that one that one that one and that one caught your attention it did something for you so it did at the time but I, wonder if you might just review it oh hell I can't even remember what that was all about what did you get out of it to start me going well you had been talking about uh character development in the progression one by two by or bad day fair day good day any one of those, sort of sequential progressions being kind of linear in the Manifest world and building your character in a manifest World appropriate for the situation in the Manifest world okay you know but that to let's say uh go out into the hidden Dimension, operate non-linear yes you have to actually let go of the linear style linear style yes thank you for doing your style that's what caught me yeah and, it clarified for me um uh, uh the membrane what you've previously have called the membrane between the dimensions, all right that and allowing The Passage through that membrane is it's kind of similar to what I've just called letting go of the linear linearity of the Manifest World in order to, access the or ride the non-linearity of the Hidden dimension and, for some reason the square inside the circle you know did something for you it did it for me yeah, yeah and so um because we've been talking about character and situation and we've been talking about dimensionality but uh I mean I suppose that this diagram as elegant as it is now, you, know could have a second circle around it uh you know signifying the demand the divine, um yeah uh okay first uh I'm I had to but I'm sorry we had to throw that word out there because the domain, level is very important okay now we're getting a little ahead but I will try to lay this out another time as a special class uh but I see I'm not sure where you're all at we need a certain amount of setup in the manifest linear to [Applause] make a move on don't have the words here make a move on uh to domain to domain like if you have no sense or experience of self it's going to be tricky if you don't have a sense of body and body's experience, is going to be tricky if you don't have any sense of the construct Center Circle or anything and the vibrations that are there you're going to have a little trouble so I got to make sure that in the linear manifest World you've got certain basics down okay because you need certain Basics to properly, make uh I, don't have the words here make a move on to stop doing upgrading linear which was very good in its time we needed it Bobby Robert nabo we needed it okay but then we like are going to change directions that's not the right phrase one reason I haven't presented it yet is I haven't worded it well yet so bear with me here uh, gift Auto Sensei would say to me uh the linear is getting finer and finer and finer and finer okay Bobby Robert Nado okay finer and finer and finer when you make a move towards the non-linear or the domain he likes the word there uh more original so it's a shift from finer finder finer that's nice you did good okay you're not a Bobby anymore you're not a one by one or who won't understand any of this anyway certain amount of something now more original, so it in that change I call that a change of Direction and that's, not a good proper word but it is a change of styles I'm used to upgrading I've been doing that for years and teaching that for that for years and teaching that for years how to go from a Bobby to a robber stuff you know where I came up with a one by two or two by or a bad day to a fair day kind of stuff all that stuff very good but more original I'm I don't know the word Jets anytime you get the feeling for words for, y'all, essentially aren't you already using the words that's that this larger circle is the domain of the self the domain of the self the domain of non-linear hidden dimensions and hidden energy okay if you do it that way if you do it that way the domain is a very important training place big time training place that's why I don't want you to jump into the circle of divine not yet not yet the domain is the training place so that you'll be proper in the domain mm-hmm yeah right so again right we have to throw the word out to be sort of a big this map a big schematic of things manifest the hidden domain oh Divine now I know what people are going to do screw that domain stuff I'm gone for the Divine and no screw it all up I'm sorry screw it all up because you haven't set up the proper pieces to properly move into the domain to train there for a little bit which is the setup for being proper in the divine in, a way it feels like the, training in the domain is to find the frame with which the flow can occur I want to even say safely but fully you know in that in that Dimension that right so thank you Sensei calls it to me yeah the domain is the library okay, a lot of information unfolding of how things work okay with the stipulation that a lot of people are just going to be Library types and they'll be aware of that okay but it's also a laboratory where you practice with certain things to get a real experiential for like the word feeling for the finer of things and how they work and we're not finished it's also a gym a gym and for me the word gym seems to point a little bit to the continuing of the character at that level of domain and right there is where I want to bring up the archetype cells okay see unfortunately in the linear you've heard the word archetype you read the book you saw the pictures you think you understand our types well we haven't experienced your archetype or types yet but it's starting to show and be become important in the shift to The Domain in this trade-in to The Domain so self and character and construct of creation all will be finer in the domain to be experienced and to play in there a bit to get well versed in it we'll see about the Divine when that comes up but nothing we don't need that word right now we're going to have enough to do from here to The Domain I don't know if I said anything proper did I yes thank you so much but just take time for me to, get the right wording or wording it'll get the sense across and I'm not quite there yet uh, uh, you know I'm sorry it was so I called it a change of directions or no that's not quite right uh and certain things I do know oh there's a big trade in here you know like you're trading it all of the linear manifest and boom we're approaching and beginning to be in the domain okay um again having had some practice before we've done this with character self and a bit of the construct and uh I just mentioned to Dusty uh, uh space it's showing strong again I want to come back on Space we might need a sense of uh more space more space a more original space uh to facilitate this move so I'm working on it bear with me all right and be careful when we lay certain things out like the self a lot of people are like whoa yes the self oh now I'm home free I really love the self uh and it's like yes a very important piece my God yes but it's not the only piece okay, foreign who majored himself but in other ways his life was a bit of a shambles uh I don't even think he had a sense of really the construct of things but he had a good self okay and the problem with one approach is they can be very special but somebody who did this work just as character would also be very special their way their way and attract attention somebody who had a sense of the construct and was okay with the construct would be very special their way and draw a lot of attention also potentially confusing their followers by saying this one is it self only self only and I said well if you got no character we're missing something you got no sense of the structure and the continuing of the structure you're going to screw up a bit here uh so uh so when any one piece says it's important it might even say it's everything now it's everything it's peace it doesn't mean it's everything, but that's what it'll say maybe that's how you'll pick it up okay that's not to say you can't highlight that one for quite a while you know some of you were enthused with self good spend some time give it more room so it can show experience that more of itself as self nothing wrong with that, but it's not the end-all it's not the only piece and then the following month or something I'll come up with now this is an important piece this is called character you go wait a minute is it self-important yes we have a uh a threesies or a frenzies game going on here we need all these pieces properly to go fully, fully uh it would pick up a lot in the uh in the domain practice place only properly fully properly it should naturally drift into the Divine of things, and don't worry about that we have enough to do right where we're at, getting ready to make this shift from, linear Improvement to more original domain level gymnasium Library Laboratory okay, yeah, and I, like the way of since he told me those words uh just the library of it is knowledge for a lot of people and so yeah they'll be something to be aware but there's no uh one part let's say the character, as an exercise there let's say uh using terminology we understand character hasn't exercised uh in the domain so something's going to be missing we need all the pieces there okay they've potentially facilitate each other okay some of you didn't know that before I think it came up uh I don't know we two weeks ago somebody said oh I didn't know that a, character could uh could check Itself by asking the uh the uh structure where it was or itself could say Okay self, now who am I as a character and that changes then character can begin to show at this level of self here is the character who you are I am or at this level of self gee we're, quite at where exactly am I love of lies in the construct of creation and then the common struct will show at that level equal to your size of self or your size of character that they'll relate to each other they'll support each other so you can oh, come I need a word compare them now they reinforce each other yeah they, help each other develop yeah, yeah it's a nice system that what's his name created pain in the ass sometimes but it's, it's, it's showing nicer and nicer and smoother and smoother and whatever, or else as I said they would say Nago it's so easy, but you have to catch it so you guys have to play something to do your attention play with it settle with it open get, more room so it can unfold more clearly whichever piece it is, try to get clear on which piece is presenting they want to confuse itself with the character see they, overlay so it gets a little tricky but for the little practice you can tell the difference between a space presentation or a self-presentative presentation or a character presentation or a character presentation they really even though they overlay uh well it's a little practice hanging out it clarifies it's, experienced they're all experienced for like the word yeah character and qualities I've always Associated the qualities that make up the character and that character is able to shift very quickly too okay another big piece here uh best I can catch at the moment uh in the origin of creation you as a free spirit Soul whatever his name is okay we each chose out of the qualities that were there okay certain I, call them colors just to make it looks like we chose our own color scheme okay and we've pretty much been following that color scheme since that time all along the way uh some lives I may want to uh project more of my greenness another life I might want to project more of my bluedness another whatever, and your shades of those colors are different than somebody else who has a similar colors yes but the shading could be different you could be a forest green but your Guru is a lime green uh so you really can't feel exactly what he's feeling because you're a forest green but you can kind of relate to them all he's kind of green and oh I'm interested in him I like him uh but we're so individual and that's good it's you it's called you appreciate you it seems that once the system is open the different qualities will come in that may be surprising like where did that come from how do you know character yeah, yeah through the years I've been surprised when a certain quality shows or a certain capability where'd that come from so I found out early should be very clear I didn't really know who I was I left it open it'd be like today I'm Bobby the warrior or something you know but that doesn't mean I'm going to be that forever I, don't know who I am I don't know the more that's here knowing if I continue the work that I was doing uh that more would unfold and surprise me again probably so yes to be surprised it's good in fact I was considered it a good honesty Factor because you weren't controlling everyone this is what I'm going to be and, uh you're open and suddenly there it is in a holy where'd that come from or I didn't know I had that, sense or that capability or something yeah so following that's fine those qualities are the colors of that further character development as well yeah and the colors get in the domain they're even clearer in the Manifest world the linear uh they're there of course but they're I don't know what could I come they're all murky could I say [Music] yeah, in the domain they're going to show much clearer that's where the archetypes kick in, because they're, they're coloring dude one of my archetypes is a Buddha okay now it doesn't mean I'm supposed to study Buddha or Buddhism no way it's Maya it's me it's my archetype, and as I sit with the Buddha sense oh I enjoyed the uh calmness a lot of calmness there that I get and wisdom a lot of wisdom there and just to hang out calm wisdom, calmness me hanging out not oh the Buddha the Buddha over there and I've got to study the boot over this is you this is Europe your colors okay uh did I say that okay uh and there'll be other others I think my wild guess here is we probably have at least four major archetypes [Music], uh I'm still working on Mine by the way I'm just uh art Texas sort of a new approach sort of are they getting clearer with it is another archetype is a clear uh the glass man I spotted him some years back I forget how but something kind of glassy okay uh and now as I play and, and get into a better level and allow him to take the stage uh Clarity he's got Clarity on how things work uh and sister found a class man Clarity uh and I forget what else Clarity and something else uh and I've got the warrior character and I'm going to be a little slow on the edge you can imagine on the love aspect it'll take me a little bit to get the flavor of not my first grab it uh but he's it's, there it's just the way it shows is not just loving or Jennifer, anyway blah, blah so we will get into archetypes especially as we make an approach is that the right word uh move into if you would the domain uh archetype will come up heavy duty there because they should be experienced to get those finer qualities that are there and a better sense of uh of character at that level a character goes back pretty far I think people drop it along the way because they get into finer sensing awareness of things which kind of like there's no body no, there's still a, finer sense I have nothing to call an archetype body a body it's not a body but it's a body it's, feeling itself it's a it's aware of itself and it's feeling itself it's present with itself and the word stand the words which get very hard to use words we're going to be in a domain here soon try to talk to people in the Manifest world Jesus it's, the language is shifting and God knows what it's going to be like in the Divine world trying to talk to the people who are in a one by one or two by two or whatever it's, not easy or since they had a of a time never could really get that perfect it's, not something you can do perfectly it's just the way it works where are we got me going on a tangent there Mike from New Zealand sensei who said I lost Mike, from New Zealand okay not Mark not Mark Mike yes I was just um I hadn't picked it up when I originally saw this um diagram but for me tonight the, one by two by three by squares feel like the representation of the physical developments of techniques people working on their techniques getting them better and better and finer and finer yeah and then at some point something happens where there's the squares well I don't know whether it's that the walls fall down or whatever but you realize that, I realize that, isn't that's not all that's there yeah, and then it's, the moving out towards this it's a change okay, this is not the right phrase people but it's, suddenly a change a different way of doing things right there again oh since it would say to me uh more original this is refining a finer and finer and finer, those finer and finer and finer but there's a point where it's like whoa wait a minute wait a minute just there's something else going on here and that's about the same time the self ought to be showing itself more because you're at that level and that starts or maybe for a lot of people be the first thing that touches them, there's a self that can sense of self there right around in there property means we've hit the right location so to speak we're balanced enough through the harmony within the Manifest linear setup ah, where we're going to change tracks not the right phrase again but I like the phrase more original it's, it has a little different sense to it I don't know if I said that well we're just saying the same thing again Mike back to you, know that, yes that sounds exactly right I was just visualizing as you was talking that in fact as you go from one byte to two by to three by the four by whatever maybe if you're if you're yeah uh oh God what's the word um allowing, new perceptions to come in that the walls of each one by two bike gradually get less dense almost maybe but let's not worry about that let's not stay in a linear scene fall down in the linear you're still in the linear, this is the trick people this is the trick people this is the trick we're so used to the linear and have used the linear to develop and then we're going to be at this different, setup here and if we're still linearing no matter oh no more walls or whatever you're still in the linear you're not in the domain practicing domain level practices and, we're all going to bump into a little something like, that that's why I'm looking for words to try to give you a heads up about that but that was a good example thank you Mike yes well and I was also going to say, I used to present ideas like you know it's just all you've got to do is turn a switch flick a switch that's, all it needs um and I would demonstrate how that would work but it would happen over a couple of seconds it would be me gradually improving my posture and all that all that stuff and settling and, feeling more grounded goodbye work right yeah yes yeah um and I used to imagine initially that I could just flick the switch, without any linear process and now most of the time I am actually able to do that and it's genuine it's, it's going from one state to another uh could we say if I'm hearing you that, I'm looking for a word when we stop linear Improvement and start to get involved with more original that we could call that flipper switch yes yeah into uh I don't know what to call it again say I need time to figure out these words about this to change direction that, is not the right word I know for the fact that it's, the trouble is it's actually Beyond any of the regular words people and that's why it's a it's a because I guess it almost sounds like the words that we're trying to use are all coming from the linear perspective yeah, so we do the best we can we Mumble along they're going to miss us and whatever uh what can you do just do the best you can try to improve you know your layout uh I, like to switch words around uh so people don't get stuck on one word especially with a misunderstanding of that switch door around let's try this word for the same thing this FL this flavor for the same thing whatever there's a, cool a cool bunch of words that really strike her home um you know you're talking about like a, shift and it's almost a dimension and I think of that as like uh arithmetic to like geometric and it locked me on those I'll never use those words I know so, don't know what they mean okay so, bear with me so here you go so it's like it's going from like um being like a, linear to something that's non-linear linear to something that's non-linear which is harmonic which is um I don't know uh arithmetic, [Music], rhythmic to arithmetic so a rhythm those are probably beautiful words if you're in that crowd use them with that proud I'm not going to use them because I don't understand them and I don't know if my troops will understand him you know that you've got that group go for it it's yo but you had Tasia who was so great at doing harmonics and those are like great like, words that could be used in your presentation I think those are great words the words good the words that you just said I could use oh yeah I don't understand them I have no feelings for them so no I can't use them I, haven't experienced that, yeah I'm not in that zone yeah Harmony When water talks to me starts talking I'm steiny and I say Jesus yeah you're wasting your time or he goes words he's like talking basketball Jesus I really don't know anything don't talk to me in those terms that should be a bit better yeah I'm gonna use einsteinian I'm not a nice dining devotee to me I go blank huh I'm gonna experience the universe my way and in hopefully a simple form that I can present simply to other people so, the rhythm is sort of like you know like that okay you're doing a water Army you're going to try to explain rhythm no and Jack comes back at me trying to explain uh, uh okay that guy gotcha, okay thank you yeah get together with the musicians and you guys can sit around and talk and the dimensionality of Rhythm feel free feel free okay thank you, need to go there myself but you're free too I'm not saying don't think you hang out with it you soak in it you do hopefully finer dimensions on that lineage could we call it our Harmony harmonics you experience it and then you can lay it out better and better and you can manifest certain things better and better go for it I'm not boxing you people into any one thing I hope okay I happen to be an aikidos martial artist uh, uh if some of you are not aikidos no problem no Pro you don't have to be you don't have to be a fighter uh that's fine you're a musician you're a lover or whatever you're a paraplegic or what hey whatever okay so that's sort of where I'm coming from if I made any sense ah it's Mike again um I, just wanted to say there was one word that he came up with which I thought was really good and that was the word shift word shift as opposed to change I thought shift was a yeah it's not a word of I mean it's a common word but it just gives it to me it's got more of the feeling of now for me at the moment shift sounds like a, movement off to the side for me I'm talking me now it's not like I'm moving off to the side to zoom, I, like that sense of it I like the sense of the curtain's closing and the next what do you call it scenery on the stage what's that called the next the next Autumn you here the next steam the next scene the next scene yeah the next scene, the next scene yeah the next scene is there fully uh so shift is an okay word but for me I, won't use it for me because I get this urge to shift so being bang does it for me if you like the word shift hey if that does it for you fine just make sure you're not shifting off to the side if you're not hey I got no problem with you using that word, yeah well maybe, the right words are bing bang maybe that's the maybe that's the term that's needed since I just want to come to Mike's defense here I use the word shift sometimes too and I use it in the sense of uh because it's my vocabulary uh phase shift so water changes to ice all of a sudden and water changes to steam all of a sudden it's water and then it's Steam it's water and then it's ice and it's so distinct that it's like this change of dimensionality or whatever we want to call it so I, I'm I think that sometimes it's a good word for this so you like okay uh yeah whatever ah you're really pretty free in this game only time I will go eh is if I think you're getting off Target but if you're on target I don't give a what words you use I don't give a if you're in a dojo or a band or a hospital or a cat house for God's sakes why don't you do it right so that's your own time I'll start to if I think you're getting lost in there someplace you know but as to what you do and who you are that's you that's you yeah you want to be a golfer instead of a tennis player hey I'm not going to say no, golfing is better uh no, way it's you it's you yeah so in settling with yourself at first a lot of misunderstandings because there'll be some, people don't like themselves let's say they're, afraid of themselves I've seen a lot of that they won't settle and open because they're afraid of what's going on it's like hey it's you it's you it's just stuff no one's explained to you oh those are your energies those are your nutrients from the pot you're in they're healthy they're great if you hang out easy and don't freak out and don't run don't make up stories hopefully you'll actually experience oh this is nice wow, it's yours you with your stuff no don't be afraid of your stuff and finer and fire and finer it is finer, and fire and finer it is finer, finer okay yeah Justin I see your face you got anything to say here did you see my eyes burning into the camera, um I, do actually I do thank you so um so there was a couple of things that I'd, like to drill into going forward one is through the experience of dimensionality character leading to a more available self in the space with its own aliveness one hand remaining Vigilant and consistently available during the during the, day or what's happening within that I say right there open to open two yeah open to the aliveness that's uh available from a radiant core self within a certain space but Vigilant remaining available at a certain level of openness aliveness one thing vigilance consistence consistency second thing is distant second made but maybe is a sense of lineage or Mission that's being explored within the space that self is presenting his aliveness in too I don't know if I said that well but um yeah you can charge out here at Penthouse I got a little bit lost um lineage uh I, think a major lineage or maybe the major is who are you in the fullness of that you who are you now oh I mean think about it oh I'm, I'm not though the Aikido teacher not I don't mean that level who are you really before you were the you that you think you are who were you all those kinds of things were just finer I call it backtracking finer backtracking into the truth of ourselves the reality of ourselves, okay and the different pieces that constitute a properness the character the self the construct and maybe using the space again I want to want to work on that some more uh the space as a as a helpful piece in more space everything can unfold better the self can the character cat the construct of creation can uh so I think we're just trying to backtrack ourselves uh, is really the main thing it's yeah I don't know if I said anything intelligent there yes I'm sure if you said anything okay I don't know thank you oh God oh God Susie you on say something intelligent here she's here since it but she's muted just stand by yes sensei I will say something intelligent help us out here [Music] no the main question would people help you think we're missing anything, it's not clear for you where would you like to head where do you want to go foreign Justin doesn't mind coming back on and um, Justin, oh Justin okay go back on Justice just going a little bit more Justin on um self and I believe you talked about fish ing [Music] go ahead go ahead so Justin Susan is asking you to speak more, about self and Mission that you mentioned a moment ago oh so um in, my experience limited as it may be I um experienced as a self within a certain space a level of, radiant aliveness self and it, and it, in invites the, sense of, lineage or mission of, self within this life um, and how to remain consistently sort of on, track there on point and stay vigilant in a way so as to continue allowing the aliveness of self Within this the space and um again be vigilant whereas a the character only isn't taking over with its own identity ego or agenda of thoughts feelings that um that limit the aliveness of self to radiate or show again more words sorry but okay are you finished or could I jump in for a sec yeah please save me okay you presented the a little bit the negative sense the self is really cool and whatever but the character will do that stuff to it okay and does it really have to be yeah, yeah, but does it really have to be that way self radiates through the character and the character picked that up and gets a little clearer it's character More Alive because of this inner Source glow whatever so can't the character be an accord does it have to be negative that way now we know if I wake up tomorrow morning and I'm a Bobby we got a lot of negative so I've got to do my process really quick or whatever to get out of that but, should it be so that the character is the bad guy here in itself is the good guy no not at all I, I, feel that um this is largely a function of how much space is available um accessible to self and um and how much information or, or qualities dynamic or mixing within the space, uh is a level of aliveness self available at that level to occupy or work within that space or should a finer degree of self be manifest to function well maybe um as a self not open allowing whatever could be more functional self to operate well in a certain space okay I don't know uh and not correct me if I say this wrong um talk about self but then you talk about functioning uh self maybe self radiating through the character, and the character functions because self is there potentially keeping this the character in an upgraded level okay and either the character or the self phase and I know I gotta click in again here but a finer glowing self let's say enlivens the character to move better speak better do whatever character has to do in his world and that glow also is more than just character it's character in his world and in his world of character it has a bigger spread than just uh my nose so you know this bigger spread kind of thing so I'm not saying anything you said was wrong I was just trying to say something where the hell are we if we're gonna talk I need you in the front yard front yard he visits me now and then we sit in the front yeah uh where are we people are you are you finished uh who started this Susan started it Susan you started this come on what'd you get out of this well thank you thank you Justin um I think it gets at something that came up for me a couple weeks ago when you were doing the self uh identity to self-progression where I felt that he, have a responsibility or there's a desire of self to continue developing and you know with what you're presenting tonight with that balance of character self-construct and particularly space that ability to develop um develop it happens better happens more easily with that balance of all of those pieces that makes sense or people are having a strong, desire there's a strong desire at least I felt um at a particular level of self there's a really strong desire and I would say even a sense of responsibility to keep developing Sensei I think that Susan is getting at the fact that as for me as the self radiates through the character, its natural tendency is to want to develop more develop itself more itself yeah, and back and forth yeah, so there's that reciprocophity reciprocity yes and to even increase there is uh, that was mentioned uh maybe, you're making the, uh, each one is trying to assist or work and replace each other they reinforce each other or resonate maybe as a good word yeah, uh they build and help each other yeah, yeah but and Susan's I think Susan's trying to say that that's the natural tendency of the self if we allow it is to want to be developed more yeah, sort of want to develop itself more yeah uh yeah for those who have any trouble hearing her she's way up in the mountain Boonies so uh I was going to do a, fun kind of exercise an oldie but a good thing I was going to add to it but we ate up most of our time with this great discussion maybe, you could end with it since it no it's a little bit longer than the time allotted so I might um might do it next week let's see, [Music], so people it's your last chance where are we going where do you want to go anything into not understood on so far those main pieces character self construct, and spaces jumping and again I got to spend some time with space see how it wants to fit in with all of this uh foreign nothing you all got a down pat you don't need me screw you I think the thing is Sensei it's a it's a journey but it's a non-linear journey and we don't have a destination that we're heading or at least if we do have a destination then we're limiting the journey but I always often more often visualize kind of like the yellow brick road but you can only see a little bit of it in front of you at any moment in time and then you know you get another little um well from your teachings and presenting information and stuff a little bit more another, flagstone becomes visible in front of you and you can walk forward and then so you don't get to see the whole path you only get to see a little bit in front of you and there's an element of trust in being prepared to keep walking forward and knowing that there will be more that will become visible or we say let it unfold it wants to it's there to and that's again a damn space kicking in and strong in more space it has more room to unfold truer and more properly some more space in turns a finer level where everything can unfold whether it's the self or the character or the construct, boom it wants to okay well I think all we basically have to do is make ourselves available ants that are keeping this from unfolding then I think we got to take care of those a bit uh, but basically I think there's a Simplicity and it's there wants to show itself settling scene for help opening seems to help, breathing seems to help I'm getting a sense of Letting Go seems to help so all those things a little partial tricks that help that, that's there to unfold and show itself to be experienced not just aware of to be also experienced, so there so maybe that is a Simplicity Factor it wants to it's there yeah but if I'm in a one by one the theirness of it doesn't do anything for me I'm a one by one what a shame because wow even keeping it simple there's a three by three there all I have to do is stop hanging on to this one by one and believe it's the only truth only truth and let go of my tensions I'm hanging on to the one by one is easy, you know what happens pretty quickly it's a three by three and B there and you'll begin to feel yourself in the three by three and that's not bobbing anymore, and things get clearer and it's not a bad day anymore it's a fair day ah and on and on and on but again that first introduction like Words nicer is there but if I'm hanging on to and did that it can't show and a lot of people these days are getting Tighter and Tighter with the politics and the whatever and the way they're getting tighter they like this for some reason but don't they catch it doing themselves a disservice because that, is nicer can't show in their system in their system in their system but you have to be careful though the beat of tightening is very strong uh but it seems to me Sensei that that's also very much around at one level feeling safe you know you've got your nice little walls yeah it feels safe that's why it could be a major here I have to really fine tune with, it space may be a good word that we should use a more often more space more original space because everything else has room to show itself in the more space so yeah so yeah and I also think as part of that being willing to allow those barriers to drop and go into a larger space you need a certain amount of trust because you don't know what's in that space between the one by one and the two by two you know you can't teach your loves that word huh yarn uh Trust that word that word I think teacher may have uh ducked out since Susan uses the word a lot and you use the word a lot and yeah, I think it's I think that's an important piece as well yeah but it's certainly how dumb do you have to be you learn a simple way of moving from your body to your Robert and it's like whoa this is much better and you do it again and you're Suddenly at you're not oh this is pretty cool how much whatever does it take to say oh the next one's going to be horrible it's going to be worse it's going to eat me up, I I've had three in a row should follow the pattern is that called Trust, I don't know what the opposite of that would be called excuse me I'm a little hard pure stupidity well I think in society generally trust is a foreign commodity that people are very unwilling to um rely on because of well um, yeah and we could get into what's keeping people from developing and getting to all kinds of things and I don't feel like doing that right, now and that's sort of where we're heading I don't want to go, there I, have to deal with that a lot in doing my work here I want to lay this out now where are they going to screw it up how are they going to misunderstand it uh but I don't want a major, in there because I'll end up in kindergarten level and I've I'll never get out of kindergarten level yeah absolutely keep training me I've got to keep developing not develop is that the right word keep being more aware of me and how it works in the finder and finer more original of me Sensei this is this is Tom I'm, not on video tonight and I came in a little late so I apologize but I can't help but um, think now about getting beyond the tight space, and, going back to this your presentation of sound and the chanting that you introduced again that opens us up and creates a place for character to develop and, I just think that think that you know the words get complicated we get weary down and weighted down in the wording but sound has such a pure clear quality and helps us to understand our qualities our personal qualities our individual qualities so I, love that you have introduced us to, How Sound Works I've had a couple of glasses of wine so my wording is not so unclear as it normally is I think it's better Tom I think you caught on to a secret how many glasses uh two by now to eight o'clock so it's past my wine time I'm, I'm in it now more than two minutes me and Brad are gonna do our wine time here oh God bless you oh thank you Tom yeah vibration uh, chanting yeah I, really liked it when I majored in it uh it's coming back around a little bit again oh since they really like chanting uh, it's uh harmonics back to uh, whoever Sean harmonics uh yeah just don't forget the pieces that in harmony Who Are You Now who are you character or who are you self and at that level of Harmony anything else about the construct of creation that may want to show uh so, that's a nice serve form there are other forms but that's a nice one, not the only one but a nice one yeah, I think everyone could touch on it a little bit and if you really like it spend more time with it okay yeah okay we're finishing we're finishing thank you so much Sensei thank you and uh thank you everyone for staying with us till eight o'clock it's almost eight straight up make the announcements again please once again announce that we've now posted uh the video recordings from the October 28th and November 4th sessions they're up on the moon Sensei Channel on YouTube and also there will be no class on Friday November 25th the Friday after Thanksgiving thank you so much sensei okay

okay hi, thank you for being here tonight uh a lot tonight uh, I hope we don't screw it up too badly let's give it a shot, uh so the big four represent uh four main pieces of creation could be safe that way, uh, the space itself the self it's present the character that is present even finer environment whatever uh more uh original the I use the word construct for a while uh the design is also a very good word here the design of creation uh, okay, the Big Four uh hopefully having a week an extra week off uh you 'll be nice if you would spend some time uh and major in the one that catches your attention for example uh, last week Lauren was asking me to get more into the character and the archive uh finder and finer character with archetype and that could I call it lineage that lineage character Bobby Robert Nado saying and more original than that more original than that okay and the combinations later are better self a better character squaring away better would have the right words for squaring the way I uh facilitates more of the self showing okay, so anyway where the hell are we space itself, character, design of creation but um I'm sorry say are you soliciting comments, yeah when I shut up for more than a moment I'm soliciting so I have a question here um this is Tasia oh okay uh yes sir we've been we've been talking about, things that are sequential things that are sequential things that are linear and in some ways then referring also the things that are non-linear yeah when you lay out the big four like this I imagine that it's both linear and non-linear but do you see that in a design uh I mean you see the design and a sequence this is just a different angle um the D no I'm sorry not, that one thing no to D yet okay, Kitty, that's an overlaid presentation I thought I'd throw this one at you this is a different angle on it so okay let me go over this there's an original creation and it and it the finest let's say whatever word the finest, and as it continues it goes into let's find, or if it's defined its vibrations it goes into a little heavier vibration continues heavier vibrations heavier vibrations and here we are in this heavy matter world heavy body heavy pressure stuff like that okay so how I configured that excuse my drawing kacho wasn't here earlier uh so let's starting here at this tighter place of manifest okay now in the Manifest we can upgrade Bobby to Robert a one by two or two by a bad day to a fair day uh, the millionaire can, upgrade and, get to a point where he's a billionaire the athlete can get faster and stronger or what whatever we can upgrade okay, so far now what we're trying to do here is saying wait a minute there's enough, is enough or good enough is good enough so I arbitrarily for me I like the sense of at least a three by three level or a not dough level, or a not dough level okay or a good day level that a certain amount of presence in the what teach is calling linear we also call that the linear the Manifest linear world okay and when you get to enough which I call it balance level not just the idea but also the experience, of that level okay you have an opportunity oh Sensei right here said uh okay we'll go from finer and finer and then we can make a move to more original so this is my attempt to map that out we can make a move from finer and finer and finer and finer which he inferred goes on and on and on finer to find her to find her to find her uh it really goes on a long time per a long way but we can cut short on that once you get the sense of it and need some experience of it Bobby to Robert Donato you're getting some experience uh someplace along the way it's good enough now we start to head towards more original and we're heading towards the domain uh originally uh was called hidden by El Sensei domain for me and for uh seems to lay it out a bit better, we could say this is a whole world of manifest now here's a whole world of domain, very fancy place a lot can go on here so if our one two three four if we have some experiences one two three four there's no reason you can't then start to shift out of a finer to finer to finer form to uh, a more original and then eventually don't worry about it now but eventually if you really get pretty good here you can move into the heavenly, okay, so we're heading towards more original more original more original in the Manifest in Bobby's World Robert's World our world uh some degree of, getting a sense of the dimensionality of the Improvement of the character of the more room that's there uh of the finer vibrations that exist uh you're better the world around you seems to be better seems to be a mutual relationship support good we may have enough right there to say okay enough of that style now we're going to uh head towards or bring in the word more original okay more original and here's where the domain now we're making a move from, the Manifest towards and into domain level by drawing it out it may give you a little different angle on, the overlay to manifest the domain world and the Divine world they're all fully there overly but I thought that angle on it might give you a little different take yeah that's helping that's just helping to get a little more clarity around that because it is I think what you're saying is it's both the, linearity is in certain parts and then the non-linearity is in is in other dimensions maybe, we could say that the flavor of the development of the linear Bobby Robert not outside uh the flavor of it continues when I for lack of words I have a good word here shift to more original, yeah so yeah there'll be a lot of carry over there uh I, don't know how to say it any better sorry no you can't do you can't develop in the linear way into that space right I mean we're apparently not apparently it's really big, you can go on and on and on and on uh it's just finer to finer to finer to finer and, still not get to the underlying major that's a, major move to the domain that's there and the words people damn the words or are we here Tisha yeah that's good that's good it's just it's so interesting to reflect on how, we can make the effort in the linear way you get some sense of progress so you think in order to go further you have to you have to work I'm a billionaire I've got to be a multi-billionaire yeah and then I have to be a multi, multi-billionaire whatever yeah that yes, yes now is that not enough aren't you sort of getting more screwed away can we not do more original style yes that's right yeah and that's why we bring a, heavier example now it's a heavy example but somebody who's a great swordsman he's the best for years he's the best of the generation and some place along the way The Story Goes he goes ah eh I don't feel like trying to get better, okay, my, greatness is more than good enough and he stops worrying about this I can think of it as a left to right development uh, hello uh hello uh and, and then the question Who Am I the self is starting to hey you got enough of this what about this piece the self-piece then they often go off to a monastery or go live in a cave because they're questioning something a finer inner as opposed to developing more this, where it probably was some degree of inner work to be the great swordsman but really on a major in it or do a Quantum Leap possibility okay more towards more original and that's where the word or designation that we're using the domain so more repetition uh more repetition of the same thing you know you got to be a great swordsman by doing a Thousand Cuts a day and by the way you know that's by the way oh since they brought that one up yeah he said to swing three thousand times all you're going to do is tear your shoulders up and park your spine he says you know o senses I could do it in one or two swings that's so Sensei but he's, still pointing out a direction enough of this well again this change of Direction bad crazy but this let's head towards more original more original, more original so all my training heretofore let's say has been finer and finer that's a Bobby Robert not though set up kind of thing now let's head towards more original best I can say it yeah, and I think that for a lot of people in our Friday night group are sort of ready for more original so I think you've done a fair good job hopefully a fair good job in your linear work of you know catching the pieces of the linear there's a body character Bobby Robert Noto oh there's more room and more room seems to facilitate a robber showing better or Ronaldo showing better so we need a little room or space okay then we find out after a bit uh there's a sense of something self-inner that people start to pick out because something you're called self that's different than Robert but it's me itself as I think when, self is starting to show it's a damn good clue that you have an opportunity here to do this but again I don't know what the cause is potentially faster form or more direct heading towards original ah how are we doing here ninja back to you no I think that's good um, and I, just want to sympathize with the language and how, difficult it is to uh, to kind of uh pinpoint these more subtle and refined uh, when we're talking about moving from linearity to non-linearity linearity to non-linearity we're still using the linear mind to try to figure that out or try to so you have to let go you really do have to let go yeah in order to feel that in order to experience it because yes, yeah, so the more space can facilitate that in fact I kind of like this the wording more original it's almost like for me it's almost like a kind of a magic word okay, yeah I gotta settle and sit and square away a little bit yes, yes linear now more original more original so I kind of like that phrasing I like it more original it's also always Sensei phrase but phrase but uh but I, like the flavor of it that's something little something for, me but again I think historically throughout the centuries this difficulty of being at a, much finer level than normal people trying to explain how that level you're in works in works that this has always been a problem well since I said oh my God what a problem it always was and always will be a problem so we throw it out uh knowing a lot of people are going to get you know try to figure out these things in their linear modality and it has to be experienced so the sense of more room experiencing and then using the four as a tracking mechanism could I say so again Lauren was interested in, character and archetype okay kind of a lineage the character lineage okay goes on for a long time it doesn't stop at uh, once you get into finer energy vibrations where you're sort of past the body it doesn't stop there there's still a body not this body but a body so when we clarify that a bit we'll try to map it uh with some of the body words TJ help me we've talked about this uh a chakra body okay yeah I was referring to uh I was referring to what's often known in the literature is subtle body is what it is and the subtle body will be any of the dimensions so you're talking about chakra body we could talk about the from the Chinese point of view it's the danteans uh Japanese we talk about the Hara as a as an energetic field and you're laying out Center Line center field as a cohesive consilient peace and with the sense that body continues and the archetype bodies are getting very Advanced they really come up strong when you're hitting it towards or in domain now I'm, thinking of archetype bodies as an experiential level I'm not talking about you read it in your psychology book because young said so and you go yeah, I understand I'm not talking about that about that body or that knowledge about that body I'm talking about the experienced body that is kind of similar to you experiencing actually that there's a body that's very alive that's this body okay uh so maybe we'll map that out a little bit uh so I'll bounce back with t-shirt and get some of the Oriental words a subtle body and there's another one or two there that will sort of throw in no big deal uh you don't have to spend generations of your life with one level body here uh things can move very fast especially when we start this pattern going ah he's your help I don't know no that's good that's good there there's uh you know we talk about the astral body we talk about the you know the channels and the meridians and the ancient yogis had their ways of speaking about it and they talked about what's called the nadis which is their kind of view of the subtle energy channels yes okay now for me yeah you want to get into a big discussion there but for me energy flow things are fairly early it's in the energy body level so I want to continue with more the subtle body that's finer and moves along and whatever other words other people use or even finer than that so yeah what I appreciate you, saying and you know it's in a way how you how you guide us is you give us the practice so that we can directly connect with the experience and then afterwards you can start to put some language to it uh but, it begins with practice moving into experience yeah, so that's why you're that's a one by two by three by or any of the any of the ways that we um that we connect with it we, move more into, experience and that's the same way really the skillful way in working with subtle channels is don't say well this is your Chiang Mai and this is your Chiang Mai and this is your you know this is the microcosmic orbit or something and then you're just stuck in your head about what that is yeah, yeah so a major with all of this is have some distinction between the awareness or teacher call it stuck in your head the awareness of it okay yes there's no problem with that it's when you think your awareness is everything and there's another hole especially under half of it the experience of it and then the continuing finer experience sensing finer experience sensing, sensing finer experience sensing, finer, so again the uh, it's not on my illustrate no I don't think but uh thinking, feeling, finer feeling sensing finer sensing that that's important in all of this work so we don't just become intellectuals about it his mother if I could uh interject sure oh yes please, all right so I'll just add all the help I can get tonight well I'm, uh appreciating tonight's new diagram uh this one you like that one I, do I do um, because, um, to me it uh ties also to your what you've been talking about with the vortex of creation yeah right and so apparently that's a vortex, well okay yeah so that's actually what I wanted to talk about so you've drawn it as if it's three circles but my understanding it's more of a like a, gradient transition that the, hidden domain is kind of the, area between Heavenly and manifest we can't really see it we have to really open to it and sense finer yes go ahead and that once we sort of open ourselves to The Hidden then it's possible to sort of from time to time perhaps access the heavenly but it could show through yeah it could show True see even in the physical uh we've had moments where something has flashed through the old Aikido story was a example of old grandmother walked into the garage her grandson is pinned under the car the Jack broke or something and she picks the damn thing up right yeah or when I that's just a story I, don't know where it came from uh but what I read about was a guy truck driver I guess and Carr got into uh near him got into an accident it was on fire the guy was inside cards on fire and he ripped the door off and he later said I can never do that again what happened in that moment that he was able to rip the door off that something flashes through uh right, right, so yes there are flash throws, okay now what I'd like people to do is if they get a flash through and say wow I had this amazing experience yeah it's beautiful now good at you backtrack it and try to exist at least for a while in the level or yeah the size space the level whatever it came from it caught your attention, right, now if you're really interested to say hmm what's the more earlier origin of that how is that allowed to work now let me think about that well let's see they were stressed and they uh no, no, no, no, the actual experience of that can be replayed or you can use the memory of that to replay yeah going over the cliff in his car and all a bunch of stuff happened that Jack didn't do we all know Jack, didn't, do we all know Jack, didn't do this but shrooms things got taken care of they were just happening that was a flash through okay, yeah go ahead please so when you when you when you have described uh the vortex of creation moving from finer energy to denser and denser and uh matter manifest and then but then to sort of open ourselves out of that we need to spiral back the other way it seems yeah but I don't have to spiral uh see I, agree a spiral I understand it's spiraling it's like diagram edges that way but I don't feel a spiral per se no, no yeah I can feel heavier forms of it if I stand in check I say oh it's spiraling this way strong today but not this way so there's up and down different directions of spiral that I can sort of pick up as strong as it pushes it pulls we could say yes if you settle the results that should be equal to the push into Tighter and Tighter so setting an opening go if the if the vortex creation is towards denser and denser the practice is the vortex of opening of finer and finer and so I find it you know maybe that happens in our Center and that's why we practice but there's this these two Dynamics simultaneously right if we are truly in our practice then we are trying to move ourselves we are allowing ourselves to sense the hidden Dimension more than the Manifest and yet the tendency in the universe is towards, you know denser and denser and, here you've told us night after night yeah reach for the finer yeah which enough uh yeah I, think we've pointed out very clearly that Bobby then there's weird Bobby and I have my mental illness and you all do too all I have to do is Buck you in tight enough okay and we all got a little really weird, that's you getting into a tighter in a smaller space my body slumps a bit my tummy pulls in a bit right in a larger space I tend to stretch I tend to begin to breathe better I tend to feel a little more power supporting my back as I settle more tend to feel more present and a fuller uh energy sense through my whole body sort of Basics so you gotta wreck and what I've tried to have you do people is recognize when you that the soft push I put you in a wind tunnel and I said let's see if you can't pick up playing the game I mean pick up this beginning of a push before it pushes into your weirdness or tightness or whatever, uh to try to pick it up a little earlier not wait you're pushed and pushed and pushed and then it's kind of hard work you're in a very tight little harder to move up out of that you're an insane asylum it's so hard to Sonny's I think I'll settle open and move along dimensionally uh so to try to get a feeling of, that push and easy settle to feel things opening there opening there we could call that a calling easy as you get finer sense you can feel that, pull is not a good word but that, direction draw okay damn the word but go ahead uh no thank you Sensei is that, it wish, people let's hear what you got to say here, hi it's Mike from New Zealand mate um well it seems to me that, our Material World Only Knows one way of progressing and that is the linear pattern there is there is no alternative you as you train you can lift higher weights you can do faster times in a library yep that's how you measure your progress whereas what, you're making abundantly clear is these moments when we are able to do something that is outside our normal capabilities are the real things we should be noticing and when we're teaching and we see our students do that, when they do something that's way beyond their normal that those are the moments that we need to get people to capture and not to get hooked on but to notice and then you know when it happens another time to tell them look when it happens again and it will it will spend a little bit of time in that space after it's happening feeling that space experience sounds great, with you there mate uh historically uh, if I saw, a newer type on the map uh perform a technique Way Beyond the skill level I immediately would go over and okay for him to feel where he's coming from, finally what you just said because he was coming from a place that wasn't normal he was outstanding in that move whoa let me let me feel that and see if I can sense feel the level he's coming from how that works so I would definitely go okay and that's, that's good advice yeah um because I think what actually happens in our in our physical world is that we either ignore or make little of those experiences yeah we've got some real heavy some real monster eight type yeah, I can't touch it they don't believe it they're kind of heavy the courts I can't feel it because they haven't settled into a finer level of feeling right, it's amazing how many people you must have run into it in the dojo where you say feel and, they don't have any concept of feeling they don't really even know what that means feel your body New York I know I have a body what, is feeling the body are absolutely yeah absolutely and I I've got to say I'm still putting my hand up and supporting the word shift I think the word shift and I don't think of it in your terms of moving to the side you like that word yep for you yay leave me alone live with me with your word I'll live with mine as long as we're progressing yes then fine that word is helping you progress, okay, so anyway yeah somebody, here we are please peace since uh Danny here Danny there Jenny yeah um, but just recalling um a workshop that you did in New Zealand I think you were out with Amy so it's a good while ago and we've done a three-day seminar and we were in our Dojo so everyone present was pretty primed if you know what I mean we we've been working with you for a few days and, we continued working with it and you came to a point and you said we're going to dip our toes into the land of Harmony you use that word the land of Harmony it stayed with me and um and even your pose as you dip your toes into it you said easy, the land of Harmony and I've used those words that, like you with the original Self they feel really powerful to me we are by it seems to invoke a feeling of expansion in my body yeah and um and calms me um and I've used the expression With Friends saying look this in the land of Harmony such and such wouldn't happen and they've given me a hard time but I, enjoy it creates wonderful conversation but the feeling Within Myself is very powerful yeah and so yeah would you like and I'll have a question yeah where were we entering the domain or were we already there don't know don't know, uh he was very cool yeah as you guys play you'll know when you're entering the domain things will get a bit different but uh let's hold that one off for, a bit oh okay, yeah geez Sensei I, was really quiet the other day and I was able to hold my quietness for five minutes was I in a domain I don't know I don't know let's not go crazy here okay yeah, all I can say is when you're more fully experiencing that level you'll kind of know it's that level something or other you'll kind of know that's all I can say all right but I'm not going to try that well he was quiet for five minutes maybe he was in the domain he pulled off a hell of a throw he must have been in a domain I've gone there I ain't going there, I'll, clarify that I don't know foreign in more room in the design of creation it's a finer dimension, and one possibility in a finer Dimension more room is the land of Harmony and now, we should be feeling finer feeling sense feeling and you go oh yeah I can really experience that so we say that naturally happened with that now telling that to somebody else who isn't going to have a sense of a little more room or a sense of feeling finer feeling a sense of some vibrations that in harmony at a certain level um Harmony can't show okay so the vibrations have to be such to produce that particular quality so that's why you could experience it but you couldn't tell them to unless they play a little bit with it can I say that, good enough yeah thank you very much okay so I think in teaching uh Danny one, thing is if you're going to help bring people this other levels and other qualities and stuff like that, you we you we have to walk that path ourselves and get some experience there potentially then we can help them move along because oh there you've been uh you've done the first trick you've been to scout what other words have used to scout the, Pathfinder the path breaker uh you've, gone through the brambles and the and the whatevers to get there and you know some of the tricks some of the problems and some of the problems and some of the insights you get with those problems to make it simpler and then because you actually yourself have trekked this experience this and makes it easier to potentially help somebody else to walk that same path have a similar experience or the experience they should have at that level Okay so uh so just telling somebody intellectually it's really uh, harmonious it's really uh lovely uh, you do with that they look around they see and you're telling them it's lovely uh they have to have some, Journey some sense of how to get there and that's all I've been laying out over and over again I think thank you thank you thank you oh somebody we're already here Emma big layout the big four space we've touched on Space a bit uh The First beginning simple of space is, if Bobby has to settle and open and you'll notice just in that one there's a little flavor of a little more room has room for Robert to character to be there, and in the little more room uh the construct uh whatever it comes strong character design the design the energy uh design of how it works starts to show there uh so that's your first simple introduction to more space it's just a baby introduction but whoa that's an important one if Bobby doesn't have more space it's hard for him to be a Robert easy set up open there's more space and if it's more space actually oh it gets a change already I'm, beginning to want to breathe better I'm beginning to want to adjust and straighten better I want to do that I was urged to do that because in the more space that's easier to do did I say that well I thought I did so space self character and design of creation, Sensei is spaced the same as situation ah at the moment I, I don't think so uh situation situations okay couldn't situation be Martin design of things when there's something there's something else in relationship to it the design maybe but I myself right now can't place it as space but I can place it pretty much with the design yeah um if you're going to major in space don't be too quick this is from oh Sensei don't be too quick to clutter it up with stuff, if you're gonna major in just space more original space finer more original space and just hang out with space beginning to show itself and remember you gotta at first have an idea about it of course for a moment but the more sense experience of the space and sensing with the space itself is sensing uh so uh so if you're going to major in space uh trick of the trade for most since they don't color it up with stuff here too fast don't, do that if the space won't be able to, explain itself explain for like a words it's experience as space okay so let's not be too fast cluttered up, if you're going to major in checking out space yeah see when we did some months a few months back teacher when was that when uh or were you came in from the top and it was beautiful or something remember, we were doing space then yeah we were doing space a few months ago right yes yeah a couple months ago in that case I didn't figure you, all could go into a much, finer original space so I even inferred now it's happening meaning what's starting to go on in this space yeah, but truly the major in space I, wouldn't go too faster now what goes on here, um it's gonna major in space just to get a real good experience with it uh major in space yeah uh this is Tasia um I'm appreciating that you're saying this because the, experience of space is not about the things that arise in space although we can experience them but if you're if you're majoring in space then it's, it's well how to say it it's very spacious and it's not about the things that are arising in it that are present in it if you're going to major in space yeah, and living space more original show itself and for like a word explain itself but you got to be careful because things can start to show you know how the construct work can begin to show a character can begin to be there uh a self might say Here I Am uh you have to what's the word delineate no uh differentiate, yeah or the difference between space itself and what right what is present in space yeah, I mean it's just one way of speaking so I like different pretty close but again come up with your own word people you've got a sense of it differentiate or I'd say uh focus on but people who tend to focus on focus on but people who tend to focus on so I don't like that word a certain way but focus on just space and sometimes if something else starts to show it'd be like I'm having enough trouble with space thank you another time back to space, it's your turn I like the word distinguish it's a good one good distinguished yeah to distinguish yes I heard it got it distinguish okay where are we this is the big time layout here people this is my before a week's break now you got something to spend a couple of weeks with Amy I see your happy face there you got anything to say Shipley all face no words What's Happening Here um I'm trying to turn on my camera um doesn't give me Great Hopes here but go ahead uh no words yet I'm kind of processing it still I'm still, settling in me the big four it's a great way of um categorizing it though just, for fun not so early here but just for fun what's your stand out of what you might choose to major in for a just highlight I'm talking about a week two weeks or whatever just uh get better is there anything that, seems to come at you from one of those oh they all seem so interesting I've actually been working a lot on self yeah self has been something I've been wanting to work on lately but as I was sitting here I was really feeling space and I was like I wanted to just feel the space and things kept coming in and I'm like, let it go let it go so it's like I'm kind of liking I'm kind of liking like well not of yet to choose the first one which would it be I'm kind of liking space because when there's more space the self that's there there's more space the self that's there has more room to show itself at its level or the character with more room can show the better level of character won't show a Bobby I don't know show or Robert or whatever uh and the construct can show clear because otherwise it's a bit of a jumble hot a universe works Jesus you know yeah and it's kind of like space that may be in a very important first word here for me now this week yeah I mean as I was sitting here it was kind of coming up a space and I was Finding how, much either something just enters that space or you put something in that space and so really giving it its moment really feeling just the space and not automatically going to what's in there hey I think we'll be better uh I think I'm finally what you're saying but it doesn't matter okay I, think with more and more practice let's say space is still a good one to start just to say and in more space but you're open to one of the others that we'll be able to hear which one wants center stage in that space that you'll not uh itself self-watch, or character that will be able to hear it feel it sensing that it's going hey I want to turn here I, think if you're saying there's an order into this huh is there an order to this then so it's spaced first and then no I don't want to lock in on this no okay, uh but for first I think the space seems to be very useful because how can we do a character Bobby and he doesn't realize how space is important he got no room to be a Robert, you know or it can't be a big plant he's in a tiny pot you can't get nursed and grow so I kind of I'm kind of this week looking at space as being one of the first things may not be but I this week I'm enjoying that sense of it I'm playing with it hang around that's what I do I research I play and see okay uh but at the this week I like space first, nothing everybody's got to do space for it if you don't do space you're going to end up in hell oh come on but at the moment I like space first it's ah because all the others seem to be able to unfold better in more space yeah, later I'll try some of the others and see how it works but you can interchange or not I'm not a good word interchange uh let's say you're going for majoring in self and more space self and the self feels to be at a nice level however self is experiencing itself then one could say okay by the way I'm very interested in self and character what character is here who am I character at this level of self and then suddenly character can come, in so we can interchange I think a couple weeks ago somebody said oh I didn't know we could interchange like that they ordered it different but I think that's what basically they're saying I know we could interchange yeah, or find your character find their characters I feel whatever now let me have a clearer shot of the design of creation at this level I'm at and then things will start to whatever or find a character finder character okay now who's the self that underlies this finer character so we can interchange and play with them now be careful like first though uh not to smudge is that the word smudge uh you may not be able to see one clearly if you put the other one in there it's like is that my left hand right hand right now I can't tell which is my left and right it'll take me a moment to honestly like oh there it is oh yeah okay I got it but at first it's like I, can't tell kind of thing smudging uh so I wouldn't be too fast in running comparisons like that I, think I think uh better to for a while maybe work them one at a time, okay again with the stipulation space might be a good starter for all of them but anyway run of one at a time so the smudging doesn't happen so you stay with that one that one and whatever word teeth you use for that or uh Sean whoever used for that yeah is that, yeah, then you can sort of interchange say okay here I am now what world am I in or here's the world I'm in now who's the character here I think it interchanging fun around there yeah sounds like fun yeah in the domain level uh how to say it the all those overlay properly is it's much, much clearer did I say that right yeah um that feels like I think a possibility where the overlay is foreign okay whereas I know it's a little confusing so I like to do for quite a while one at a time for clarity or something but that clarifies especially in the domain level prepping for eventual Heavenly level kind of thing uh all right go ye himself but check the space if it helps I'm waiting kind of quiet Brad it's 7 30 maybe it had enough should we go eat Sensei this teacher I have I have one little piece that when I heard you talking more about uh about space it came to me in the in the traditions of meditation sometimes they talk about two different approaches to meditation of course there are many, different approaches and one of the approaches is called meditation without an object so that's like that's like appreciating how you're talking about appreciating or, or are present to space because it's not about the things that are arising in space are you saying that style is inferring space major yes it's space major for sure okay yeah but not space is an object space is a presence space is being without, other things yeah you know and the seconds I always say there's two yeah the second side is, meditation with an object so whatever your object is you maybe perhaps your, contemplating or meditating on self or meditating on character meditating on how to structure uh design is yes so those three self-character and design are meditation with an object or with a I know we weren't using the word Focus but this kind of one after four and the fourth one is meditation without an object and that's meditation in with space it's just a way of speaking of it yeah so I that's livable we'll see and as we continue the actual experience and can continue more original and more original all of this clarifies better okay yeah okay yeah that's like so that's a good enough close enough I have to do that with a lot of my stuff at the moment this is close enough yes doesn't mean I'm finished doesn't mean it's the end-all but at up to today this is what I can experience comfortably does it mean that's the end of it okay right remember people tend to stop short to get to a nice place whatever their sense of a nice space is and they stop yeah so we have a lot of stoppage along the way okay uh [Music] if you started let's say a normal class with 100 people and you went finer and finer and finer uh you're not going to end up with 100 people you know 10 are going to drop out on the 20 and then 30 are out you're gonna end up with a much smaller group to continue and continue that's to be somewhat inner sense there's more some calling for more I don't know the word make up your own word, to keep you going all right so when you get stopped someplace uh in the negative form you learn to hang out and, it'll explain itself if you hang out with it properly and open it'll explain itself if he hit a nice Zone that you really like let's say you're a nervous type and you, can finally you catch the trick about a hitting this a calm place so oh that's it that's it that's the answer that's God, is calmness um, if you don't have the calling you'll stop there that's a shame so you'll stop on a negative potential you stop on a positive potential uh but some of us have this thing calling or since they had this calling it couldn't stop you couldn't stop okay remember the Top cider in a country that was into martial arts at the time he could have stopped he was the top he continued he continued into what the hell is happening what's going on what is this he said he took a lot of from daguchi trying to say yes you're pretty cool now there's more of the creation here and there's more to you the self uh I said that, was it that easy but he hung in there and he hung in there and he hung in there okay so do the best you can that's all it's like Sensei I wonder if uh perhaps that's the way to leave it are you trying to get rid of us is that what you're doing Lauren I, am you've got some place to go Lauren I, I'm gonna sit right here for the next three hours so it kind of you just summed it up so, perfectly uh perhaps somebody would like to jump in now some more but uh it's open it's wide open People come on the flavor is we're going to cut it shorter tonight come on well I was just wondering if you could talk more about the construct design um oh other than um vibratory finer vibrations Center and circles seem important uh, the harmony of two the great e the great she the ah o uh all that stuff seems to be in there uh, if you're interested that's what you get to do for the next two weeks while we have a break you sit settle you might try more space with the sense of the design at somebody how would you if you like designer the construct Vision how would you start off uh your beginning of that or your starting point did I say that all right let's say I'm going to do a major character run I might start for a moment with Bobby to Robert to not know I might take a few moments and then I'm establishing I'm on a character run okay and then shift to more original who am I character how might you do it as a majoring in design construct of creation thank you nope well Sensei it's Justin for, me I, work on these, twos of Center and circle expansion contraction if I'm in private sometimes an odd oh and being clear this is this and that is that and get it and get it two Basics at whatever level your two Basics are at and then a sense of more original a sense of, course finer more original and see how it lays out does the whatever the sound frequency, change does it want to show a different form uh whatever let it unfold it's there to unfold it's not itself all those things aren't hiding from you they're there but we just have to learn to open to them and if we're too heavy in whatever sense uh they're there but you can't see it easy trade it in trade in uh downtime trade-in Trading is a good word I like traded trading in or the big dark down trade in uh so the next finer can show so yeah just whatever you're starting with and then you follow that pattern so what it's unfolding is the finer of character that I was mentioning or the design mentioning so uh so no Mike I don't want to say anything more about design I think it would that was a good one you say well there's two Basics that I'm aware of in my starting place and I'll start with that boom now it's your game you play yeah oh thank you I thought you said it quite a lot actually and it was helpful thank you uh yeah see we have to be careful of being just intellectuals uh where uh tell me more about that and I'll ponder it no way am I going to actually open and experience but I'll ponder it ponder it see if it fits in with my brain scheme understanding of things uh you gotta play you gotta experiment you gotta uh that's a, little sideline here maybe on that uh oh called The Domain a very important place like uh the domain oh since they called that is like a gym like a gym it's softly inferring uh, experience a lot or character a lot it's a laboratory here's your chance to play with different things see how they how they manifest uh, maybe even manifest into the uh manifest world um and a library so he more than once called off those three in the domain okay actually the people are more whatever intellectual I just do the Library part and they don't do the, more experienced gym so to speak part I'm not asking you to go out and push weights Amy you can go push weights you like that go ahead uh but I'm not telling you to do that it's not gymnasium in that sense but there is some experiential being a lot of emphasis also on the character kind of sense uh anyway that's from oh since they do with it what you will okay, so, I was just going to say I think I was I was just going to say I think I was trapped by my own lineage as an engineer the two words constructed design straight away guys you poor guys yes I know but you know um so no what you actually said was, great it's uh it's corrected that um that inappropriate um idea but if Einstein can get to a finer level of sensing not an engineer but it can't but an engineer ought to be able to get to a finer level where the engineering of the design construct of creation can show better and better so I'm just joshing that no way do you have uh snowballs chance in hell kind of thing uh, so I didn't pick up on that anyway I'm, often looking at certainly looking at the world around me and being Amazed by um by um yeah what nature or whatever has created it's, a pretty amazing place even at the Manifest level yeah creation is kind of amazing, and again more so as we get into the, more original and more original yeah thank you yeah thank you um, [Music] foreign okay let's say on sensei's Journey was uh real development here as from childhood okay you're just him on the beach going from the Wimpy sick here to holding his own to being the best on everybody and continuing with that uh ability to uh develop uh develop so good energy sense uh good balance of energy sent kept developing the body like martial arts so he was developing the martial arts along the way uh, where am I going where am I going where am I going then he continues to The Domain territory this is after de Gucci's pushed it is much more uh the de Gucci push came when he was pretty damn good with the as a martial artist really good really good he said if he had continued that pattern he would have been a, super potato a really, really good fighter but this addition he spent some time there, okay this is the uh pre-war, and during the war now he's moving into, this someplace I don't know the exact years but, a lot of time there are a lot of fun stuff can go on there a lot of good work can go on there moves in here you know we get a guy who can go from this old band really fast, he was fast he yoked it wouldn't take much or something like that thing and suddenly this transformation it's an old man but it wasn't an old man because all of this is in play I say he was standing there in a much finer sense and it's manifesting ah outward the finders manifest I'm not saying it will, but see that sort of always my question where is he coming from because I think people were very good at a much finer energy level and devoted their life to energy Tai Chi type stuff uh so wow they were good okay uh, arms right here Tai Chi really good energy little but osensei was well how does he do that where is he coming from I could see those other people had trained in staying in a horse posture for an hour a day or whatever day after day after day or walking around a tree so they were rooting the ground was actually getting rooted going down a, foot into the Earth because they were walking around it all the time so I, understood that I understood yeah I could do that if I've got I want to hang out that many years with it but this thing kept calling me up but oh sensei, I'm not sure where he's coming where is he coming from the sense of his depth for lack of words he was coming from something much finer much finer so that's why I didn't go off into the Orient Chinese Arts I like Chinese Arts I like the, energy I, liked all that stuff about him uh but if you said Chinese Arts are all Sensei no question oh Sensei because there's a sense of deeper something so much more there than just a finer energy sense of things or something uh so that's I don't I didn't say it well but uh this overlay this all these levels were right there where he was at right here right here right here and she do some amazing things although I don't know if I care about the amazing things because all along the way people can do a lot of little magic amazing things you know uh so sort of I want to use that too much as a criteria for anything but just to since when he was being all Sensei whoa, whoa, sorry I can't say it any better than that but that but uh but yeah and you guys can do this okay you did say that you guys can do this, Christ said that didn't he I'm not chew up on Christian but Christ said that now that you have a sense of the um spirit an experience with the spirit or when you do I forget the timing these and greater things shall you do whoa, so this inner finer, more original more original boom whatever Miracles he was doing he was telling those guys those guys these and more you will be able to do you shall do something yeah just to make the Christians happy tonight I think we're finishing up you got anything before I get off stage I was just going to say Sensei that you've used the word emanate rather than manifest previously and it's a more yeah a more comfortable fit yeah right yeah, thank you so much yeah if you've fine-tuned me on that manifest, a good technique uh, radiate has a different flavor yeah it's a fine tune Mitchell yeah manifest is to do something you know uh it comes through the doing of something radiating uh it doesn't have to necessarily do anything it can but you're just picking up that whatever anyway words find your own words be comfortable with them as long as they help you continue finer or eventually more original more original, okay, if the word gets in your way it's not good enough kill the Buddha along the way, let go of that word be more open and let it name itself it can do that it will do that okay a dumb small example Bobby, Bobby but when I do some opening and there's a say Anatole levels just one not doe level uh he doesn't like if you refer to him as Bobby he's like that's not me I'm not Bobby he's naming himself all right all right so if your magic word stops working and some of them get stale you run them as far as they can go and they run stale they don't quite do what they used to do for you easy continuing with that line what's it called itself at the next level, trade in Next Level what's it called itself and might experience it then it always renames itself at that level and then continues for a while a little beside I don't want you to do with that I think we're finishing thank you so much Sensei enjoy your holiday next week thank you sensei

actual feeling experience okay everything experience ah said Lincoln a little sense of opening here a little more space we will use space for tonight's warm-up practice easy it feels like a little more space and that's a bit of an inner feeling of more space it's not oh yeah there's more space or I wish this room was bigger so I could have more space I'm not doing out there as soon as possible the space I'm talking about a little more inner sense after a while five percent after a while five percent after a while since feeling sensing fence deep space inner, inner sense of space okay would start my brain spinning a little bit what do you mean by that how do I do that what does that mean again yeah easy relax, Here and Now a sense of more space and as best as you can and inner sense of more space you can learn more space here kind of getting a basic uh Circle a space yeah a feeling of the space heading into sensing more space sensing more space more space sensing more space but it doesn't mean anything to me yet so we hit it again easy inner, more space since experience more space no experience and then I shift my focus from more space to okay if I'm on the right track what's the body now I'm shifting it to body what's the body doing in more space which time it feels a little looser a little more fluid happening may the Lord flew it again a bit of flowing through the body but that's just I use the body to see if I was on the right track now, I'm not interested in the body now back to Inner finer more space easy more space not an idea only there's space experiencing itself could we say easy more space and space and space, somehow feeling sensing itself oh damn the words but we'll hang in here please, more space more space a little more depth of more space okay and why that's important to me is because I want to get away from awareness of space Oh yes I can imagine more space I've seen Star Trek I have an idea it's not it's not that there's it's important partner the experience, of more space experience some more space music now in the more space again I want to check back with the body you see, how I'm doing in more space body feeling itself and what else he needs a body in more space body space body uh it feels deeper I can't prove that I can still feel my feet on the road but there's a sense of deep extensions that's the body level uh longer a little bit of flow here I can almost begin to play with glowing energies are flowing on it uh, a Freer body beautiful glow body it's the true man that are on the right track okay now I shift again I was checking the body and again easy inner finer more space inner finer more space as if experiencing inner binder more space, you burnt you burnt more space finder where a good guess and experiencing it or it's experiencing itself has more space find your own words oh, okay then one more time I'm going to use the body just to check see how I'm doing in more space you see body how are you doing now the body needs to feel itself in more space referencing the body feels Fuller my body does still longer but also kind of stronger a better relationship it's like my legs are supporting my arm extension for example it's a better structured body a better body in relationship with itself body ah we'll begin for a second and more space music inner sense of Mars failure Faith fencing itself experiencing itself as opposed to just this mental yes more space I've seen Star Trek is I don't mean that okay does that warm me up a bit, push, okay better, okay now you've had a couple of weeks and I know you've been playing right, so space is cool can't go wrong with more space any more space better self and self itself is a unit you could have highlighted that one okay we start them off from the heavier levels as Bobby or Robert not go uh we could pass that and eventually there'll be an archetype character okay and you'll have a couple more of, those eventually ah The Constructor designed of creation I don't know uh, the great pulsating Energy Center Circle the great ups and downs the great he for she Force whatever the construct of creation the design of it okay oh so I'm sure in the last couple of weeks, you've sat you've sat and picked one of those and played with it or a couple of them where are you where are we that was a question by the way where are we Sensei this is Justin uh I guess I'll start us up um for so for, me um I had been gravitating towards self as a starting, place and um settling into a deeper sense of self um a, true me if you will presented for truer more original as you as you've mentioned uh I began to notice that without smudging these now that within a certain amount of space with self there is a space for self um giving room for self to manifest yeah and then within space there are the there's the construct and the nutrients that sort of dance within the space the space and then last of all uh character begins to appear to appear nice it seems to be for me again in that order is how they were they were coming to me in my experience itself and then self in space and then the nutrients come in and then there's a character that's lined up with whatever nutrients are appearing in this situation, could we stay here for everybody uh so he found a pattern uh he liked the pattern he was using the way he laid it out uh however the pattern appears for you okay so although we probably can't go wrong with space pretty early in the game or self pretty, early in the game or self pretty early in the game probably can't go wrong uh but if you get a great calling for well what's the design of creation or something then start with that one but space still helps a little bit of space first that's why we did space for a warm warm-up a little bit of space so that whatever next is important has room to show okay yeah so like space early in the game definitely but follow your own demands or inner callings or inner presentations uh you can't go wrong with those a little more rooms so that everything else can show better okay always I that, was just how it was laying out for me but they're, all inter woven or interrelated around each other as long as we don't smudge them without smudging exactly I tried to be very like diligent to keep each one in its own experience so to say but they're all were coming in and relating to each other we kind of did that on our early practice I hope we did it clearly space, and I said okay now I'm going to give the stage to the body see how the body feels in this bigger uh theater stage whatever okay and then the body said well I can I can sort of move a little bit okay good it referenced me more space now I'm shifting my attention from the character uh body uh to more space we had more space and we said Okay I, think this is a better space it senses experiences like a better space let's double check body in this space and I go oh, I can I feel longer I I'm breathing much better oh I had these extensions down through my feet my extensions don't stop at feet they continue my feet stop but the extensions continue to go that concludes man that I'm there's more space there and the depth of space is there but to be very clear when you're which piece you're working on so they don't smudge you see my idea wasn't laying this out uh was these are main pieces and they're going to show uh so for you to be able to, label them could I say to know which one is being present to know which one you're highlighting uh so that they don't smudge so your yourself and the character and the design, and you can't quite tell who's who and what's what and you get kind of confused you get a piece of this one and a piece of that one and, it's like what the hell is going on here uh so to set the stage space and then whatever wants to show next and then you go oh that's self oh okay self in the larger space it's a finer more original Self, and self has a sense experience about itself, so we say that pretty good what do you think Justin what do you think so yeah thank you thank you there's a couple other things that came up during these couple weeks but I want to turn the mic over to the rest of you guys and um maybe I'll jump back in again okay again okay somebody where are you what are you getting out of this you had two weeks yeah since they all say something I um, space I've just been hanging out with space in the past couple weeks because it feels like it's I can feel like it's in my muscles the layers stop it inner finer a bit more space, come on remember the little circle here and you had a bigger Circle yeah and a bigger Circle what are you doing in your muscles right now I didn't feel is the spaciousness feels it's, quiet and, open but there's also like nutrients there there's careful now let's not throw a bunch of stuff into space, let's just try to have space as space let's not put in stuff she said it might be the beginning of smudging oh there's nutrients there oh that's a designer that's a construct showing and, it's going to smudge so okay so let's, try to I think I'm right here people bear with me let's just try to have a sense of space as space don't, put a bunch of stuff in it yes there is stuff in it but, let's get Space when we're highlighting space okay let's not suddenly have uh on the stage of space suddenly a bunch of furniture and actors running around saying lines and let's not throw stuff in there when we're majoring in space best I can say it okay now continue with your, um body lineage here I was pushing space and then for me well self was self felt like it was a it was partly a, yearning like almost a childlike yearning, but an also an element of I don't know or an element of like let's go back to yearning, For What it's a word yeah you're looking for another Hershey bar come on goodness, hardiness I yearning like a childlike yearning an aspirational okay for a while, you said it say it again yearning for um, yeah I don't know I entered something coming downward a downward yeah, okay and the downward whatever is saying what, is it pretending again that bits like information that can be used go ahead your floor is yours um okay well the self and then I guess one of my questions was care like characters sometimes it seems like there's characters within characters oh God well character's overlay where Bobby stands Robert is where Robert is Nado is so maybe go ahead um well I guess I got a little more time about space where, are we going here, are you smudging me well I was working, with these with the, four space, stealth character and then concept design which I didn't get to because I was just okay out in space my suggestion for you is don't do four at the same time, you're gonna smudge the hell out of them just that's your thing for a while bass was a very good I think your presentation of Sunday there was a circle around your neck and then a circle around the around the heart area and then a circle around the hips are hotter area I think that was an introduction from your system saying hey look at how space works if you have this size space you're Bing banging in this in your head when you get this size space you're having more feelings going around the heart, it might be a little more emotionality or feelings you get the one that you picked up around a hot hour hip area uh more feeling physical feeling experience it, I believe it was trying to show you uh what happens in a smaller space ding, ding, ding, ding okay easy settle open more space with those kind of emotional feelings Maybe, easy settle more space then you start to include this area easy settle more space and we'll see I think for you I want to try to do all four because I don't think you're ready for all four at one time in fact everybody be careful of all four okay uh or have a distinction when you start to get distinct which is which then you can let them have turns like we did there's more space now body you can have a turn here body how are you doing in the more space okay thank you body now back to more space see I'm what's the word delineating them I'm being clear on who's who and who's on stage is it the stage itself or is it the body on stage or is it the self on stage or which aspect uh so I think for you uh because I thought space presented itself to you and said hey you this is coming from your system look at bing, bing I would have suggested that you stay with space for a while okay yeah thank you yeah and, again I would for you uh, don't do four at the same time uh in a sitting session whatever however long you sit a half an hour an hour whatever uh stay with one stay with one major in one for that time again after a while I get very you can tell which is which and then you can go okay thank you uh character now back to space or thank you space now self, and here comes self taking the stage from the center self uh so something like that so, we don't smudge okay, if I said it right ah, somebody what you've been doing where are you you're gonna say something or I won't know where to go because Steve yeah um well I've been spending a lot of time with space but, particularly this last thing that we just did what was what was really interesting is how uh you know we, were referencing space as an experience which when it started it's not an experience it's a kind of a an idea yeah it's an idea and I could actually feel I didn't feel it right away but in, retrospect once I space became more prominent I realized that I was reaching I was reaching for the space because when space really emerged as an experience there was nothing I was doing other than being present to the experience it was there showing itself could we say it was there beginning to show itself more yeah and maybe it was a very dramatic shift that happened in spite of myself yeah so that, was a good experience from that from this past exercise I almost figured anything I start I'm starting with an idea first yeah gee I think I just sit with space okay that's an idea and I know that's not space yeah right okay, easy settle open the space is that space is it there yet how do I know it's space maybe I'm lying to myself that's not space yet although even though it's there I'm so busy screwing myself over easy said oh yeah and then after a bit it's it itself being present showing itself like you said yeah, all right people do the best you can with our words because these things get very hard to talk about and they don't get any easier, okay we start having different not only different dimensional language but uh when we make a better change from the Manifest linear world that we're in to this more original underlying that one we're calling it The Domain, okay the languaging it's even worse okay God forbid you reach a Divine level underlying that the language will really be, we'll do the best we can okay, uh anyway were you finished Steve yes, I was yeah, you hang out with it and more of it shows as Steve said I like the way he said it it's, here showing itself but he said it better than me anyway somebody where are we where are you what have you been playing with this is Nancy, how you doing great self has been since we did a work on it a month or two ago I have a much more abiding sense of presence of self it's a very friendly personal um affirmative yeah right it's personal it's, present more often in no matter what I'm doing and that's a wonderful development and uh there's, resources there I can kind of just relax into and just let them kind of I trust that if they're not there at the moment they'll be there you know anytime soon so that's just been a very nice ongoing practice for the last few weeks foreign yeah nice to have a good uh What, to call this feeling for experience of experience of self yes uh for example if you suddenly get wiped out killed die he's like boom and stuff was there did you have a familiarity or experience with self no big deal oh yeah that's gone here I am self okay the transition can be very, fast very neat and very how to say advanced that level can move along much faster better to a better level much better, to a better level much better than whatever and anyway so it's nice for a person to have a better and better sense of self the inner self the truer self bodies come and go now those come and go but the self is the constant one okay yeah thank you I really appreciate our work with this yeah fun huh yes it is very fun ah seems like a little bit of work sometimes but when you reach certain levels it's fun well it shows up by itself you know so to speak no pun intended, yeah uh yeah again entrusting the space go back to spaces first for example in trusting the space in more space eventually it's like now who wants a turn who wants to be next and one of the other three other kick in is one way of looking at it okay, somebody what you got where are you what are you working on bumping into any bumps what great insights uh Bob here been working with character and specifically catching more clearly that in my case character tense has a tendency towards smudging in a sense that it wants to check with the other parts rather than feeling itself more fully okay so I've been getting better with that, [Music] okay hang on there for a bit let's see uh character error to character foreign alternating it or partnering it with space would that help you think yes yeah yes yeah if character seems to be stalling could I say stalling you use different words but what'd you say I just said smudging it's, what's my joke with the other parts instead of feeling itself I guess it can and then okay now I'm changing the focus I'm changing now there's more space getting a sense of more space and then after some minutes or whatever go back to the character in the more space that, might be a good potential way of, getting out of smudge territory maybe there's not enough room okay possibility try and see definitely will do that yeah character okay somebody what you got what's your insights what are you having fun with hey since there's mac here from New Zealand, mark, yeah okay Mark yes um I've been spending quite a bit of the time with um self and um previously to my training I, always started you know I was always kind of pumping the character as such but the, whole thing seems to have kind of flipped when, I actually kind of play with, self to a certain a point where I can feel it notice it I don't know the exact word there but um I'm heading this thing where uh when I'm doing something I, kind of sort of say uh right and kind of letting self come through and show me I'm sure I did what comes through that so, rather than starting with character actually it's done with self in, an activity and letting it sort of come through to sort of show me what to be part of whatever I'm doing um it, seems like a complete flip to what I used to do you just pump the character until one day self sort of was there but doing it it's kind of the other way sort of working with itself and then and then any character that happens to be there is just naturally improved um there is there's the character is still a character but, there's something, it's like the character's got a weak glow to it or you know it's, different from character there's something more that will come through there, yeah yes I can sort of say it uh it's character with a weep s it has a plus now Mark could just pause for a second please yeah pause, for a second please yeah pause yeah I'm having trouble hearing yourself I don't quite follow what you're saying uh your voice is smoking over here Sensei can I help you yes so normally he develops and pumps the character aspect and self reveals but lately he's been working self and character is revealing and the character, is revealing and the character that is revealed has a wee glow to it it's somehow better character a better character are you good with that Mark yeah, it's, okay let Sensei respond now he just so thank you Sensei yeah so you can bounce any two back and forth better character and you seem to be reaching your limits or something okay so and now self takes the stage the stage better self now the character within the self, has more room so it's kind of like space has more room and more a selfness to be a better character so it doesn't make me win a self character or character self so you bounce all these things all around they're all in relationship just be clear people on, what you're doing so you don't smudge them and you get confused as to where you are and who's who is all I'm trying to say is that it was that maybe Mark the answer anything yeah, no it was it was just um I like that word selfness uh so what did you say silkness the selfness coming through, um, yeah and but um but having a sense of that makes that makes, the characters easier as well I don't have to work as hard uh yeah no character ought to be naturally mixed of my word mix I don't know if that's a good word uh, that that's a natural sound that's how Bobby's got to mix up a robber dog how do I do that and I don't even know who Robert is how am I supposed to it's, not that's not right people yeah, mistakes we make along the way um, some are open and allowing uh you're in your own Universe kind of thing of course there's a character in a finer character I don't know easy open let's find our character easy open Don't Panic where is it is it here yet is it going to be okay uh let it unfold whatever let's face unfold let's self show it's their unfolding let character unfold gee how does the what are the main beats of creation what's the design of creation easy settle give it a little room that's where I like kind of like space give it a little room so it can unfold and show how it works yeah, uh so I, think I'm trying to point out the naturalness that we work too hard and in our working too hard we slow things down we potentially even tighten up on them uh and it's too really it's too fear uh it's too available uh, in a certain way it's too clear, uh obvious uh ah the pieces being the pieces uh know what they're about they have their own intelligence about themselves their own experience of themselves could I say now Bobby's got to experience that I'm dead in the water uh damn the words damn the words but I'd like to push on this naturalness uh let me see if I could do it at this moment naturalness there's a great beat of creation that goes heavier and Tighter we, call it and that's where I can go from a not though to a Bobby to a weird Bobby because it goes tighter but the equal force to that goes back into finer and finer and finer and finer so is that not the main thing this naturalness of the what they call it the pullback the return back uh and we make a lot of work how can I do that how can I be a better person and then we slow things down and there's a lot of work how can Bobby the pain in the ass Macho idiot be a nice guy that's damn hard for Bobby it's not virtually impossible but in this naturalness of a drawback natural return sounds like a word or something might have used the return back it's returning back to its origin to the finer more original of itself and I think I'd like to go over that better another day soon uh for us to be able to take advantage of that natural pullback natural and I don't mean back, there uh into the finer origin which is here it's a natural draw a natural movement that we can take advantage of more uh at the market into his work the more I see how it's certainly how hard we've made things how hard we work and when it's just kind of a misunderstanding like Bobby trying to be a robber how can Bobby be a robber he's a Bobby, be a robber he's a Bobby if Bobby lets go easy there's a little more room there ah there will be a Robert there okay but Bobby doesn't trust right away he's screwing things up how do I know there's going to be a Robert there there's going to be a Robert there it works for other people but it doesn't work for me because I'm, one of those weird guys there's a simplicity since they told me over and over not though it's so easy it's so easy but you have to catch the trick and so to speak I do not use the word trait but pretty close to that uh, that, you have to catch on through experience some of the trick that it's not just a, given here to trick people go, ye and be Saints or whatever, otherworldly or great, beings uh in a certain way can't be given that way and I sort of wonder if I overdo it you've got to play you gotta practice you gotta for like the words meditate you gotta sit down oh yes you can do it walking yes, yes but also sit down settle and open and, let the inner finer of things show you, have to do that you can't just listen to me talking and memorize the diagram say oh yeah I understand uh it's not going to do it it's not going to do it there has to be an actual practice, an actual sitting could I say in whatever form you want to sit but hopefully then that in your sitting style whatever uh that there's an opening that there is the allowing of whichever of the main pieces you want to show you have to put time in okay, I'm just trying to make the, journey a little easier by showing you some of the highlights and by saying well people might get a little confused between the different pieces showing they may be smudge showing so if we can say look at first there's space or not necessarily first but there is space there is self there's a character and there's a design to things and now there's an earlier finer more original, more original of all of those but you still have to sit and play open experience have the experience or allow, those to show that they're experiencing themselves, self is experiencing itself characters appearance of self-design has its own experience being part of the design and the words okay but anyway you gotta do something you got to do something if it's just lecture time uh I could probably write all this out in a little short booklet or something and say here and you study and you go okay but if you don't actually sit and play ah intellectual knowledge won't do it the importance of this inner experience part I can't tell you how important that is the intellectual knowing understanding approach yeah you'll expand the brain thing yeah but you won't be able to go any real distance not a real distance because the partner to that the experience of it is not there so you'll get spun out sorry but that's the way it works okay don't know if I said that well either but so be it somebody where are we uh Sensei this is Lauren and I think you said it very, very, very, very well just now as someone who's been trying to work on how to write down what you're saying, um you know very eloquent and what I am struck by especially is the point you just made at the end which is that let's say that there's a progression or that there are these four major things space self character design that there is a more original version if you will or instantiation finer um I want to use the word more spiritual but you don't like that word let's just leave it at finer yeah finer energy finer Dimension that it repeats again there's still at that finer Dimensions space self character yeah these are our big four they go all the way back right and, so at every Dimension we have this same practice and it I also am hearing you say you know it's really one thing and I'm just breaking it apart for clarity of practice Yeah you know I say that well they're so intertwined, and interrelated and one leads to the other leads to the other and then you're back where you started so the key thing I heard tonight was that they there's a finer version of these big four at each dimension yeah and right there uh dementia might be an okay word uh but it just because I'm going to use we've used dimensional in our linear manifest World Bobby Robert Nado we've used dimensionality there uh but again when we start saying okay but I'm sort of bored with improving Nado and Mr Nado and Sir NADA and it goes on and on for virtually forever what's more original what's more original and there's a little different tact right there um, which might show dimensionally but I don't want to use Dimensions because we're used to Dimensions like a ruler one inch to two inch row I'm improving to three inch holy am I fantastic holy I'm the best and I'm the richest guy in the country I'm the most handsome guy in the country I'm the fastest runner in the country and uh, I, I, heard you Echo osensei's words in Japanese and it's to return to the center return to the origin and I know when I first heard it, gave me great hope you know because uh whatever you are today there is an original Self that, you're still in relation to still connected to yes yeah yes continuous and again what I try to tricks of the trade is if you just think about this you like the idea and, it gets pretty bright and fancy but it won't do it the idea alone the awareness alone won't do it so I say people I'm telling you really need also the experience, I'm aware of something finer okay good now it's counterpart is the experience okay and because we're starting kind of let's say smaller the experience at first won't be fantastic but lo and behold it's a bit better okay it's like I lifted my arm that'll open oh the arm floated up whoa, and it feels longer and stronger and it feels more sensitive whoa pull touching my lady friend or massaging my buddy or shaking hands properly oh yes I'm at a better level uh so those are just warm-up Clues to head in the right direction I got lost in what I was talking about I'm sorry Lauren go ahead thank you Sensei thank you yeah again uh hang on one sec back to what he said uh again oh since he says don't go anywhere because you're directly connected I, know it's a bit of a mess I know that I God knows I know that uh, but you're still directly connected easy and in that more opening your line up to the connection and in more opening uh as a self a better level of self that's there can sort of present itself and affect you better character will be there a better uh a flavor feeling of the design of creation will, be there so you're, right there I know it's kind of small and tight but that's right in the middle of your creation setup sorry fetchoff who, was that Gina, Gina hi, Gina hi, so first I want to thank you for separating these because I think you started really separating them about three weeks ago and before that, I was just trying to cram them all into one sitting and getting all jumbled up were you smudging this stuff I think I was a big pleasure so two weeks ago I just decided to as you say major in space because it seemed so nothing to me I thought well I you know, and it was really hard I had a lot of resistance but I stuck to it and I and I got through a few days and then I thought okay I'll just do it for one week and then I started really loving space and you know there was a lot going on there and well for a second could I turn around and say space loves itself yes it really does that's what really came through it just loves being space because it gets to see all this creation going on from the time of yeah one more time Bobby don't love nobody how can Bobby love space say impossible it will never happen base as it begins to show itself and be present cares about itself as space it's a major piece I'm on the right track yay what's wrong with me I don't love space well of course not well of you either now if we hang a little bit me and you maybe it'll turn into a deeper liking and a little bit maybe I'll really care for you, know let, let it show itself and anyway sorry I really worked I love space after two weeks I'll tell you and yeah thank you yeah great my question is um can you just talk a little bit about the difference in character and self I mean isn't your character aren't they yeah they have a sort of a well everything is overlaid but self and character are strongly overlaid especially at first yes what to say there what to say there I like somebody else jump in uh Bob you got anything to say about this Noah what's your sense of that question the distinction between character and self, the character is sort of a role that you play so which are quite basic and others are kind of incidental but it one analogy that works for me is the, self is like the body and the characters the clothing that the body wears okay so if a woman of weed in my backyard I'm going to wear jeans and whatever if I'm going to a steak dinner at the white house then I'm going to wear a tuxedo but it's still it's still me self yeah I, liked his analogy that's where he worked right but I don't like the use of the word I, like the analogy again not the use of the word body to represent self because we have enough problems with self-embodies very true for that reason I'd say yeah but I prefer not to use the word body there but I like the analogy yeah but body meaning really uh, a constant self uh, not the way you're using it you said there is a costume but this self a lot of Us costumes but doesn't wear a costume but it allows a character to put on whatever costume is necessary okay, you've got to say it that way I didn't say lightly who brought that up Gina, where are anybody else want to jump in on Jada's question the difference between character and self Deja with your Eastern experience do you have anything to say here with that you know I have to go right along with uh Noah because I think he, said it really well in the distinctions that were making that Gina called for in that was the distinction from uh of, the self to the character so I, love the analogy that Noah brought forward I thought that I thought that really works because it is as you began to say Sensei it's touchy territory how do you actually uh distinguish those I think that was it so tightly they're all overlaid but they're tight, yes yeah thank you good one Gina well another one Gina that we've discussed over the time has been uh the sense that self is immutable I think was something that Noah was saying and character is appropriate for the situation about the situation yeah and so uh sometimes the situation will call forth a character from you sometimes you screw up your character to be appropriate for the situation but uh you know it works both ways but it should be a natural kind of thing going on there yeah and the example that often used is you know the character that you are at work is some somebody that needs to do certain things and act a certain way and be a certain person and then when you go home it's usually you need to change to a home type person if you have a family or a pet or even if you're only by yourself you're not at work and so those are two of your it's just still you, right it's still you but it's a different sort of aspect or presentation or character of you yes I think so if you're doing a sitting how do you pick which one you don't need to you Jesus said you don't have to pick I'll, make space you will be emergent it will be self-emerging just the right one will show up whatever the situation is then the natural happening there uh this is potty planetary you're in a particular situation, spotted plant to the centered which becomes a character or a particular plant is the right plant for that situation do they say that all right people okay that makes sense but then I you know I kind of thought we were going Beyond oh, those kind of things that this was like the next I mean I will I'll work on it well Gina if, I can if I can offer you something just and see if this how this resonates with you um when you're when you're it when you're when you're it when you're working with meditation in this way you don't want to preconceive what it is you're going to, um have uh an Insight with or practice with so that's what I was that's why I was saying you don't need to you don't need to, understand or try to even uh project what, it is that you're going to uh be practicing with so if you're practicing with space as you beautifully uh expressed earlier you're letting that have its you're letting, that have its you're letting space have its presence it's being and you're listening to that so when you look when you're listening to that you're not uh from uh another place trying to impose on space I hope that was is that useful yes that's yes that's hard for me to let go of that control I want to tell it what to do well said though it's good observation you made another thing that you might think of is, if, uh space is like the stage the self is an actor is, the actor is always the same actor you as an actor don't change you are that actor, don't change you are that actor but then as a character you're going to wear different clothing you're going to become something appropriate for that role that the actor is, uh playing I kind of like that uh analogy also, the self is being the actor but he's not a character yet but he's an actor and anytime you need a character whatever something happens has to be a character and suddenly there's the actor wearing his costume there's a character yes okay but if we agree on that today thank you thank you thank you uh, I, think one game I used to play in boxing couple things back and forth was uh either as a finer level of self uh, experiencing that and then saying okay now character here at this level of self and just let the character Assemble and show itself and be present and I probably did that I definitely did it with self or it could probably do it with space you'd think oh this is a larger space okay who is the character changing my whatever change and then the character in a larger space I mean didn't we do that for our warm warm-up, we had space and I said well let's check with, the character and see how it's doing and in a larger space the character had more flow and more whatever fluidity and whatever, whatever fluidity and whatever, more groundedness at a particular level where they're using space or self character you can give the stage to character and let the Character Show itself, are we are we talking the same language here tonight this is Bob again yeah you, pointed out uh a long ago uh a good example of a healthy relationship between the character and the self there was a TV series called The Prisoner, and it was kind of a science fiction sort of fantasy series and in the culminating scene of the series uh the main actor Patrick McGowan and his protagonist are locked in a cell and they have this very, intense interaction after the scene was over the Leo the current who played the bad guy was so intense with the scene that he ended up in the hospital and they asked me going about it he said well I was just being a character you know it was you let it go and he was fine there was no illness or entanglement between the self and the character for him before the other guy he got so entangled between the self and the character he actually got ill yeah it's uh you pointed that out at the time I remember when that series was on is Autumn on tonight yeah autumn no Sensei yeah uh it's a good reminder to Autumn that for me from you know, my viewpoint uh an actor is like as the ability of allowing different characters to get mixed my phrasing to get mixed to allow a character and the Fuller of the character uh and then when the show is over you clear from that because you're, clear here how about I just call it uh you go back to just being an actor but there's no role there's no there's no role there's no tie-in locked into the last character if it's a bad guy you know finish up the show being a bad person it's, it's I'm not saying it well angry disability to be clear to allow a character to be there so if the director says uh could you pick it up a bit and you allow more of the character and if the director says could you tone it down a bit you go oh okay I'm kind of angry but I'm not going to kill you but I'm just got to let you know I'm kind of angry okay it's a tone it down it's something that the character in his mix can readily do and I don't know if I said that well but to me that's, uh an important piece of acting uh um see a lot of people are confused about an actor uh and uh so again I think I mentioned this long time ago but I was attending this uh dialogue lecture by this famous uh acting coach lady I don't remember who she was but very famous had a big crowd there a aspiring actors and uh one guy in the audience had a question he said I have trouble being a bad character and, she said oh yeah and you could see she's heard this many times before from many people and she didn't really know what to say to him at that oh that's interesting she's a pro, he was he was retaining his Hudson is Bobby or Robert and then trying to be a bad character and they were getting confused so Bobby didn't want to be a bad guy he's not and so he had trouble allowing a bad character he couldn't allow a bad character he said Bobby is not the actor the actor is Mr clear and Mr clear allows bad guy according to the script because it's not going up through Bobby and Nado and stuff it's just you're clear and anything can mix there so an actor has that capability I don't know if I said it well but not bad I think anyway since I, think you did this is Elaine I like the way you said that actually and it resonates a lot with um how we work with clients and probably you know a lot of other situations in, certain ways there is a way that you know we um remain clear and in a way neutral so that this um ability of sensing um can be can also be clear that was coming through from the client and what develops between us can actually be something that's relevant and appropriate and it's not necessarily at all appropriate for the next person who comes in the room and, it's not that I feel like I have to be a different um it's not like I'm acting a different role per se but I am actually being in a way a slightly different presence for each person don't use the word clearly different things you know um, and, the guidance that we can offer is, going to be way more relevant um if there is that you know specificness and a Clarity in between you know that coming back in between um, is I think you described that really well actually I appreciate it yeah I think in the May or what it got the main, mainstream medical the doctors uh that some years back they were having a lot of trouble with this some are very uh separate from you uh they didn't really have a bedside manner not, really they kept very what's the word very professional, old huh distant a certain way and a few of the other doctrines say no we have to have a relationship or a bedside manner or something so there was this, problem I attended at excellent a little dialogue in this air area and uh so I think a little bit what you're talking about but if you're clear uh you can feel what they're feeling feel what may be the uh your best um approach on working with them is but that doesn't mean you walk away with their illness in fact utilize or reminded me uh Steve you may have been there in the old days in L.A uh I was teaching these mainly psychologists were there uh teaching them to uh, feel the problems of their clients yeah and uh one of them I a patient somebody said it's a headache we'll just go in and feel I don't know their headache and why they're getting a headache or something and then, we finish with that pass and he said oh I've got a headache and I laughed and I said you're not supposed to go in there and experience it and retain it you're going clear could I use that word now you go and clear and say oh this guy's got a headache with that amount of pressure okay and maybe the cause of it okay and now you go back to clear so when you're finished you don't have a headache you just were clear in the experience of again don't know what those words are right but that was that following you or sort of kind of, Elena yeah, anyway so whether you're doctoring or, acting and say something about see that's an ability of ours because of the self eventually self will bring up a word I don't know if we have uh the transparency of self this is a very, advanced level of self a transparency of self where self can be present and everything's going on and self has experiencing what all the main pieces are experienced it's not interfering but it's their present with all of that it's clear okay or transparent yeah so it can experience everything but not be uh negatively affected by anything uh didn't say I um this is Tom I really like what you just said and it also relates to uh for me this discussion reminds me of an ancient vendantic uh story about the tree with two birds and there's uh one bird that sits in the tree and observes and the other bird is eating the fruit of the tree but the bird that observes is living vicariously through the bird that's eating the fruit so he's aware of the whole tree aware of all the fruit but this other bird is so focused on the fruit it's a story of purusha which represents the self or the grant the greater self and the treaty which is a creative energy uh female energy, uh female energy so this bird this tree with perus and prakriti the Observer the one that's sitting in the tree observing everything not eating the fruit and the other bird which is devouring of the Manifest in the in the tree it's an ancient story but it's consistent through our understanding of how Consciousness and the self and how we manifest our experience my short example of that would be yes oh aware or have an idea or see okay the burden tree but the next part and the counterpart the partner if you would eats, partakes of that you need both words and too many of us hello out there too many of us are doing the seeing understanding brainy bird I got no we got to start someplace but stop it are you experiencing now really expert double check that because there's a tendency to oh I'm aware of the word experience I know that means eating and chewing and you taste the food and the food has this vitamins we just damn world stop it that's more of that you gotta actually experience eat the damn stuff damn stuff inhale it Slurpee I've tried to present this with so many dumb words be present experiencing and watch out for this bird you'll jump the gun on that he'll be able to spell experience and think he's got it he's not eating anything yet or a very minor bit a very minor bit he's eating somebody else is dropping or something but it's not the fullness it's not the fullness, it's not the fullness bad that we're finishing up people we're okay for tonight thank you thank you so much Sensei thank, you thank you so much Sensei thank you yeah thank you Sensei I think we are right close to eight o'clock and uh it's time to go me and Brad need pizza tonight well we don't want to keep your pepperoni waiting thank you so much Nancy and thank you everyone we'll see you next week and uh, uh all contributions are welcomed and gratefully accepted yes thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you everyone so thank, you thank you everyone so thank you, that was a wonderful story Tom Lewis hi everyone

you are there sir yes good evening good evening okay I [Music] thought we'd do something and easy just to refresh certain things and get a sense of how to move along a little bit more in certain things I, was thinking the uh you all have different vehicles that you use uh for example a lot of us are aikidoest uh I'd like to sit lately the last few years I like to sit and inquire uh I know many of you are musicians so when you play your instrument are you doing the inner work and I'll ask you to dialogue with that so those of you who are musicians um and be ready to jump in with your insights of your inner development using your outer instrument as a reference ah, Roy's not on tonight but I know he likes to walk and while he's walking he's doing some inner exploration finer Dimension stuff uh Amy Florida on tonight yes she is Amy you want to come on yeah we just want to give her wait hold on a second I'm here from New York you can't stop I just wanted to give you a heads up for later we're gonna dialogue you mentioned swimming and what you do and I think you mentioned what didn't you did you mention about something else walking I remember we talked about walking okay later, soon, bye okay bye okay ah Autumn nice to see you and since I've gone let's see Noah likes tight she as a reference, hi CeCe hi so I think we'll, try to see if anyone wants to jump in on their different forms uh or Adam let's call that meditating inner inquiry different forms different Vehicles is that sort of okay yeah, but before we do maybe we should do some uh simple let's get present let's do something really simple you're ready to stand oh I'm not but I'll give it a shot oh okay here we are ah because we have to walk around uh sort of encased in this body uh let's start there with it simple, I was thinking about simple I, call them dumb exercise okay what simple exercising could we use okay let's take a pretty simple and pretty dumb it's just left and right up right and left down easy eyes easy for me inferred settling in opening easy, you know there's a sense of more rumor openly so that what I my flavor of that word means [Music] okay here of course we're starting probably with some degree of thinking figuring out you need to see let's settle down more into the body and left and right up right in left down a little inference on that a little bit better level I don't even pay me like a tenth of an inch but a little better level okay and ah ABC and left and right up that's down feel, ings Ursula was a feeling maybe the gross actually that's okay feel it because I didn't say it was going to feel good but feel you see me being present here and the left and right arms feel yourself remember your simple Basics that you settle down and open up or accessing more energies uh so make sure that opening up that there's room for the more energies to flow through if you don't have enough room the energies flow through and maybe we'll add to your constriction okay so push you out from being rooted and at whatever level you're at thank you select them right are coming up to a new train easy open eyes uh I want to say finer feeling no finer feeling at this level I find your feeling yeah foreign balance right and left down inferring balance and this circle is easy open ah I feel finer, feeling minor finer feeling a little Iraq you see the balance of the left and the right upward flow right and left down balance to a better level our next level easy open, ER final feeling uh finder finer being really examples but the last one there's much more back support because when my fingers are starting to get warm and tingle are coming alive more and you've got to drift of that path um and it um and it should be getting close to shifting from Pioneer feeling to feeling sensing okay in your current level we're at balance left and right up right and left down better level better level easy is for the room um I couldn't stop the difference there nothing major that's fine there'll be a couple of passes you do where it doesn't seem to have changed it may happen it was a minute enough he didn't quite catch it that's fine whatever level we're at I understand this anyway I haven't inspired thanks, in this finer more open space thanks, not for me it's a big sort of a big joke uh for foreign I feel myself a bit like a field not this body but instead of like a field that was expensive of being like a field body field and energy field body whatever, Jesus, [Music], from the little Merchant meaning sensing feeling sensing finer sensing to have the balance of left and right upwards, you see the balance of writing matter yeah Hogwarts let me see more room binder level Here and Now please stands the feeling sensing fire and you understand that I think that one was also for me a, sort of a past or to a lot of energy to my head and I couldn't sense Trio and you think particular that's fine, pass continue easy from the level we're at balance of left and right and the balance writing left down award um [Music], movement leads to more open finer levels yeah yes for example for me is more awareness if I were on the if you don't match I might right now like to do some techniques where okay is coming in behind me and I'm working with him I just feel more sensitive, around in the areas I can't see yet for example oh one more one more one more present resident but inner finer the American Pioneer present patterns of down find your Zone you're in and say bye next time oh uh fingertips or whatever very sensitive if I were a piano player now I would like to check out my finger activity on the keys for example easy because this inner finder affected by powder activity for example okay they can pause on that you're shy oh what I call a simple practice or a dumb Practice What You where'd you get out of that Sensei this is Justin hey Justin hi I, um gradually was noticing more freedom of, movement of the body and um you know more, presence as I was moving uh up balance down balance right left and eventually as I was expanding up I simultaneously felt experience a depth um so I was I was going up and down at the same time yeah and then down and up at the same time so to speak yeah in a sort of balanced full way eventually yeah no at a certain level that's a natural people where the up runs into the down that's already coming down and, the down coming down and, the down coming down runs into the up that's coming up that's a certain level of balance and uh and uh with some of the practices we've done in the past you should have bumped into that it's a pretty natural happening uh, I remember because my earlier years of working uh was up and down energies and I loved up and down energies in my development okay and then one night I'm in a dojo loan uh and I'm working my basic up and down and suddenly it started to go up and down and down and up and it really threw me and there's some extra energy and it really they got a little pissed what is it what's going on because my, beautiful basic up and down was being disturbed, not knowing enough how it worked in retrospect the up and down got good enough where another piece wanted to come in the down up piece wanted to come in uh but not knowing what it was and just bumping into it, hurt me there's extra energy there and it dried I didn't know what to do with it whatever, anyway finally you worked it out but any anytime things double up could I say uh don't be shocked probably a good idea to get a little more room there uh Don't Panic easy let it unfold it unfold okay don't run away and try to figure it out because you're moving into a much finer Zone you're Bobby figuring out won't work very well just let it unfold it will clarify if you're properly there letting it unfold it'll naturally clarify it might take a day might take a week okay, sometimes I sit out here on the front porch and for a week not much goes on you know even though I'm moving my arm that's not happening to anything but then somebody clarifies it's like oh okay that's the major oh okay it's gonna be easy yeah thank you ah somebody get anything out of that oh quiet we are I told you there's a dumb practice they didn't get anything out of it I'll say something hey Sensei it's dusty um yeah I noticed that like letting go because it was you know went to some beautiful places but letting my thoughts go around it and faster, and not getting caught up and being spun out there almost given a little bit of gratitude for it like a little bit of celebration of it of it for it and then it was easier to let go of when I like yeah banked it yeah getting better good uh it's an important thing he's saying here uh as we do these things and let's say uh different things show at finer levels there'll be a tendency to win oh and, let me figure that out and, all right and to not do that okay because you get a little next click and it's a bit different and then you spend your lifetime studying that, one click thing and I, don't want to do that I, want to continue to move along Move Along move along uh but that's a trick that does say starting a big pickup on that, can happen I'm not interested thank you ah let's continue yeah so it sounded like that's what you're saying yeah, good cool yeah good for all of us to remember that uh because as you open up settle down move through different dimensions there's some fascinating interesting things that can show stop the journey and get out and spend a lot of time it's like you're in a train and you get up at a stop because something caught your attention and but you spend your life studying that little town because it looked cuter whatever reason you got off the train uh so you don't want to do that on a regular basis I don't know how to say that clearer but you got the drift yeah somebody or are we here with this warm-up practice ah nothing important Mike sensei I might get you that is who that Mike, from New Zealand yes we see the, shape of the hairdry well yes Michael oh that's a giveaway yes I guess, what I found with the exercises uh obviously settling and then that felt really good and balanced becoming more of a sense of my whole body being balanced, um and then starting to feel um warmth in my hands and then that progressed eventually to tingling in my fingertips, and then that progressed to literally uh genuinely feeling like there was something, that I was holding that was tangible in my hands so it was almost like there was an invisible wall there that there was there was substance um yeah do you think yes well yes, um and it was very distinct um, yeah it was something I was able to hold and run my hands around and um but no, sense of attachment to it, was just like, noticing on the way if you like um I didn't get preoccupied whether but it was quite a distinct sensation how to say that so in the in the beginning there's nothing in my hand it's just my hand right but at a certain level there is something in the hand that's tangible at that level all right yes now if I go back to Bobby's level there's nothing in my hand I must have made that up I must be fooling myself uh so trust your, practice say trust or if you're not sure I think my trick there is well we'll see if it's true it'll show up again it'll get clearer we'll see I don't fight with it you know I don't fight that I make that up is that really happening you're wasting time people you know you do that but I like that sense of Something's there in its own Dimensions something can show but in a heavier Dimension can't show something like that is, that okay you know that, sounds a quote thank you yeah, okay, uh so uh, so uh okay so those people that utilize something else as a practice time okay this thought of that movie wax on wax off just came it took over my space there uh that's a job and it's not just oh your hands learn to move this way and that way that's a real heavier I bet it's true but it's the heavier of it but if you're doing more inner work there's something oh my God the center moves the hand the center moves the hands oh now we're getting let's continue finer and finer so uh and anyway I got taken over by wax on wax off sorry uh so Amy Florida let's start with you uh, swimming so you just don't swim to swim right you're on um no I don't swim to swim um actually you inspired me uh you know over the years all these years I've been um going into the ground going deeper and deeper into the ground and um you said to me that, was too thick that I should go that I should start settling down into the water a finer Dimension so when I swim now and you also say something else which inspired me you said that um when you were studying with osensei he told you that you were too much in your head um I figured if you're too much in your head I really got a problem so I use swimming as a way first what I do is I just kind of settle into the, feeling of the um of the stroke you know uh the side stroke that I do yeah, so that I'm not in my head I'm just feeling the side stroke the water you know and then what I do is I um ask it to, come through me and to you know uh there's a finer Dimension there's a finer level of self and as um and then I just open to it and receptive to it and it starts to talk to me and move through a second, now she's shifting her reference to self when she's saying I let it come through me and talk to me she's shifting to self that's there she didn't make that clear enough so I'm adding that for clarity okay so she gets the body move the body movement ah it helps ease the eye mind nothing much to think about there right and then she directly says and self I know you're here whatever come hang out with me show me your hair talk to me whatever you're on yeah and I, at times I ask it a question you know um you know what do I need to be focusing on or what's the what's the uh um, foreign, you know what's getting in my way or I don't know whatever the question might be and then I just listen and, it, changed it, downloads something comes through, yeah, okay so swimming as a meditation style that's our vehicle could we say yeah, and I also use it when I'm walking you, you also shared this which inspired me you said that um when you walk you let it walk you walk you let it walk you and let you know let the energy walk you so I've been playing with that too um just instead of me just doing my walk just allowing it to come through me and walk me in whatever way it, um mocks me okay could we say there that in that case you're uh continuing with the uh body form so I walk as I settle and open there's something finer in here who's a finer Walker and if that one stack said you open that one starts to establish the finer Walker walks the heavier human Walker yeah, yeah, so in that case she didn't shift herself she, stayed with the body in the finer and the finer could I say yep and then I use it I use I use this stuff a lot I use it when I'm making a presentation doing a webinar you know or um uh coaching people before I coach before I do my work I always shift into a finer self um and I do I do it as two sets you know so I'm using some of the old work and the new work you know the old work was ten percent more of you know this energy coming through this finer Dimension whatever and, um and where as you go you said in the past that women are more um spacious or and men are more uh centered or yeah don't say that in 100 way people it's just a generality a generality but I felt it true for me so what I do is ten percent as I go 10 20 I do the up down you know for the first for the first round and in the second round that's when I start uh the spaciousness of it and I and I find that my performance is much better coaching or giving a speech or whatever I also use it when I go to the dentist or a body worker or the doctor when I have to go through some procedure you know I open up to this finer self that could handle the energy that you know that, anxiety that I might start feeling initially you know so and allow the whatever the doctor is doing to me or the dentist's doing to me to kind of take hold in my system in a harmonious way yeah thank you yeah is uh Florida the flutist on tonight no she's not no I don't think so okay, well thank you gonna have a, musician say something we got quite a few people out tonight so uh for some reason oh okay let's see so, I used to like walking I used to do it as again as an inner practice go for a walk and at first you're just checking out the body and getting forward present and better body basic but then as soon as possible more inner work more inner work more inner work so I had a particular Block in uh where was I then Mountain View or I'd walk around this long Pleasant block of nice trees and stuff a quiet neighborhood and, just practice inner stuff while I was walking I, found it fun ah Susan gets stuck in a snowstorm Susan on yeah she's here see if she can come on yes attention yeah is that you can you hear me yeah yes she's pretty clear any comments on you're the wood Chopper and okay so there's the physical activity and the inner work that you do while you're doing that first is the my up down line up and next is the character of the wood Chopper, and allowing that wood Chopper character to fully develop Ed um there's obviously the wood shop and then yeah and then self and I might play with it differently different time so I might start with self um or other times start with the wood Chopper, and then um not focus on but allow self to show okay let me let me jump in so people be clear that she's pretty clear sometimes she works to continuing character wood Chopper and the finer dimension of character wood shopper and however it shows itself in a finer Dimension okay uh sometimes she does this and she says she wants to reference self okay there so uh you can do that uh I wouldn't bounce around too fast and try to get all of them at the same time or too soon I wouldn't flutter it up because again I don't want you to smear it or what's our word smudge it I, wouldn't want you to smudge these things uh so generally speaking I would stay on, one if you're working a character stay with character continue with character for that whole session okay NADA you gotta do it this way only but it's kind of neat just stay with that and then another section if you feel like self wants to show for whatever reason why you're chopping wood then you know you're going to do self and stay with that stay with that for quite a while I think it's, a good trick uh just so you don't bounce around too fast and start to get smudgy and get confused between who's who and what's what here did I say that okay did I say that in a nice way you did oh good yes you did I'm trying to be nice people make it hard for me I will admit I have occasionally smudged haven't we all okay, uh a teacher we're talking a little bit about music anything you want to jump in as going inner as a musician sure, um it's, interesting isn't it that um that being a musician there's a there's a, few different things going on, you have the music that you're playing and then you have uh that's connected with the technique uh of you your ability to play or your ability to express that one of the things that I've noticed over time with some folks is they give extra uh emphasis to technique and in, a in some ways they you, give up the soul of the music you give up the spirit of the music hold it there Keisha let's, clarify that for the folks no and correct me if I heard you're wrong all right let's say all musicians or most all musicians, settle inner to some degree okay yes and then they play something okay and then they start to put more time on what they played and maybe even forget it was the inner that got into that level to play that they started majoring in their in what they played and they go out, they got off the train and they're spending their lifetime in this little town which was just had a momentary attraction it wasn't meant for you to spend your life in this little town, kind of thing is that did I catch that right yeah I think so you know I think a musician is complicated at times because you have to spend some time in development you know just like an Aikido or any in, dancing and acting you're working with you're working with some technique but when I think what you were pointing to Sensei was just when you over emphasize the technique and kind of lose connection with the soul or the spirit of your expression or of the music itself yeah, so uh I don't know yes, on that whatever that is yes, but it came from here and as this gets a bit better yes gets better and you don't ever forget that back to the inner I've had something to it that kind of thing that, you have to decide how much inner how much outer okay well at us at a certain point when you give over to the to this excuse me to the spirit or the soul of the music and the expression it also carries the technique to a new level so uh so uh there needs to be a balance of what called you the, spirit of the I guess we could say the spirit of the music or the or your self expression of that music carries technique to a new level step you you'll experience the playing with the expression of the music in a way that you could never have just practiced for, and I'm liking right now this thing that jumped in at me was the inner musician hmm so that people don't get too confused with the spirit of music oh the spirit of music and then the inner musician here he's a bit of a Claude okay easy settled open he's still cloudy but there's a touch of smoothness in there okay and you're playing and you heard it you tape it whatever continue easy the inner musician he'll play and he plays different yeah so I like inner musician I want people to get lost in the spirit of music and the oh that's me yeah I I'm tracking you on that yeah sure the um okay the, inner musician at a certain point in a way that we've talked about over uh the last couple of years here how long has it been now that we've been doing these sessions there's, a way in which you easy the eye Which is far deeper than what it initially seems like because you're letting go letting go the inner musician here you let go to the inner Muse to the inner musician and you know I'm calling that the spirit of the music but you can call it the, inner musician there too that uh that starts to open up and express the um the beauty the express the quality that is uh there to be expressed so that letting go is an important thing you have to let go of the practicer to, to, reveal the performer maybe it's similar to what Susan was talking about when she was mentioning the development from character or and then letting go into this end itself that's another level, yeah what was coming to me then was a musician would probably run into the vibration, vibrational sense of things which is not the character per se now but just at that level good character but the world is in is vibrational is that okay word for musician vibration, frequency you know those things yeah, it's that when we were doing this practice here you were you were also talking about feeling not just inside the skin but feeling the space feeling the qualities of up and down um energies moving feeling the design of how things work yeah, yeah, so some, musicians kind of uh buy luck or whatever find their way into that space that space don't know how to get there again but when we're when we're practicing like we're practicing now you get to know the, map or the design the construct of, of the how the How the Universe works and how, your own system works how you can let go into the deeper finer yeah that's right I like sort of mapping uh, in that it helps you because we are going to get whatever pushed out into heavier but to have a sense of things can help you get back to your inner finer being you know I end up in Bobby sometimes I kind of know the basic rules to get back to Robert, tonado you know so that's nice for daily life to, to, to know where you're at and have some tricks of how it works to get back to the better of you the more of you the finer of you and then to begin to particularize you need a character RDA is itself time to want to be president show uh whatever space helps okay hard for this guy to move into finer because he's here in the finders here so to know space is a good trick easy this more room here easy and in more room more room here easy and in more room this body is free here so the character can start to show in my room self space itself are really close buddies I mean they all are but space itself are very close so they make a nice combo yeah great okay uh I would I would offer one other thing in, since we're talking a little bit about, this in relationship to Performance I remember I remember um probably it was late or mid 80s and I was doing a album release party at the Great American Music Hall and you were there and I was really feeling like this is an important performance and, the energy was really coming up and, uh, you know kind of giving me butterflies or giving me you know like uh anxiety and the what you did with me backstage was okay settled, it down and the, energy is your ally can you allow that so I think that's part of this uh process that um we're talking about I think we mentioned it tonight on that I mentioned for a moment uh don't forget in settling opening that we're really calling up more energies making ourselves available or anyway the more energies will show and, make sure you know how to open and stuff because you don't want those more energies to make you anxious push your shoulders up tighter whatever excuse me I thank you thank you very much great uh and Autumn make sure you got that down pat stage fright any kind of anxiety it's just more energies have it down pat how to open uh how to open before time to uh I don't know get the channels open to get used to opening up the channels for more so and more it's suddenly there it's old hat here you're already open to them, you know it's, easier uh but if you've never opened your channel so to speak and that energy starts pushing through Oh weird can happen so uh a part of what we do in Aikido is uh let me borrow just for a reference uh so he squeezes my arm okay ah and just because that situation is pressuring there's some energy reaction here easy ah there it is okay now I let that energy okay now he moves at me with more push grab okay easy I'm opening up to more energy push grab I got a little reaction there one more easy open I love the energies oh here we go got him okay, uh so what, we're doing is uh playing this game of being attacked God forbid but yeah it's a good it's a good practice because it doesn't have to be a physical attack it's, a situation happening it calls up energy that's all period pool so we practice opening and being okay with the energy so that no matter what the situation is we've opened up our channels so whether it's an earthquake or a uh partner spouse uh same thing although I'm gonna react and you're not allowed to punch out the spouse either side anymore okay uh whatever, so a lot of our work is uh is uh cleaning we're like doing rotor, rooter work we're just kind of cleaning those pipelines out and we do it as a game we do it purposefully okay uh so that's one simple way of looking at, I don't function better in daily life no situations call up energy if you don't have any practice or recognition or how it works you're probably going to screw up a lot of the times now and then you'll do a magic thing but you won't know how it worked or how to get back to that level again so that's a simple basic, situation you're getting energies okay kind of like keeping I don't know the channel Twitter and keeping the um like um like I don't know a certain level of strength and openness okay go over that again where are we what's happening what's the situation well what you're talking about like on set or on um on stage something magical can happen when like the space is opening and you're kind of creating the environment the situation and the circumstances to live and you're opening and you're opening and you're opening and you're opening but if you're not kind of used to that level of strength as well then, maybe you know something might bump you out or, push you out and you wouldn't know necessarily either how to get back or how to do it on your own or that kind of thing, I think with practice and say okay you know and ourselves and maybe in certain cases where you're on stage which is different than in front of a camera where you can control things a bit better uh you can see I need a five minute break can't do that on stage right uh anyway where was I driving that loss that you can I don't know feel that you're being overwhelmed but you have the ability of controlling it a little bit, okay uh I don't know how to say that well you don't have to go crazy on stage no matter how much energy hits you, have a little ability to I'm not saying it well yeah I had I had an experience of it that um I think uh speaks to that it was during the Aikido Retreat we used to have a talents show at the end of the um Aikido Retreat and I was singing The Rose, um and I had practiced it I knew the words I knew the music I mean I really practiced, I go to sing it and about a little bit in I realized that I wasn't singing it the way that I had practiced the words were right you know the pitch was right all of that but the but the, what I was um uh emphasizing or the or the uh the way I was phrasing was different and I got scared because I wasn't in control but I couldn't call a do-over so what I had to do was just settle and just go with that flow just open to it and go with the flow and trust it and um I didn't I didn't know if I was doing a good performance or a bad performance I wasn't even thinking about that I was I wasn't even thinking about that I was just in the flow letting it out the way it was coming out and at the end of the song you ran up on the stage and you picked me up and you hugged me and I realized that you had seen the shift the energy shift in me and you were letting me know was a good job yeah, Autumn I don't know if any of that help come back at me another time uh, thank you thank you Amy uh, okay so if Roy were here I'd have him talk about his walking we talked a little bit to Susan about Wood shopping swimming, um oh vehicle you know when I used to practice a lot pretty good at it while I was driving my car when I was in my car it okay give an example I never put the car radio on because I was always doing some kind of inner work so I was called my car radios virgins because they had never been turned on so at first in the car driving it would just be settling with the car feeling the car after a bit feeling the four wheels that's being individual okay if this front wheel is going bing, the back wheel is doing something a little bit different and just, settling down and feeling that okay and then uh continuing so my relationship with the car was a, beginning to be a blending Harmony of like Oneness okay then continuing because there's traffic and stuff around you have to be aware of that uh was a the next size of it which would include the road itself and the activity the other cards on the road so I could be intermeditating still present fully and aware fully uh so I would do things like, that uh and I do some long drives that are not longing hour, and a half two hours go work with my brother and uh and for that whole time it was just inner work so driving was my vehicle for inner work okay, yeah I really like that one I loved driving down the Big Sur because it's the Coast Highway and some of the old cars I had but they all feel like sports cars on that Highway because I, do that I would settle with the car me in the car and the four wheels and any junk car I had felt like a sports car sports car tuner on those curves it was great I loved it uh so anything is game Swimming is game driving your car it's game anything is game you want to fill that in something you use we're gonna maybe invite Noah to talk a little bit about his Tai Chi party Bob you got something on Tai Chi here uh yes it's a uh one thing that came out after we talked about this a little bit during the week and it's easy when you've been doing something for a long time that has kind of a meditative feeling to it to just sort of be at whatever level you kind of are, and then their inner development really begins to stop okay let's, create a phrase here uh, a natural comfortable level yes make it comfortable and then again stopping so a year later you're still at that same level I, I'm sideline here for a second uh when they travel around the world checking in Aikido stuff and I'd see some of the same people five years later or whatever and sometimes I'd say no development at all and I'd say what the hell have they been doing for five years my God uh there was no change yeah I'm sorry go ahead you're on well I remember uh just a sideline when you uh first came back from Japan and you were teaching and then you went back to Japan for a while and the guys there said Gee we thought we'd be better than you are because we've been training and you've been teaching lately but you continue to develop and they noticed that yeah, that was uh, Henry Kono I think to me because I've been in the states for a year and there's no, teachers really uh and currently a couple of students like you know sort of fairly new still uh so I've been gone for over a year and as he said they've been training at home to Gojo every day you know they're diligent trainers it's a Henry Connor every day uh and, uh so I get back and, he, had to tell me that, they thought they're going to eat me up or something and they were competitive in those days and it wasn't so but while I was here I was doing a lot of inner work I didn't have the outer technical guys to work with doing a little bit new people uh but I was continuing my inner work so, yeah anyway so thanks for reminding me about that story yeah so what should we do here Bob about hitting this uh Plateau this comfortable level and, you're, you're doing pretty good movements or playing pretty, good movements or playing pretty good whatever you're swimming pretty whatever uh how do we push through that and say okay next to you what do we what do we use here what phrase that you've used before that I actually worked on quite a bit this week is what is this really so you get to a level and you feel pretty good and you think okay well what is it really no matter how good you may be you can always ask that question and if you do and you pay attention more is going to come through every time every time okay just really yeah so at this yeah I think we did it you probably didn't catch it people but I think they really did this uh hand uh practice and you feel easy settle a bit put it out again okay and then we reached a certain level of, uh, you started getting past the uh physical feeling level and I threw out the question used to be an arm what is it now, and that was the trick of moving into another level with that with that practice, did I say that right yeah used to be an arm what is it now also another trigger is not to look oh it's a physical arm well what is it now it still looks like a physical Arc to me uh so part of it was also taking your eyes off okay this that used to be an arm in finer, what is it now I'm very hearing a word extension it's an extension okay fine it's an extension easy, I accept that easy what is it now finding your inferring finder it sounds like it's checking out things I think it doesn't work but I don't know it uh a scout a checker router uh a sniffer I don't know but anyway yeah what, is it yes, it's that at that level that's the reality at that level, that's the reality at that level but to continue so things like that what is it really in a finer what is it now in the finer something to keep moving you along anyone else have other words or phrasings for when they want to move past their, comfortable Zone probing being curious I'd say the first word again didn't hear the first one probing like a probing yeah are you talking about my arm thing yes, for sure I'm talking about you yeah what do you use to potentially move into finer if you think you're getting staid SDA ideas it's not a word State yeah yoga I use yoga myself okay yoga is your vehicle now what do you use when you're at a certain basic level that you get to frequently and, and, so we don't stop at a certain level too soon how do you move into a better level gentle same posture gentleness, I have a certain level of acceptance for, wherever I'm at that level of acceptance is a sort of like a like a, kindness to cells kindness to my uh essence uh, and uh gentle kind what else what else can I say comparison yeah, yeah, yeah, all right moving along what do we got let me check my notes Here read uh together uh Jack Waters using a broken swing just basic up down as his uh vehicle for inner work it's a musical instruments breathing practices of course oh Runners of course runners uh says uh says I'm not a runner I'm hardly a walker these days uh but don't Runners often get to a level where they're blowing along like they're in a flow and they're flowing along they have a word for them and they call it not a flow Runners High that's terrible it's also called being in the zone being in the zone in the zone yeah uh so the in that case the zone is a particular dimensional level and when you hit that zone then that happens where she floats along yeah where you thought you couldn't go any further five minutes ago man you go on and on and on kind of thing yeah, okay so to use things that you like doing running swimming and to uh maybe go a little bit deeper with them so you don't get stuck at this oh here's my nice comfortable place yeah cool but a trick of next or finer or open up some more and what is here at this level kind of thing uh something to click you along okay we're inherently lazy did I say or when we hit a, stopping place we often think that's a permanent stopping place when it's just a stopping place of the moment, okay doesn't mean you have to stop, okay sensei's um Sean here the idea of um getting your wind and then getting your second wind and even in the third wind or fourth wind but you're getting your wind you know that's what's about right yeah, at one level I get winded at another level it breathes a bit better get your second win yeah, basically but just to uh realize the little poppies or vehicles that you use uh can be cool you're gonna do them anyway uh, I, was a little sad uh the first whatever year or two of the Corona thing where the I can open yeah I can't get on the battle whoa, as if they couldn't do anything and I thought can you only do inner work or whatever, you're doing on a mat on the mat can't you pick up something in another form you know you know that you continue inner development or were they missing the map because all they did on the mat was physical exterior so they missed being able to do that, but if they're doing inner then they shouldn't have been bitching about not being able to be on the mat I can accept that a bit of course it's fun to be on the mat yeah it's fun to swim it's fun to run it's fun to play the music whatever, but inner work is inner work and you should be able to pull that off any place anytime and have the ability of moving deeper finer in whatever form you're, using okay, is all I'm saying anything, people anything, anything people anything, you know essentially Bob, here yeah you talked about a woman that oh Sensei really admired who ran kind of like a little knick-knack sort of candy shop I forgot exactly what the business was uh yeah yes sounded, to me in the context of our conversation tonight that she was able to use running that little shop as a form of inner development to the point that it got favorable attention for most essay which means she must have done pretty good, yeah my way of saying that would not knowing her or uh but she probably had a nice inner something in her self Inner Glow something that a Sensei like so here she was just a load lady thing in a nothing little store uh but just boom she was her, uh, so yeah I don't know what to say about that but yeah anything about that's a Tai Chi thing anything did we cut that short did I cut you short on it uh no Sensei it was good it was good okay uh Mark anything from you Ma I see you don't hide there you are mark, yeah hi, you win, that whole um covert thing came along um, I, I, are you still there I'm here I see you yep, um I, was I was actually searching for activities I started shooting hoops uh you know some, things that I, never had done really before but I started shooting basketball hoops yeah, yeah so um initially like a lot of people I was probably I was a bit lost I was like oh God the Aikido club's shut down you know what am I gonna do but um yeah but I found just I'd go out there each day and, just and just um start shooting hoops and, just but I was kind of determined not to do it as a physical activity to try to do it in a way to see how the stuff actually works yeah, yeah I, didn't I didn't want to just go and do another physical thing I, sort of wanted to do this inner stuff to make that improve this activity that I hadn't really done before because naturally I'm, not a but I'm so short I'm not a basketball player at all but um but you know we had a kid's hoop outside and I was like okay yeah I'll go do this but yeah so it came from a different focus it was it was yeah um looking at how, does this inner improve that outer rather than just I'm going to go out there and get better at shooting Hoops yeah, yeah see that there is the critical point critical statement that you have to decide if you want to make that statement there uh so along with what you just said you reminded me uh Stephen Samuels can't see that he's a great artist for those of you know old time Maggie those great artist uh Pottery great Uh Wood stuff beautiful oh there it is if you just hold it up here for example not that they could feel the beautiful coloring texture of the wood but thank you what's up what's up oh thank you I'm getting into one of these pieces you gave me so [Music], yeah anyway uh so whatever he does he's a he does great, work beautiful work and I called on double check with him uh about uh it's also its inner development and he sets that up beforehand before he touches the wood or the pottery or whatever, beforehand he opens up and knows it's going to be inner work he so he approaches it from the get-go as inner work, and then he does his outer I was reminding himself for like a word's inner, work so it's quite likely part of the reason he's uh he's uh master I don't know what word he's a great artist uh because he's working from inner to Outer okay finder the inner better the outer potentially okay now all we're trying to warn people about is yes you got to keep a check on the outer let yes you got to hear the music yes you got to see your product yes, yes it's just some people start to get forget there was an inner and get more carried away with the outer, and that's where we got to say oh they had it they missed it they had it they missed it they had it and they left it uh so what a shame okay so yes being aware whatever measuring the outer yes but it's based on your inner if you're of that ilk that type if that's important to you the inner development inner awareness lose that and get too caught up in, the outcome in the activity uh okay I think you're trying to say that also didn't we ah yeah we talked about the difference between technique and um you know between practicing and performance in that way yeah and, one extra, carrier from inner yeah involvement in outer and then even a little more involvement and you brought up something about ego there I've told you we're dead you remember oh let's see tonight Donald phone call yeah, on our phone call um that sometimes musicians can uh well not just musicians, can uh well not just musicians certainly musicians they uh they, they, get a little taste of it they they're they somehow move across the barrier from technique into, presence or something and they, they, own it they try to own it said oh yeah that's me so they rather than rather than understand that it's the process that, is expressing that they want to own it yeah, they want to own it yeah that will remind me of a quick story here uh against women also Pat me on the back uh excellent in my session it was a pretty good session lock out on the uh veranda finish with the session and one of the attendees comes up to me and says you were great were great but I've already moved from the meeting room to outside I'm getting ready for my coffee and cigarettes yeah I'm shifting back to my more Norm uh so I couldn't say yes I was I saw I, said yes it was it was a great session but I couldn't say yes thank you I was great wasn't I see I couldn't own it that way I, knew that was a misunderstanding trap not to go there right, yeah anything before we finish what are we doing next week this is Justin I'd like to, chime in with something real quick um, that, builds on what, Mark was saying I um so I I've been doing acupuncture for 25 years or so and when I'm at the center um I'll open two or three hundred needles in a day and it's one thing to be, um present with self and then there are finer characters available and going deeper, connecting with the clients and sort of inviting the Accu points to open up Etc et cetera really interesting but at 25 years this is kind of a routine chopping wood sort of thing what I really love about this inner development work is taking it into some novel unique one-off kind of thing like I had as an example quick I had a group of friends who were going to run What's called the Ragnar relay it's a 200 mile relay race and they say we're short a team member you've got to join our team you're an Aikido person you're fit you'll do fine okay I don't run but uh they said don't worry it's in six weeks so here I got a train to basically run a marathon broken into three parts you're running 200 miles I've got six weeks to train and it was the inner work of finer character the running character et cetera that really carried me through and um and um you know and the, things that come up as you're in this situation really teach you about themselves I don't have to know how to be a long-distance Runner but being in that character it, informed me the self who's showing up about itself yeah and I did I did fine yeah the inner Runner is intelligent if you give them the room and allow them to be there the inner Runners knows quite a lot about this or what, whatever yeah uh quick aside uh what's up uh with uh visiting George Leonard at his house in uh Mill Valley uh and uh out of the blue he said oh me and a few people are going to go for a run over Mount Tam you know come and I'm wearing my really Street shoes I mean you know real dress Street shoes I go oh my God plus I'm not even in those days I wasn't a runner you know I moved pretty well into Dojo but after that forget it forget it but I, had to do what you had to do was to go click, and I ran that damn Mountain I wasn't going to fade you know damn you George but it was the inner ability that allowed that to go on uh pretty good you probably did pretty good in the race yeah in the Run I did I had a fantastic time um and you know an interesting thing about that as an aside to this aside is invariably during this kind of thing you're going to be three o'clock in the morning in the middle of nowhere and you just got to get out and run 10 miles or something like that and it comes down to um just choosing to take the next step you might want to give up you might be tired you're in the middle of nowhere you, just choose to keep going and you show up you're present and it's it just it all unfolds perfectly yeah quick I have to do another side I bumped into a few Through The Years a few uh guys who'd been in the military and even though they may not have liked the military they did like that they got pushed in the training and what they learned was when they were tired and ready to give up they were forced so to speak to keep going but they broke through to another level and the ones I talked to that caught that were very grateful that they had gone through that, training not knowing that they could go through to another level my words to another level my words to another level uh but, they all said that was that was cool that was cool because it wasn't their Norm you see their Norm was to stop at comfortableness or stop that tiredness or whatever stop at boredom whatever, don't stop continue that's it tonight people that's it uh next week yeah okay uh we're finishing up the year I don't know maybe we'll just let you Dialogue on what the hell you got out of a Year's worth here uh we'll see something, okay thank you Sensei thanks for sounds good Sensei all right see you next week thank you thank you Sensei thank you everybody thanks see you next week foreign

don't let it show in its full list because you're saying well who's in there, and so you got space trying to talk and a character or self or the design is trying to show and else kind of smudges so when you're clear on whose turn it is so to speak uh it's easier for those to unfold unveil themselves explain themselves so you can experience them better I don't know if I said it right but best I can do at the moment foreign somebody help where'd you get out of it out of this year or whatever yeah we laid out a lot of stuff uh Sensei Bob here one major thing I got is the continual and very necessary emphasis that the only path to success with this is focusing on experience and not on just awareness I actually major and I don't think that as many times as I mentioned it I think we can say it again and come around at it again it's a major a major lacking a lot of okay too many cases uh, uh the awareness seems to dominate and, people don't catch that it has for lack of words another half to it which is the experience of that okay and that's critical, if it's just awareness eventually you get spun you can't retain the levels you're at you get sort of Spun uh back to a lesser level uh to be more complete in this click, click approach to your more original Self uh the awareness and the experience the experience and the awareness as, one unit will really facilitate we have to go over that again because it's, still I have a feeling it's still sometimes not quite caught that the awareness takes over again and yes, I'm aware there is a word called experience I'm aware of that so I'm experiencing no you're not you're yeah you know not quite yet I try to lay that out with dumb examples uh getting close to the bathtub you're aware bathtub is important you make an approach on a bathtub okay bear with me make an approach on the bathtub and as you get sort of close the, Heat, foreign you can feel the heat you feel a little moisture so in your awareness you're getting a little experience and you think I'm experiencing not yet we want you for using this dumb example to sit in the hot tub really melt in the hot tub be the hot water of the hot tub through your whole system is something more like, that okay so even if you think you're experiencing or lack the words double check yeah triple check okay because that damn awareness major is a historical problem it started early in creation and it's like we haven't gotten over it, still carries down the line, okay, thank you Bill it's easy even if you get a piece of experience to backslide oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah, right yeah right yeah, a lot of the problems with the experience [Applause] are for like Words having a bad rapport with whatever qualities or type of energies are trying to show okay, and, you might have a personal ad about that energy maybe it's based on reincarnation in the previous life you got I don't know, tortured or something and that energy is kind of will kind of kick that flavor back a bit back a bit uh the dumb, example I'm sorry for someone better uh anyway a lot of music carry over from past lives if you're into past life uh another one is your child upbringing uh where certain things aren't allowed in certain families okay maybe uh maybe being strong dumb example but maybe being strong just I'm strong maybe in certain families that's not allowed no sunstrong people are pushy people we don't want to be pushy people you must be soft be nice and soft and here's a kid who needs this energy to be present firm and to continue to develop, and it's not allowed in his family and he's been instilled with the idea that's a bad thing so how can this kid later invited and say show me the more of you I want to soak in you I want to really inhale you slurper you uh he's hard-pressed because his family said ah not that one so we have different reasons uh so that, that's your trip practice Journey okay I've tried to explain that with again these dumb examples that I use you know uh the snake pit is a good one uh sitting on a snake uh pit uh and, feeling it I don't like snakes okay the only reason I kept it up was I was in my sitting room sitting here hoping it would be okay and as I settle and continued settling in for the next final Dimension ah still snakes but they weren't biting me as I continued easy settle since a finer Dimension uh the snakes started to smile continued finer Dimension ah and then they weren't snakes anymore they were spiraling energies well I had a sense about energies by that time aha they're just energies on the move then I went finer and finer and there was a beautiful Source where they were emanating from ah, that's as far as I could go at that time but you gotta sit on your own so to speak you got to sit on your own snake pit and not figure it out but settle and open and let it clarify itself, okay, as you settle and open uh infers a finer Dimension it's has a room there to show the truer nature of itself they weren't snakes biting hating me only at a heavier level yeah, it was true at that heavier level but it wasn't the truth the truth the truth so basically that's it when you run into a problem let me figure out this problem let me see if my parents screwed me over yeah to touch on that maybe but to actually sit and allow and open and inquire, hi what's your true nature who are you really uh what are you going to do for me if I open and allow you and stuff like that little games you can play anyway if we have to come around on, uh on those kinds of things again very basic very important somebody where are we hey Bob Steve here Steve yeah no I've been hearing a lot of things everything I think somebody has said before me uh Rings, true for me as well um you know I like what, Justin was saying how you really have laid out the, schematas so, to speak of the four the four parts um and uh you know Dusty was talking about uniqueness every uh you know my path is going to be my own path it's you know it's even though I have a great deal of admiration for you Bob I'm not going to do it your way and I, can't I'm not all sensei we're very similar though so that helps but I can't try to be oh Sensei yeah as much as we're kind of similar and I really dig them uh what's his sense of the pattern now can I utilize that for me to find me yeah at the level that he found himself whoa big jump here but, yeah we're all individual here you all got your own path yeah and it throws you back to yourself and to become more trusting of your way your the things that arise in your system um and like, Bob Noah was saying uh about the experience I guess for me the, two words and you've mentioned this early on are our patience and Trust um because I'm not going to experience it right away but that doesn't mean oh nothing's happening it means okay yeah I'm aware but I know that by sitting and being patient the, experience will emerge uh and I don't have to get in my own way that way I just allow it yeah and let me clarify a bit not just okay I'm just going to sit here until God touches me on the shoulder and explains everything it's not a nothing there's a for again the basic settling opening, some sense of inviting hey I know you're here could you show yourself and talk to me and, and be more present so I can pick it up at my stupid level or whatever, find your own words your own little tricks but they're all kind of based on, that yeah, and, the um you talked about the uh, thinking uh feeling sense feeling sensing and I, can actually as I'm doing the process notice where I am along that, uh you know road map yeah so uh a fairly easy one really with total practice right yeah I'm thinking it's very clear what I'm thinking, when I begin to feel and it's some feeling and some thinking some thinking some feeling I, know I'm got both of those going on as I continue more feeling and suddenly the thinking is very quiet I have to make an effort to think well that means I'm at the feeling or finer feeling level and it just is not there you don't stay in the thinking people you're not saying the thinking realm trying to quiet it down it's a pinball machine kind of instead of bing, bing, bing uh you settle to a finer dimension of finer feeling let's say following that thinking feeling finer feelings directional map whatever, uh where you're at that level thinking doesn't go on heavily after that ping pong style at that level you don't stay at that level and try to control it that way yeah, okay yeah no it's just a nice uh way to kind of gauge where you are along the way by, delineating each of those, uh parts or not Parts but uh experiences or yeah just try to help people realize it's not just well I don't know chaotic uh that there are certain patterns yeah and that's what I try to lay out by mapping certain patterns at certain levels certain things start to show you know at a certain level of settling uh, when feeling at a certain level where my fingers start to get warm they start to tingle they start to glow and flow a bit I said oh that's a nice level for a piano player or a guitar Strummer area yeah okay at least that level at least if that makes you a better plucker of strings, good let's hang out there for a bit and get some experience but as soon as possible when you're of mine too let's move into the next dimensional level following that lineage see what the next one is so that's what I try to do I try to map it out yeah not just so you can be aware of it hoping you will experience these levels on the map I'm just grateful for these sessions they really you know for somebody who's miles away from you and yet we can hang out every Friday uh I really uh I relish this, thank you, know what I was going to ask tonight but it's a quiet night what's our count we're at 26. a bit low 26. usually you hear the same people speak no problem but there are people out there I probably don't even know who you are where you're at with this stuff why you involve yourself Friday nights to, get involved watch this stuff who are you could I hear from somebody or some people uh just who they are why they're here I know you're the shy ones that's why I haven't heard from you but just, a little in intro who are you or what do you do for a living what's your interest especially here on Friday night uh and you put it any of you shy ones out there want to jump in was that a prep for somebody hello yes this is Russ IA, Ross we all know who you are I don't know if I'm talking to you I'm sorry I usually don't talk that much so let me tell you what I the things that, were the most impressive to me this year was, I got a lot out of uh being okay with darkness and, experiencing it and working with it uh as sort of a friend um, as opposed to like thinking that something's wrong when things are dark so, that was that and I think I called you right after that and I told you that I I'd really like that class because um a lot of times when you know some and for me A lot of times these uh Darkness will show up while I'm asleep I'll, just have dark images while I'm sleeping in you know when I wake up sometimes it's like oh well that was weird you know but if you if you sort of sit with them and let them be part of the space of let's say I then meditate and, hang out with them and it's like they're usually helpful in some way they're, actually friendly but they're, actually friendly but they're not friendly if I if I take them at face value and I look at the darkness of it that's one thing but if I let them sort of Express themselves more deeply it's, fine so I that was something that I got very much from this year what one way we could look at this down dark time dark time is it's of the same family of a trade-in it's in the same family as uh letting go okay, but there's a couple of major places along the way where it'll show as dark okay um and for you definitely not to be afraid of it so what he's doing getting more comfortable with just accepting dark and again in more room let the dark be there showing them more of itself and after a while you can here as you get more sensing here with the dark has to say about itself what its job or purpose is so you got a chance to, understand things a direct communication with the thing uh so uh dark is kind of uh important big time and what about the doctor's book Dr uh, Alexander even, Alexander and he had those two in the book I believe there was two contacts with the dark and his first one was icky there's icky stuffs going on it was a dark swampy kind of thing yeah he wanted out and as soon as he said I want out of here then of course Bing he's brought to a finer awareness level and then he does something there whatever then he comes back eventually to Dart but it's at a finer level how do we know because it's not icky it's acceptable don't know if he loved it I'd have to read what he said but, it's not icky he's it's kind of okay and he's hanging out with it and, being present there with it uh so for it to go from icky to hey it's okay something interesting here hang out and there's more uh but that's just a dimensional change so if you're gonna play with something I have a little more room so the truer nature of whatever it is can show whether they're snakes will show his energy or icky dark will show us something that's kind of natural and useful and useful and can be utilized to really move along because uh because it can quickly move you through many dimensions to a finer dimension okay uh so many of you are probably bumped into potentially a good sized dark when you pass over okay uh and to be not afraid of it bursting it oh okay I'll take the ride and you experience the dark and it'll bring you to a finer level and you can click Bing and start to open up and light up and you're at a whole different level and then establish yourself at that level so it may show up uh, at a at a crossing over gets time not necessarily guaranteed but so often you ought to be aware of it so it doesn't scare you okay did I say that well I hope so anyway uh anyone out there who wants to introduce themselves who comes on the show frequently but has never said anything this is Linda another one I know um do you know me oh wait a minute there this is a different Linda yeah oh this Linda okay they threw me off Linda because they got Linda earthman's picture up in the corner and I was going to say not Linda again, hi Linda waiting behind the flower the reason that I come is because I feel a part of your lineage having Noah Sensei as my Sensei and he haven't been taught by you and you haven't been taught by osensei it feels like a direct you know like I got a direct line or something there's that and, I, like there's something about you that I, really like so let me let me call my wife into the room and uh and you can tell her how many things you like about me, I'm sure she knows and uh so what I've gotten for me I'm um when I see you make your you would make a move that you when someone is posing a question or you're getting something from yourself you make a move that kind of, settles you and you always say settle settles you and you always say settle you say that a lot and, I think that's what you're doing and I think you're doing what you have been teaching us and that's what I that's where I'm getting my, input is when I see what you're doing in, that sort of ethereal sense that that's where I get okay that's what it is I see that whether I do it or not you know well Step One is say hey there's something there step two is let me try a little bit of doing that something that's there that's, the norm that's the norm thank you uh thank you yeah any, kind of settling to facilitate moving into a finer Dimension so whether uh hey, or whether you use a breath beat to do that, or whether you're uh alone you like to make sounds here ah [Music] oh, ah oh ah oh whatever form grabs you there are many forms, but many of them are trying to do the same thing okay and a lot of people don't know that so they'll say you don't make sound you're never gonna make it kid because you're supposed to make sounds in my school we just make sounds uh and it's like yeah you can make sounds you give me little hand movements you can uh bend over and straighten up whatever as long as you're full in the style that you're using and that uh feels natural and comfortable for you and to be ready for changes okay that something that feels good and you do let's say every day or whatever uh and it really works for you boom brings you to a better location let's say okay better sense of self let's say uh but there could come a time in a month six months even to get whatever where Suddenly It's it kind of dries up and it's not there don't panic don't panic might be another aspect it wants to show okay so the patience again trusting you're still on the path can we call it the path you're still on the path uh you've done very well with that style could I say now easy something else wants to show easy I haven't done so I'll guess what it is I'm just gonna hang out and something's trying to show easy open don't try to out think it easy open and then and then it starts to be there and clarify itself more and more I think uh Steve uh mentioned that little piece there anyway something like, that so be don't be shocked if your favorite Style suddenly seems to run dry or stop it's okay there'll be something else that's apparently a little better for you or next in your system and I think next, uh so I used to love to chat um, and then reached a point where I didn't feel like chanting uh been chant for a long time or ring the gongs I love the ring the gongs okay gongs okay one of my best afternoons was in Kyoto visiting a Gong shop all these bells and thongs and walking around gonging and listening to the vibe and the owner caught, we were Kindred souls and he smiled at me and came over and the both of us were walking through the store going in different gongs and if we hit a bad one that wasn't didn't resonate really nice he'd give me candy and I look at him uh so we're like compatriots going through his gong shotgun I loved it I loved it uh but after few years whatever wasn't there for me okay chanting's coming back lately I'm feeling the urge and I throw out a couple of sounds now and then during the week uh so maybe I'll get back a bit to chanting but at the level I'm at now anyway so uh, so don't be shocked if your favorite whatever Runs Dry Don't Panic you're not doing anything wrong it's just next, okay it will unfold don't panic be easy continue it opening allowing it will clarify things aren't really being purposefully hidden from you if you're coming too thick and heavy you can't see well that's because you're thick and heavy easy settle open everything wants to unfold that's the nature of the Beast of creation that does want to unfold okay it doesn't really want to stay hidden, uh but we come in at things sometimes heavy and the finer of things can't show because I have heavy eyes and easy yeah okay A little trick of the trade yeah uh, uh, what's your you have a job a business uh, who are you speaking to sensei are you speaking to me yes I, have a job I'm an office manager and a good one cool [Music] yeah this works for any, anything so on an office manager lineage it's the same basic settle in open more room and, the energies will gather because you're lineage at that day that time is I want to be a better office manager or craziness is happening and at the moment I can't cope easy settle open moving into a finer Dimension and in a more open or better energy naturally more in Harmony and they help mix up the office manager Persona person in that situation so it's the same basics they're not attacking you with Yokum and attacks uh but it's the same it's the same yeah thank you yeah and I was I was happy when, people would come to me i.tw students would, come to me i.tw students would come to me and, and say whoa my, uh being an office manager is really improved since I started Aikido I'd always be so happy they're like catching more of the essence than somebody said my yoga man got stronger my caught the guy is she got better yeah that's fine that's fine but, there's, so much more so when people would present those examples I'd be ever so happy okay I had a guy uh I said what's her name it was a big time company oh God I'm not gonna remember the name back in anyway big name company very selective of their employees and he started when he came into Aikido it's like every day when he came in or every time he came in he'd say what do you do against a left hook I said not yet, just train what we're training next time we come in what do you do against a left hook this one I've like three months but in that three-month IBM I think that was the company worked for when they're in their heyday and he came in one day after three months of asking me about the left folks and said whoa he just had a been reviewed by the upper people there and they gave him a great review and they said something like in the last three months he's really, improved let's move this guy along and he knew that was because of his training you never asked me about left hooks again he was so happy to be a bigger man in IBM I loved it all right or the student who uh at the time was a million dollars these days it'd probably be 200 million dollars he was selling real estate and he, reached a peak a million plus whatever when houses were affordable anyway uh and he said he reached that Peak pretty easily uh because of his Aikido training and I said cool that's great that's what I'm looking for my only was he didn't even buy me a cup of coffee laughs, anyway uh so yeah, not just to produce on the mat better we use that as a reference no discussion uh but to develop yourself to, learn the tricks so the inner can begin to show and it is developed it's not like I Bobby stupid ask Bobby have to develop it's hard for Bobby the excuse me idiot uh tough guy to improve but thank God settle and open and whoa, great things are going on you just have to give them room to show that they're there whether it's a finer level of self more space a fuller character it's all there but so we don't have to work so hard to try to create it as if it doesn't exist it's a matter of again trying to keep it short opening so it that that's there in its beauty and Perfection and whatever words you can come up with more and more can show it's there so in, that sense it's simple I know it's a territory of a journey sometimes but in that sense it's also kind of simple let it unfold yeah, this is guaranteed because we in the origin of things we came from, pretty perfect setup and then we got involved with an ever-tightening creation which got heavier I, use kind of tighter as a rep for heavier and here we are almost an ape type person right easy but just backtrack myself easy settle open and it's less ape and more human easy I continue it's a finer level of Being Human some people think I'm nice some people think ah I didn't work to be patient I think of myself as being impatient screw you people, but lo and behold there it is there it was it was always there but I was here easy, and on this movement from here to there a lot of misunderstandings which we're trying to clarify using the map and some tricks of the trade, okay, so for example going from here to here I ran into some snakes whoa but hanging up being patient letting things clarify they weren't snakes they were beautiful energies on the move I like energies on the move yeah and I'm not uh so it should be easier, uh and we should probably highlight that as a class the potential easiness I don't say effortlessness but something uh because of the natural way it was created that we ride the naturalness uh take advantage of it whatever that might be a subject for some class I'm not sure what we're going to do next year uh this weekend I'll, I'll start mulling on where we're going uh thank you somebody another one of the ones I don't know hello out there hey everybody wants to sit in the back row in this class ah the shy ones are shy uh Sensei bought here well the shy people are developing their courage another thing you focused on that I found very helpful is you get to a place that's pretty good better than your Norm even maybe better than most people's norm and then you have a very important decision to make which is it's, possible and desirable to keep going say okay good enough is good enough ah yes, knowing that that's a decision point I think makes it more likely that you'll keep going also I consider their or like Words a calling and inferring self uh that I would like to stop short let's say but I have something in me that calls me and says come on come on so I have a calling or a nag that kind of grads me calls me and I uh and I think some people maybe don't have such an obvious I don't say Advanced self careful Advanced cell uh that more clearly called them uh but if they're interested in development then they have to make that choice again they can't say we're all wait to be called if myself doesn't call me then it's not my time and 20 years later there's I'm waiting for the self to call me because I'm not you know and, they themselves, and if you're really study them there's probably a Fear Factor there's probably, a Fear Factor there's probably some snake pit that they got to go through that they have a misunderstanding about but they won't cop do it because they won't feel experience uh so they'll make up these stories like well God hasn't called me yet I'm waiting for God to call me to call me to call me to call me a bunch of our butterfly floating around what the hell anyway so yes when you hit a place where you feel pretty good nice you can hang there for a bit how long has it been I don't know your call uh now some people at a good place are afraid to continue because they're they don't know what next is and they're afraid they're very good here and if they do anything like that this may disappear and they don't want it to disappear because they're well known for their intelligence their martial art capability their ability to make money whatever, and they're afraid of letting go of that level of esteem and fame whatever, to try for next okay again my calling strong I'm not saying yours on or anything I'm just uh so even if I win the lottery the umpty millions and millions of dollars are giving out is it Lottery big bucks right if you win the big one uh sure as hell I would continue doing what I'm doing okay I want to say oh I've arrived I've got molten multi, Millions I got to spend time deciding what to do with it I don't have time to sit settle and open I've got all these millions uh that wouldn't happen for I know me it would wouldn't happen for I know me it would grab me and pull me again say hey what are you doing enjoying this fine no problem but you don't really shouldn't usually lose that capability if you continue more, okay, okay, but you'll have a better sense of that capability in a better sense uh, I don't know a dumb example is probably not true but let me use oh Sensei being a tough guy okay a defeater of other Warriors and eventually hear him say something like Oh I'm a protector of I stayed on lineage but it went from let's, dump those guys to ah let's protect the universe here or whatever, something like that, uh, Bob you finished well you said that's a kind of along the lines of what you were just saying that in your communication with those sense say he felt that constant pressure to continue to develop that idea very strongly uh that uh it was always there nagging on them yeah one time when he made a big move a big developmental move uh he it was too big uh he thought he was too big so he said uh that's I can't be that or something uh and he said that's the time where he uh he got sick and he almost died and he realized it's because he said oh that's a bit much I, can't be that good or whatever uh, yeah this happened around pre at pre-war iwama during the War uh in the early years of iwama time uh or I believe that, was the timing there, was a big move a massive move anyway so he worked his way through it and made his move he's it was cool he was cool gutier than I am more diligent than I am anyway thank you Bob uh any, strangers want to jump in Stranger Than The Night exchanging glances yeah, who that hi this is uh Aaron um, this is Aaron, Moskowitz um we've actually met before but I've never spoken up in class sorry are you of the Moskowitz Clan I am the masculine's plan yes all right so you're one of the boys I'm one of the boys yes so I uh so I'm, aware of you when you were, smaller yeah exactly yeah you know I remember growing up on that some of the first memories rolling around so absolutely I've been trying directly but I suppose in a way uh you were one hyper sensation as well so um but I know you were um my father's my favorite teacher so yeah I like to join these classes too one of my first students in California yeah, yeah and so as I've been trying to get Nico with uh Richard and um trying to use kind of more um kind of fun like building up the character as I've kind of stepped in on more since I wrote myself teaching some of the kids and um just kind of conjuring out more and your, voice is echoing a bit is there anything you can you can do sorry I've gotten a pair of headphones here is that any better yes it is try again uh testing, one two three and you better it is if, you don't move Aaron we'll be here more clearly so I'm getting some interference yeah I'll stay closer um so kind of conjuring up the right character for, um you know becoming more of a Sensei more of a senior role at the dojo in San Jose, I've been I've been um you know kind of working with that kind of the awareness aspect so it's been very helpful hang on one second he said he was he's developing his character to be stepped into a more senior sort of Sensei role at the dojo so he was talking about classes and, things like that okay so teaching Sensei lineage yeah, the Sensei character, of Sensei yeah same pattern so where, are we are you catching it's the same pattern yes and just kind of I've been noticing kind of a more of awareness as a kind of a side effect of just going deeper Center circles circle, Center just kind of a more General awareness is, taking Roots so yeah uh and I like that one because uh I have a fairly good eye on the map maybe I have a damn good eye on the mat but that's, part of that, finer level of being where you're aware you can see things better you know somebody may make a move and, other practitioners don't notice it but you say no that's, not that's harmful for him that's not his best way of moving or something you get to see things other people can't quite see something like that so that's par for the course that your eye gets better yeah, yeah, cool okay, you're in touch with Mom I am I am in touch with Mom or I'm going to see you in a couple days and down to uh for the holidays so okay thank you thank you very much somebody anybody hello this is Carl I'm here well I major in design and I'm here to get perspective on the process don't look at myself okay design, okay so mostly I'm watching your process and how you're going at it and uh hoping to get some perspective on what I'm doing in my own study my own process uh just to give me a little sense generally what do you design what are you designing I'm looking at the design of creation oh, oh you're going big time here oh okay yeah, what I call construct and uh Samuels like the word and I like the word uh design yeah, yeah that's, my major um I like the way Richard Moon looks at it in what sense oh I'm listening to you because he listens to you basically which aspect did you like with Richard well the three easy uh well not so easy which aspect freestyle, foreign okay it's a big universe it's a big creation a lot of possibilities of variations of things within that yeah yes yeah yes I agree and that's it I think that's what we're here for is uh yeah as your terminology space plus design plus the individual, is the recipe of creation okay thank you yeah thank you and I hope it keeps going these classes are good if they keep showing we'll keep going if there are no other quiet people out there do any of the regulars want to say something Sensei it's Gina so um, I would say my life has really changed in the past year because of this from what I met you to, when the class started I continually used you know just dropping in and getting better at something it was like I had this magic trick and I could get better fast at stuff you know whatever I was doing but this class has really showed me how much more there is out there and that you can have a relationship with before I was just kind of dropping an energy give me a bigger identity and come back and do this thing better but, to be able to really go in and talk to these I don't know what you call them Parts you know I like that a couple of weeks with space and I really at first it was like oh man I'm gonna sit here and there's nothing in space and now I feel like I know some I got a thing going with space here I know yeah, this thing and it's improved my whole life and my health and my eyes and it showed me you told me once I need to see things differently and I've been able to see what I need to see differently and you know all this has been going on I think because of this deeper perspective of these other parts out there it's not just drop in and get better at singing or acting or painting or whatever I'm doing you know so I just have to really thank you because it's been a pretty amazing yeah isn't it kind of a basic we can even use a human level uh there's a stranger which I can't a stranger but you have a cup of coffee they're not quite a stranger not your best friend yet but there's a something and then you go out to dinner and this doctor you start to be friendlier you share more things uh but what's the difference between oh space is empty it's just a stranger but what do you do as an Earth being you spend a little time with you've asked the right questions you feel what they're saying and, suddenly it's, a whole different relationship so I don't kind of see any difference right we even get a small example in the human world I don't know I was a big musher before when you were talking about all the different places to go you know Center Circle I want to do it all I thought you were supposed to do it all in one sitting and it was just it's called smudging that was a big smudger but I also have a serious nag I will say that I may not have a strong stealth but I have a nag man something's nagging okay yeah [Music] so thank you and careful you just said something I thought negative I thought you said I don't have a strong shells did you say that I did because I don't know how could I say that why, because I keep I'm working on self alone you know my first piece was going a couple of weeks with space and now I'm into self and it's I've never really seen it like everybody else seems to so I you know that's them that's them I don't care what's your sense your sense I can kind of hear it talking, you'd think you hear it talking is that what you said okay what's wrong with that I don't know I thought you were supposed to see it and get that if you don't see yourself you are in the wrong church that's supposed to come to my church we see self their church over there hears self that church over there kind of feels it yeah so come on people don't walk into these rules that some people try to pass on see oftentimes they don't know any better and they're having a hell of let's say uh a space searching as example somebody gets into space and the finer of space and the finer dimensions of faith and whoa a whole lot is happening just with that and then they make up a rule if you're not doing space and majoring in space you ain't gonna make it but they've got no sense of character no sense of self no sense of the construct you see but they don't know okay that's why I laid out the four big ones so, you did it naturally get involved in one and think that was it and blocked yourself out from other possibilities and block other people out okay, that again this is very personal your own style uh don't get locked in by what they're doing what's going on within you and if you think you're hearing then see if you can fine tune that or settle double check it more space uh if I could hear better what would I hear easy no makeup stories easy sense hearing finer something like, that yeah uh you know you may have a major and you block it out because of something like that where the other churches don't talk about hearing self uh who gives a just told me to tell you anyway yeah don't, uh thank you thank you don't negate yourself yeah we have enough problems going on with us Bobby adding to the degradation of the NATO lineage uh whatever however to say that uh okay, um, so, two week break I needed oh what was this about okay quickly on, this now [Music], um years ago uh, when my group was young uh it came holiday time and suddenly they started to Grumble about having to go back and visit family and this person said in that person said another person another agreed with them I thought what the hell is that and so we talked about it for a bit uh I think probably won't happen to you if you're getting gray okay but for the little bit younger people they visit family and family remembers them as being the little kid who cracked in his pants at the Thanksgiving dinner table or whatever okay, and we'll mention that or something dumb that the little kid did, or was afraid of or reacted to whatever, and they'll bring it up because it's humorous but in so doing they sort of take this, is a smaller one they sort of take your normal level and they sort of and where they're treating you like the 10 year old okay I know I do that a lot I got a million nephews and some of the ones I was brought up with I lived with my sister and was brought up with many nephews and nieces uh um that I still uh even though they're great here I still kind of see them as being these dumb little kids doing crazy things, and it sort of comes easy to get on them or, to put them down it just happens so uh for you younger people who are going back to visit family uh if that happens in your family be aware they're not really trying to squeeze you in they're just having fun and whatever but you're gonna feel squeezed in and uncomfortable and ah because you don't want to be an eight-year-old okay so, don't forget your a simple process once you realize that's happening make sure you got enough room and be the character and the aliveness that's there of that next level character this, circle instead of that Circle is that was that okay go ahead the other side of the coin is for us older people with nephews and whatever is uh maybe to be a little careful in doing that because it's humorous and easy to do uh knowing that it's not helpful for some people, maybe a counter practice would be to see, the young adult that you remember as a child but see them in a bigger framework hoping that seeing the more room that they're in and facilitate them filling up the more room that you saw them in okay so what if you're young don't let them squash in you've got a process to be okay where their jokes won't bother you because you're so you okay, okay the other side of the coin is the older ones who tend to do this uh change the game just kind of have a, sense of view of them operating from a, finer space there's a lot of power in that transmission okay no I is that okay did you hear that I need confirmation that it came across right, I didn't see a thumbs up yes it did very much so yeah okay I was having a conversation with a student uh exactly along these lines uh about a week ago what can I say what can I say yeah yes it's the holidays good well she was visiting her family uh because of the deaf in the family and, she could feel that but I can't prepped her for it and it didn't happen she was good with it now hmm oh uh Bob I haven't been picking up your calls because it's been funeral week for me also so I understand I'll, call you tomorrow try me my teaching day people are we ready to end the year let's Sensei this is Lauren and I, uh I want to say that this diagram and what you've described you know doesn't just happen, at holiday gatherings um I, can very clearly as we sit here tonight remember being you know 50 and seeing my mother and, reverting others yes like another son and, yet now she's gone of course I miss her because I have no one to play that with and uh and uh and so this is a sort of evolutionary ongoing generational thing it's wonderful what you described I agree with you yeah now you brought that up I remember my all my brothers are older my older brother was very squared away guy in many, ways very capable whatever uh but he's like 40 at least and he's in the house and my mother calls him from the bedroom Artie would you come in here and he went China you know it shook him because he knew by the tone of her, voice she was going to jump on him about something but to see this adult man who's really capable uh get affected by Mom calling him sorry I really do what she said that was funny yeah oh God people thank you thank you have a nice holiday, I don't know where you live but the traffic's been crazy here so watch out for the Shoppers and the skiers and whatever's in your area uh they're not driving as well as I've seen in the past they're a little crazier this year is it just part of the whole world is getting a little tighter crazier probably anyway so be safe thank you so much Sensei and thank you everyone for uh joining us so consistently and uh being with us and being with Sensei like this and uh wishing everybody a happy and healthy New Year and we're off now until January 6th all right so no class next week before Christmas no class the week after before New Year's next class January 6. and, be safe be safe thanks all thank you thank you Sensei thank you thank you and thank you to the team for yeah making all this happen thank you thank you Sensei thank you Lauren and everybody thank you everyone thank you bye,

though. It's been a chaotic couple of weeks, but I'll call you soon. All right. Thank you. Thanks. Good to be here as well, let me say. Really good to be here. Thank you. I thought I saw the name I didn't recognize flash through the screen there. Anyone else uh who is new on autumn there? Great maf somebody. Nobody's new name. I didn't see before. No, I don't see all the names. So, not really. Looks like the regular crew. Oh, the old regulars. Okay., Old regulars. Ah., What's the title? Fire in the belly. Okay., Uh, I've been bumping into that a lot. I think I bumped into it. I skimmed the sports page just to try to keep up with Jack. Uh, and uh, that sort of popped in. I've been read Louis Lam more westerns to put me to sleep at night and that's showing a lot. It crops up in his books there. U so, fire in the belly. Ah., uh a core of n o core. Okay, we quickly, so again we have core now everybody in yoga and pilateses and whatever starting to get aware of core that if they develop their core this from their viewpoint a physical plexus could we say a muscular physical plexus area that it spreads throughout the body and their whole body gets more squared away if they've got a good core. Okay. And then we continue with that sense. But don't get stuck in the matter of it. Let's go finer. Okay. Finer. Then we start to get uh maybe this uh energy sense. Uh why am I blanking? uh this uh, Noah uh the first Chinese tai chi approach to this uh, uh ton thing, this ball of energy in the tummy. What's the what's the words I may be missing at the moment?, I think you just said it. You've got chi and the danten. Okay, donen. So there's some energy or chi force. Okay. Chi is to me just a Japanese a Chinese form of Japanese chi chi. Okay, close enough. Ah, fire in the belly. Fire in the belly., [Music], This is a very important piece. Uh sort of a sense you can have a, an outline of you uh a mental image of you. But if there isn't a core that radiates energy through that level of you, uh you could kind of feel empty, you could kind of feel, although your image of yourself could be very good that you really don't have the for it or the guts for it, we'd say in English. Okay. Uh I think this is a very important piece that we miss a lot. Okay. That we don't utilize. Uh we don't tap it. There's a better word than tap it. If I can find a word. Spark it. Spark it. Ignite it. Activate it. I like that word. uh it's there throughout creation at all the levels but we have to sort of activate it. Okay. All right. It's there but ah boom begin to activate it. Okay. So, uh Bob, we were talking about using the uh Tai Chi form and any anything you want to say? You know what I'm talking about? And then the next level of that, a well-versed Tai Chi practitioner who's wellverted with this inner work. Well, you were talking about core and Pilates as and yoga as being kind of uh from a muscular point of view supporting the spine and, having a strong kind of spinal core., And in Taichi, you have kind of a similar thing where you have acupuncture meridians running up the spine and down the front of the body. And that would be comparable. Okay. Now, at this level, you start to hit another level of this uh, core, fire in the belly, uh this piece that we're talking about tonight. And then there's a level where you're aware there's forces and forces. So, in the Chinese form, forces up and forces down. Uh fine, I might use a uh forces boom, forces out and returning back. I might use it that way, but it'd be very, similar to final effect should be very similar. Uh, a more advanced practitioner, a master or semi master in Tai Chi. Bob, say something about that. Well, first it expands out beyond just the uh energetic version of the spine and then it becomes, as you were saying, kind of going out and going in. you're able to do what the uh they call borrowingqi where you, can you can draw in from all around you and bolster yourself that way. Yeah. Draw in. For me it would be okay. Draw it in to more of its central source finer and boom here it comes again. So I would use that kind of pattern. Boom. those sense of drawing in. Boom. Bang. It responds. Finer level responding. Okay. Right. so now let's be careful. This image shows a little red spot. Probably can't see it on my feet, but little red spot to show fire in the belly. Uh but let's not uh freeze it into here. Okay? Uh I don't want you to go crazy with this. Uh oh, it's here. Uh as we move into settle and open and move into finer source of this energy, I want to call it aliveness a lot tonight. this aliveeness, okay, that uh flows out from inner. This aliveness flows out. This inner glow manifests outward., Okay, so it's inner out. Okay, where am I going? [Applause], That we don't keep it limited here. that later I'd like to add the word instead of a, core or a ball or something. The field of energy that's equal in size to my whole body and then later finer easy settle deeper in first finer and that aliveness of energy fully with the body and is even a bit bigger. It's under the body a bit. It's around the body, but it's from inner. It's from inner. Okay. So, that growth effect. Did I say that? Okay. All right. Where the hell are we now? Ah,, please just spark me. Give me a Chinese something here. Yeah. So uh as uh as, Bob was talking about the ability to extendq chi to extendq chi so it's not just about physical contact it's about energy contact but energy contact that has a dimension or an actual impact on, this domain on the physical domain. So fa so the, fa part from the Chinese uh internal martial arts they're extending chi some teachers and practitioners are able to they're able to move people they're able to move people they're able to you know supposedly knock them over and from a distance so there's a boom potential there's a boom potential yes yeah, since they had a lot of boom I should Okay. And uh, also the another part of that is being able to, connect with people in, in this martial arty way that we're talking about that uh Noah was also referencing to, move the ground underneath them. You so or the experience is like that. The experience is a little bit like the trapoor that you trap door effect that you would do that you could often do in, your edimei and cook pieces. But the connection would just would bounce people out of their uh out of their root. As you get finer and deeper with this, then things that he's talking about this uh, underrooting them or being deeper than just the physical body, it starts to happen at a certain let's call it dimensional level. It's an actual act dimensional level. It's not all idea make believe. Yes., That's really true. Right. If you just appear in the upper half is a lot of idea aware of lower half represents more the, experiential energy. Okay. Boom. All right. Uh so somebody very intellectual might be able to explain a certain way how the great Tai Chi master or sensei or whoever uh how that maybe sort of works but they can't do it with the sense they'll never be able to do it. Okay. That's cuz it comes from, from here. Okay. So, this actual aliveness of the underworld, as you settle and open sense of going deeper in that and tapping a finer level of it. Boom., Boom., Okay. So I'm thinking uh, one thing that staggered me on this was uh some people sometimes we all at some moments or other have a sense of emptiness or uh gee I have a good idea of myself and yeah I can sort of image myself uh but they I ain't got it. It's I'm, not alive. Okay. And there are certain situations where it's nice to have this glowing aliveness., You know, if you have to give a lecture, you don't want to be have some kind of aliveness there. Boom. Okay. Uh so I think it's a piece I don't know what to say that we've been missing or it's time to acknowledge it, put a tap on it, activate it. It's there, but it needs us to, chew it so it can activate. We're, a part of this big game. Okay. All right. I'm just going to wait here and let the great force come and touch me. You're going to wait a long time. If it happens for somebody, it's a very unusual case. And we'd have to see what kind of history they had in past lives, if you're into that, that enabled that to potentially happen cuz that's not the norm. That's a rarity. We have to activate. We have to get involved. We have to participate. Okay., Sensei, could I say one more thing about that?, Go for it. Go for it. So one of my observations around this is that the emphasis on physical technique is, very limited. I believe Noah was kind of pointing to that as well. And having specific practices or exercises uh that activate this the internal the, subtler the, finer the finer deeper experience is what helps one to develop these skills. For normal people, they seem like this is really mystical and they must be some kind of special being. But it is accessible to us if we know what to how to practice. So practicing beyond just the physical technique into the finer deeper and to add to that or maybe hopefully clarify it clarify it you get a little aliveness and you check and you're using techniques physical body using techniques. Okay. Uh and we tend to as a human in the human condition we tend to keep working the techniques and trying to improve the techniques instead of just a quick check. Oh, that was a bit better. Okay, now back to the inner, inner and then after a bit you want to check the outer just, to check. But we go all outer and no inner unfortunately human, habit. Yeah. Is that, that's exactly that's the that's the point and you've made the point also about the connection in ancient times in Japan of the samurai with the with the Zen Buddhists and how they would how they use that time at the monastery for that inner development. So it's not that we're giving up the external but we're, giving up the external but we're balancing it with uh with other you know practices as you were just pointing out that process of referencing practice reference and then u then energy practice. Yeah., Or spiritual practice. Yeah., People get confused. So we could use those sensei again. Oh but he trained for 50 years or 60 years or whatever. And they think of training as doing more and doing it better. Keep repeating it. He was doing inner training and the outer was just an expression of how he had developed inner., All right. But because not enough is said or experienced with the inner, we get carried away with the outer and sort of get misdirected. We're in the wrong, direction. the inner and if it manifests outer a bit better, if you're a nicer person, hey, cool, you're on track and you go finer inner. If you're a real caring being and everyone is affected by your caringness, hey, great. Let's continue. Okay. All right. So, inner, inner and double check outer a bit. Inner,, inner, and double check outer now and then. Something like that. Okay. Whereas in a human condition, they're going to reverse it. Well, I like that you said inner,, inner, and check with outer because we're usually outer. Outer, and rarely inner. So, and, then they, don't even check with inner. They talk about inner. There you go. What drives me crazy? Things like that. What drove sensei crazy? Things like that. Anyway, okay. So, this now uh see how do I want to time this now because we're physical beings obvious whatever. So, our first stab at doing playing with this is physical checks. Okay. All right. We talk about the character. Can we call this character? The character references more energy and can develop a bit better. Okay. References more energy or aliveness and stands better, glows a bit more, whatever, sings better, punches better, loves better, whatever, makes more money, whatever, whatever. What?, Whatever. So this inner aliveness that we all have access to that should be tapped more often is not just physical body. It's a good place to start because we're starting with a lot of physical body. But I'm going to present that also the other main pieces. We talked about four main pieces. Also the space itself is alive. The self itself is alive or has aliveness energies there. Okay. The character same thing of course we're on character to start with and the uh, uh construct design. The design of creation also is alive with itself. So all of them have this underlying have this aliveness within their own structure. Okay. I did, I say that? Did you follow that? Bob gave me the thumbs up, but if I crap in my pants, I think he'll give me the thumbs up. So we'll pass on Bob. Somebody you following me? Okay. Sensei, this is Lauren. I'm following you and I, want to ask you the same question I asked you the other day. Is this is this aliveness what O sensei might have called you know universal key? Yeah., Whatever. See, I just use the word aliveness. You want to call it energy, you want to call it key, you want to call it spirit on the move. Eventually, yes. There is one thing and, because that one thing was there all the next things the big four have a piece of it could we say or are affected by it so they each have their own juice their own aliveness their own energy. Okay. Yeah. Is that okay? Yeah. Uh, but to continue to talk about the original, key, it's a nice concept. Hey, great. But you can't do with that. That's, going crazy up here. But to say, okay, therefore, if I settle and open and there's more juice, it's based on that. It's there. And it's just a matter of me tapping and allowing it and practicing and allowing it. Ah because it's there originally and all the pieces have it. Not just the character body but the self also and the circle also and whatever also. Is that is that cool? Right., Okay., Yes. Thank you. Okay., [Music], And different cultures would probably have different names for this force, this aliveness, this power, this juiciness, this, energy, this key, this chi, this Yeah, but we're Yankees. It's alive. It's juicy. It's Hey. Okay. See, one reason I didn't go crazy with Japanese words when I came back uh and dealing with the Yankees uh was I didn't want them to put themselves down and say it's key. It's what the hell is key? I don't know what key means. It's energy. Oh, energy. Oh, and I don't mean the wires that light up your house. That's an example. Lesser, and lesser example. talking about the energy here, the personal energy, the Elon, the vitality that some people have. Boom. Okay. So, sometimes you get I, didn't want people to get stuck in not understanding a Japanese word. Oh, the Japanese understand key, but I don't. They must have it. I don't. I'm only a dumb American. I didn't want people to go there. So that's why I use Nado language enough that you have to learn my language without going too far in here. Oh, where are we? Where are we? Where am I? Okay. I don't know. Let me stand. You want to stand for a moment and we'll, play. We'll exercise a little bit with this. Yeah., Ah, let's start with uh we'll use breath as a way in. So, let's see. First I like to feel my body and see what state it's in. What, I feel is possible at this moment at this level just so I can reference it later. Okay. Ah here. I'm going to use an Inhale, exhale pattern. Okay, I could also call it trading in, letting go. And this here represents the source. And my source is a bit deeper. I don't want to stop the source here at this thing. Here's the source. Here's the source., uh deeper and it's like it's a deeper pool of energy and from that deeper finer pool it outflows through the body and I pump it a bit to exercise with it and it flows through the body. See down time. There's a little spot down here. Okay. A sense of a finer dimension. A bit. a sense that there's a little more energy available. It's a little finer and, boom, it comes up radiate from internally through the body One way I know I'm on the right track is my back is becoming very alive after actually after the back is alive. Yeah. For example, if I'm in doing back techniques, it'd be very important for me to have an alive back, not become aware of the back there. Okay. That sort of clues me in dumb example maybe. Sorry. finer energies flowing up through the body. the body. I don't mind pumping. I lived in Canada on a farm for a bit and when you pump the water, who had those kind of pumps? uh you didn't get water on the first pump. You had to pump the pump for a bit and then suddenly the water would start gushing. I don't mind pumping oral sense would call it one aspect of Sante call it a gymnasium to me. Okay. So there's a library I'm diverging here. There's a library. laboratory. Fun around, hang out, let it unfold. And a gymnasium. We're doing the sort of the gymnasium major right now. More energy pumping pump something pump something pump something pump something pumping through the body. And if you're thinking then you're not probably picking up too much. I susping I hope you continue settling and finer feeling. I hope we can get to a sensing. Okay. So a lot of this is at a sensing level finer energies. track feels taller. [Music] I feel also notice I'm a little more center. Feel the center a bit better. If there's a dozen other things going on, but just for example, and So, we're using this internal access to more energy or aliveness, whatever you want to call it, and having it activate, show its present, be present, boom, to continue. Uh, and then have you walk into a party and you just walk in the door? A lot of people turn and say, "Oh, who's that?" my uh dumb examples here. Brad, any anything I'm just going to finish with this. Anything on what that's done for you? Well, it's uh just loosening and it's injecting fluid into my muscles. Okay. But tell me, David, tell me about the aliveness factor. Come on, Brad. Boom., Feel more able to move. I'm able to be more, Oh, okay. Yeah, move better. Yeah, Brad has a touch of shyness going. So,, yeah, just be able to move better. Um, I'm better, less stiff. I'm okay. So the level he's talking about the effect is this loosening up of joints and stuff. I mean really we haven't done anything we did, but the joints are loosening as if you've done all kinds of joint work right., Yeah. And I say the first time it was like move, better stretch out traditional sense but then now I'm getting the sense it's almost like the muscles are doing it themselves. It's less me doing something and yeah. So yeah, and that's a good level instead of uh people do warm-ups where they tell the body what to do and they force this thing. And I've heard dumb stories of people hurting themselves doing warm-up exercises. My god, for me a finer level of warm up his body, how do you want to move now? And if it wants to move this way, okay, and I let it move now, excuse me, body, how do you want to move? and it's saying I want to get down a little bit more. Want to go a bit lower and then down. So I let the body dictate its movements as part of mine. So he was he was starting to touch that area. Let's take a pause here. Anyway, there you go. No big shakes, but I just wanted to get a sort of a sense of direction. So tapping a bit deeper. Okay. So again, uh we talked last week about harmony, balance, whatever harmony to get to a certain click and we call that click the opening click. open to a little finer dimension and in the next finer dimension the aliveness that's there the energy that's there the key that's there whatever okay tonight I like aliveness that's there enlivening where are we with this uh Bob Steve, Steve yeah A couple things I note. One, my I felt much more fluid, like unencumbered. Uh I could I could do any at this point feel like I could do anything physically uh without um any strain. Uh felt like I was in the flow. Um, but the other thing I, noticed that was kind of interesting is, that I' I'd looked around and all the objects in my field of vision that I if I focused on some it had its own aliveness., So um it's as if the inner uh connected to the outer in a, much uh stronger way. If you have inner experiential Eventually, you'll say, "Oh, everything else has it, too." Yeah., Yeah., Yeah. Good. You're coming along well there. Yeah. See, when I first bumped into personal energy in my system, I thought I never heard it, talked about to this degree. Maybe it was someplace in the world, but I never heard about it. And I thought, am I the only one or does everyone have this kind of activity possible? And there's a little period of time where I didn't know if I was the only one or if but as you continue and you develop you realize oh they have it too if they learn to use it or whatever. Yeah., So yeah I'm agreeing with you page. Okay. I mentioned last week I know you're on Autumn. Let me see your face., Hi,, I am in the car. Oh, okay. I can't see your face. So, uh I was just using you as an example last week. I think yourself lines up well. I think you've established the, what you wanted to do in this life. So your character is sort of set and has some of the potential abilities or abilities to do your chosen field. Uh but I had that little background feeling that I wonder if she's tapping this aliveness factor enough. I wonder if, she feels like, oh, I don't know. I feel kind of hollow. I don't know better word. Kind of hollow or inadequate or I'm not sure. It's like, no, you set it up really good. I think the missing link is, oh, there is aliveness with all of these. Aliveness of the character, aliveness of the self, uh aliveness in the world you're in and that, they're all connected. Uh so, to tap this as a practice more I thought would be cool for all of us but I just happen to pull you out as an example case. Is that okay? Love it. Yeah, that's good with me. Okay. Somebody want to jump in and say something intelligent while I stagger around with my notes here? Did you get anything out of that little practice we did as a reference practice, we did as a reference practice using breathing as a reference but then trading it in for the energy beats which follow a very similar kind of pattern and the finer of the energy the finer dimension there the energies are finer and can we say stronger for like a word stronger My sense say it's Oliver., Oliver. Um, as I went a little bit deeper with it, I noticed how the aliveness fills out spaces, uh, empty spaces in my body. Yeah., Flows up and through and fills out the empty spaces. And as that happens, similar, to what Steve said, that the, world starts to, show up more alive as well. Each thing seems to be alive. And then I also noticed the space, the aliveness of the space as well. So that kind of showed up quite strongly for me. So, and you don't know when you're funny around with the big floor. Uh again tonight we started with character, the body character and use that at first. Uh but as you progress uh the space may want to say well hey notice me space is uh, dust on tonight. Yeah, I'm here. I just, a just a just a reminder I, asked you last month or whenever uh I thought space was nagging at you uh to pay it some attention and so just a continuation the aliveness that space has with itself whatever that means to you don't get caught up in all the whirly curly cues I'm not interested in the design at that time just in the aliveness in this larger space and the aliveness in this larger space. It'll probably then uh, touch the character and you'll feel a bit better. But I was using the aliveness of the space to then overlay with the character. Hope I didn't confuse you with any of that. No, I appreciate it. I think the space helps create calmness for me. Yeah., there, are many, levels, of vibrations. Okay. Uh so if we're playing with the uh so I'm not sure if that's space or the design of things what whatever, we'll fine-tune this another time. Uh but the beats more in harmony and there is what you say calmness. Yeah., As they're more balanced it's calmer. It's like he she or parents if they're fighting I, would have trouble being calm as a little kid. I can't be calm. They're fighting. Okay. But if they're in agreement and caring and acknowledging each other. Ah, here I am as a little kid. Oh boy. Palmer, cool, whatever. So harmony brings you to particular qualities. Depends on the vibrational rate. Depends, on the vibrational rate. Depends on the dimensional level you're at. Yeah. People. Yeah., And if you've been nervous, let's say, to be able to get to a calm place must be fantastic. Oh my god, I'm not nervous here., Yeah. And the mistake in the human condition is, oh, this is it. Yeah. as if there is no more because you're so happy. The nervous one who can finally tap into the calm space and be able to do it virtually on call. Doesn't take you about a few minutes to set up and bing, there it is again. Calm., Wow, it's miraculous. Don't stop. We're not finished. Enjoy the calmness, sure, but take the next step. If See, I'm, a keep going kind of guy. You know, I'm a nag. People, the people that know me know me. I'm a nag. If they would come to me and say, "Watch watch me do this technique. I can really do it well now." And they're expecting a compliment. Oh, yeah., Now, what's next?, I got to learn to stop there and say, "Oh, that's great." But if I overdo it, it'll increase their tendency to stay at that level. Well, that's nice. Good. Next. Okay,, that's me doing me. Live, with it, people., Okay,, Sensei, I wonder if I could ask, you know, sometimes people when they talk about fire in the belly, they talk about a certain intensity or Yeah.,, you know, you know, it's pretty juicy., And Juicy. And one of the things that you've been talking about just now is uh, don't just be satisfied with calm. There's more., Yeah., To me, fire in the belly is that individual internal desire for more is kind of linked. you know that, the, the determination to keep going for more to, keep practicing if you will in uh belief hope assurance that there is more., Yeah., Kind of fire in the belly, isn't it? Yeah. We could talk different things in Yeah., Yeah., Also, there should be a natural draw, could I say here? Yeah. As you tap it, work it, that it likes being I don't want to say unleashed, being uh, uh presented, Brad, being brought to light, realized, actualized, manifing. Also, if you want to use the, of it as a calling, fine. Yeah. I like calling a lot. I like calling. Thank you. Calling fine. Yeah., Uh and remember there are different we say uh aspects as it flows out. Uh I can get very boom. Somebody has whoa and this massive love. Oh my poor child. Let me hold you. Oh you poor thing. And so there are different forms in which it can show out. Uh um it's not just one thing. We call it energy or aliveness or key or whatever. But, state in its and going from this major to the minors. There's all a variety of miners, power, caring, awareness, whatever. This is a variety of things. Might file that away. If you're going to sing, and you want to get a check, the sense of, the energy aliveness that you're getting to be a better singer. If you're going to uh play the guitar, play that kind sorry, play the piano, uh what kind of energy is coming through you to facilitate that? There'll be little different shadings for each thing., Again, was that said properly? And say, I have a take on that. Uh maybe, something in there. Um, I often tell people when they're looking for that aliveness, it's not always about, amplitude, about the amount, but really the quality of the presence that is there. So, it's not an eitheror things. You can have fire in the belly and it's as a beautiful, Hang on. Somebody's making noise. Who's clearing their desk? Stop it. Sorry, Tia. Go ahead. Okay. Uh just to just to reiterate that about uh amplitude. It's not necessarily about having more and more. Sometimes it is, but there it's, you know, it's about the quality of presence. You can you can communicate tremendous fire in presence just by a look. And um so it's not about not always about just the, explosion of Oh yeah., No, I don't think we meant to present to people that this is explosive., Yeah. No. Yeah. No. Come out in a loving way, in a caring way, and an awareness way in a whatever a singing way, a piano way, a guitar way. And there'll be little variations on how it's coming out for that particular thing. Yeah. There it is. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Uh, I tell my students to be careful of me because I like a bit of the explosive. I showed you the picture I love of go to uprooting the bamboo. I love that Okay. Ah, I love the monster. Okay. If I was into cartoons, I'd love the green. Who's not the jolly green giant? I kind of like him. Hulk. The Hulk. If I were into cartoons, I'd probably love the Hulk. A little aspect of me that tickled me. Okay, that but I tell my students sometimes if I'm using that as an example, don't, use that. Don't worry about that example. I'm not asking you to be the Hulk or Goro. You might ask firmer or something like that. Uh but whatever qualities are coming at you, you're in your own system. These this aliveness is part an original or very originally what your system got created in and there you are. Uh so we each have our variations okay, of qualities and things. There are certain basics the to me the four are basics. It's going to be a character there's definitely a space. There's, definitely a space. There's definitely a self and there's definitely, a self and there's definitely a construct. Now within that your you style your flavor how you present whatever is you is you. Yep. Let me run through some. Okay. Now another problem we have human condition when you're going inner finer you start to get finer than the heavy body outline reference moving in finer. There's still lack of words a body character there but it's like a body energy level character. Uh and then something finer than that character. Uh so I think the people some people might not might lose it when they get past where they can feel the body definite and they start getting finer, again and they think oh there's, no more enlivening of this because I'm past the body now and then they drift off into something else okay where it continues this is the character body not the body continues it dies out but let's say eventually an astral body and eventually that one catches on to the game and moves on to whatever words we're using for the next level of body character but it's ongoing. So watch out in the human condition when things get a bit finer and you uh, uh stop working let's say working energizing that system because the heavier of that system is not there but its system, is not there but its system at that level is there. Okay. If in doing some of my work with other selves, not people, uh when I go finder and finer and, I uh hanging out with a self, checking out a self and if they were to appear to me kind of nice but sort of empty, nothing much going on, I'd have to wonder about their aliveness factor. If they're not alive enough, they might be hampering their character to be alive., Okay? If the self is alive, it facilitates the character being alive. Uh because they all relate to each other and will support each other kind of thing. I'm not watching you with your thumb, Bob. I'm passing on you tonight. Uh oh god. Anyway, we all have access to whatever you want to call it, inner energy, aliveness,, uh keych vitality, halon, we all have access. It behooves us to practice because it's a major major. Okay, it's a major, major major. Okay, it's a major, and whichever aspect you're playing with kind of file away. See again we start because it's more convenient and natural start with physical body and get core energy and physical body and finer energy. Tai Chi master. Whoa. Inner energy. Uh but uh be prepared uh for it to show in the other main pieces that they're all alive. Okay. All right. Their flavor may be a bit different because they're different. I don't know. Become a diagram. You got a diagram of a of a self. You got a diagram of a character. You got a diagram of a of the space. You got a diagram of the workings, the design of creation. Uh there may be a little different flavor with each one of those. It's still alive, but because it's a particular piece of creation, its flavor may be a bit different. So stay alert, get better sensing, soak there for a bit, whatever. Okay. Did I lose you? to go a few minutes. Let me uh I love sensei's uh history. Sorry. I love Okay. So sensei telling me little kid on the Okay. He he's uh he's very natural even as a little kid with the stories and stuff his mom used to tell him about the uh spiritual setup. Okay. Uh, he, liked that, he would sit on her lap, so to speak, and listen to her and all of that. He, liked that piece of it. Okay. That he got from his mother. Okay. Now, when he's about nine, he happens to speak when his father's around that he's thinking he'd like to be a Buddhist priest. Okay. His father, I don't think was anti this, but not quite his thing a certain way. Said, "Ah." And drugg him to the beach. Okay. Now his first goarounds on the beach, he tried to invoke his quote spiritual knowledge. Could we call that the stuff he got from his mother, his belief system? He tried to invoke that cuz he was getting pounded. Okay, remember he was uh he inferred to me, I couldn't quite recall, but that he was probably a very uh creamy preey, preey what's the proper word? Premature baby. Premature. He was probably very premature. So he was very small and very n uh and uh he didn't have much going for him body-wise. So when he says he's thinking about being a Buddhist priest, his father says, "Ah, to the beach you go." So he gets pounded and his beliefs can't seem to help him any. He calls on him for help. Nothing works. But while he's there, he triggers into this inner energy. Okay? He triggers into it and he sort of whatever I don't know naturally allows it whatever degree was there and, the sumo helps just the very posture of sumo probably helped him because it's deeper ground. Boom, boom, boom. Okay. A little bit like we did a bit. a little bit. Okay. So, the form itself probably helped spark, but he also had a sense that just hit him real soon. And with this inner aliveness, very, quickly, shocking to him, shocking to everybody else in town. He made a joke. He said it was like uh using your language being a 90 lb weakling and a couple of weeks later being the winner of the bodybuilding contest. I'm joking but making a point. It was fast. Oh, okay. So now he's really working with these energies. The physical body continues. He starts to be move from a little kid more to having his own character being a fuller character. So, it's not just he's stronger physically and that's all he can do. Other things started to come into play. His uh leadership capabilities, his uh um interest in justice for the fishermen of the village. Uh when the tax guys came and were overdoing it, he got pissed off. He said that tapped this more and he got pissy because of the injustice of it all. Uh so that was a major for him that, allowing that more and more and more and more till he developed into preo sensei a hell of a great warrior. Okay. But he was missing a little something. He said that uh come and go uh not come and go hit and miss. It's kind of a hit and miss. he'd have it and then maybe the next day he didn't have it kind of thing. So he says his energies pushed him to meet Tada and Ta is doing this more full boore and Noente picked up this more fullness of that more centered character energy development. Okay., Uh so he was able to get the fullest of that., Okay., But he didn't want to be a super talada. Okay., See the energies then pushed him to Deuchi., Now he gets to Duchi. He's got this hell of a character with a hell of a lot of fire in the belly, a hell of a lot of boom energy there. The Gucci says, "Oh, okay, cool. Wow." But you're missing the great circle of things and the great self a sense. I said he had a sense of these. It's not an unknown thing, but he wasn't really tapping or utilizing. Okay. for example to come back again. uh as you develop your character then things around you might happen better you know you get elected mayor or whatever things around you start to affect it he was aware of that but it wasn't a major sense the Gucci said it's major okay so then he adds into his [Applause], positioning of things the great circle and the great self Okay. And that led him to being Oh, sensei. Ah, did I lay that out pretty good? Did I mention anything you hadn't heard before? Sensei, could you? You used a phrase that his father took him down to the beach?, H, what was the implication of going down to the beach? Sumo, get physical. No more of this. You're overdoing it. Well, they had a sense of them. No, you ain't going to be no Buddhist priest. Get your ass down here. It was a good combination. his parents, his father, I, would say, as you might say, would was intuitive about him that martial arts was going to be very important for him because along the way, he also helped support him and set up a dojo in the backyard, whatever he did. He, felt he had a sense that, was important and, made that easier, better, facilitated that invited a famous judo guy to come down and teach him stuff like, that. So his father had a good intuitive sense later in his life when he was in the army and said, "Hey, I kind of like being in the army, you know, uh training and all this stuff." And he mentioned to his father he'd like to make uh be full-time army uh make army his career. His father said no way no. So his father had an in intuitive sense of him and, and stuff. So anyway, just giving you an example now, special case, but to see how fast this, inner energy manifesting through how fast it can work. And in one sense, uh it's even faster than that, but that gets really magical, but feasible. Uh but just it's there. And it works. Okay. Uh and again we should play with it, tap it, gymnasium, exercise with it. Okay. A little bit like we were doing and do it more and for a longer period of time if this catches you. Now the aliveness factor. So, we don't want to call it a fifth piece. We got our four majors. Uh, but it's, I don't know. Don't want to go too far here. It underlies everything. Okay. There's an eventual. It underlies everything. Oh. Uh, I forget how I used to use paper and then the drawings on the paper. uh but in this case I could say the uh aliveness uh alt key whatever you want to call it uh is the paper and anything drawn on the paper is going to be affected by the aliveness of the paper and have its own aliveness. So if you draw something click it has its own aliveness and you draw something else over here on the paper it has its own aliveness., Okay. kind of singing a lot here. [Music] Anyway,, where are we? Say something. Questions. Are you lost? Aliveness., Aliveness., Sensei. It's Justin. The uh I would like to say how as, you've mentioned uh quite a few times tonight and in other classes that the emphasis here is on the actual experiential component of the inviting and allowing um an experience with the aliveness and soaking in that and seeing how these other four pieces are inter distinct but interrelated to each other. And maybe um you know this aliveness invites whatever relevant piece may need highlighting at a moment or so but experientially not just in the knowing of what's, happening., Yeah., Yeah. You can have a beautiful idea about how the universe works and stuff but not, be an o sensei a Christ an advanced being beyond wow. uh you ain't going to get there. Sorry. You need a certain amount of knowledge. Yes. And then the experience of it. I like to, some degree work them in tandem. Okay. Uh find your own words and but and I can't force this. Those people are just going to mental image it only are going to continue probably to mental image it only. I've said this over and over for years. I'm getting a little tired of saying it. So whatever, you've also pointed out how it's a percentage game. It doesn't all go from, you know, tight to awesome. There's a there's some incremental. That's why I pump. Pumping. Yes. The first pump. I don't know if I feel anything on the first one. No, I'm pretty good. I might feel a little something, but it's all intents and purpose. I ain't feeling much. Pump it again. Oh, start to feel a little, something happening. Uh, he was saying his joints and stuff were getting looser. Oh, my, my back is straightening. Oh, I have more back. Oh, pump it again. And pump it again. Gee, I'm starting to feel a little bouncy here. A little springy. Hey., Yeah. Uh, just Yes., uh increments after a bit. It's not meant to keep you in incremental little bit to a little bit to a little, bit to a little bit to a little bit forever. It's not meant to do that. I call that again the checker board example, a square at a time and you reach a little point suddenly they king you and you go across the whole board. But don't ignore or treat uh treat diminish uh put down the square at a time. It's okay, Bobby. Robert Nad, it's okay. It's okay, Sensei. It's okay eventually. And enough. I've got a pretty good sense of things now. More straight away, more direct., And right there as I started to do that the force got clearer. Okay. And, different ones may show to different people. The self started to want to hey I'm here. Okay. And start to show itself much clearer than what I picked up. Uh the space showed itself much clearer and sort of I don't know how it works space. Uh definitely the design, of creation is continuing to clarify and show itself better. But that happened at a certain level where I Oh, there's 1 2 3 4. Oh yeah. So when I've had enough of Bobby Robert just to check to make sure I'm on the right track. Okay., Bobby Robert Nado. I got it. No, I I'm not I ain't got it. I'm, I'm not here. There we go. I'm here. There's a certain experience of hearing this here. Now, because I'm here, the potential for going inner faster, quicker, fuller is present. Uh Oliver, how you doing with all this stuff here in, on your live stream? Let me give a quick background. Oliver's a collegiate type uh, teaches at universities and stuff. Uh iikidoist and a yoga., Yeah. Loves meditation. Yeah, thanks. Um, great. Yeah, it's very different being, live. I've only been live once when you first started these calls in the when I was in the UK. We've talked about it on the phone. It's a different feeling when you're live in the group's life. So, um, I've been playing around with this last a couple of weeks ago. But um character has been a big thing for me the last couple of years probably and dealing with that sort of dullness, emptiness and energizing vitality. Did, you say in majoring funny around with character that became aware of the dormcancy or hollowess let's say? Yeah. So this is a tendency I had. So, I've been playing around with feeling, sensing the aliveness of the character, whichever character is showing or whoever I am at that moment. And I was playing around with that the couple of weeks ago. Um, and it keeps coming back and, allowing the character to feel the energy of the character. Something like, affected by it. affected by and it's like um sets up a internal charging dynam like a what do they call it like on a bicycle which charges itself or something like this dynamo. Yeah motion. Yeah. And the character energizes itself by feeling by feeling its own energy. It's, a fascinating. Yeah. Really fascinating. Yeah., Up again today. Yeah. Cool. Um, yeah. And as you get an example of the aliveness factor in the character and how that benefits the character, whatever, then when you're working a different aspect and you're reminded it's alive, uh, more apt to, well, it was funner than hell with the character and his aliveness. Therefore, whatever aspect is showing the circle, the, the design, whatever is showing that the aliveness of that one that happens to be presenting or highlighting itself that day. So, you've got already more of a familiarity with the aliveness thing. Yeah., Yeah., Yeah. To be closer to home. Um, and the aliveness of character, uh, when I feel that aliveness as, who I am, um, the as we've talked about the it's easy to mix up space and world. Um, but they become really distinct if the characters fully alive, more fully alive. Let's say not fully alive, but more fully alive. Those become more distinct. And, um, I picked up ah, this is what I was going to say. to that dullness or emptiness which can sometimes we can mistake a space but re really fully realizing that space has its own energy completely undercuts that it's not possible to see it all as empty anymore or anything like that. It's not space has energy. It's a misunderstanding. So that, got cleared up for me last couple of weeks and then again came up in this session. Okay., Yeah., You're in the right place doing the right thing. It sounds like all a lot of energy. Yeah, a lot of energy. Yeah, a lot of energy in space. Put it that way. Yeah. And yeah, world shines. It's really nice to be to be in the world. The world's shining., Did you hear that, Autumn? I wasn't just talking to you. You were an example of it. I was setting up for Oliver and whoever. Uh aliveness., Aliveness., Aliveness., Yeah. And, to do things at a better level. Let, me go back to Let me see. I'll see if I hope I can say the words right. Okay, let's say you've been jogging and you're getting winded and often what we do when we're winded is stop and get more air or oxygen. Okay, and fine. Yes, air, oxygen, whatever does all of that. But while we're doing that, why not do a finer level? energy, the breathing is still going on and probably being improved, but I'm just in a inner finer of the energy beats which affect the breathing. But if I just stay with breathing, I'm just going to stay at breathing. And that's all I'm going to be able to talk about. How the oxygen moves to hair and your blood cells do this. It's like, yeah,, yeah, yeah. But are you going to stay at that physical level forever? So, as soon as possible and take something basic and then trade it into a finer. Okay. And the same basic is going on if the basic is move your hand this way. Okay. Yeah, I can do that here. Watch me do that. Okay. But they're saying and then uh this muscle connects with that muscle and that helps turn it this way and you stay there forever. Wait that stuff. Well, if I'm going to do that inner finer, inner finer and move all different sensations going on. Inner finer. Do that. Okay. So any simple things my saying is good any simple things fine but as soon as possible inner finer and let the simple things inner finer and inner finer and inner finer and then the simple thing as a as a outer reference for inner finer work. Did that come across to you? Yeah. So again, you're winded. Yes, you got to breathe a bit more. But while you're breathing a bit more, why not do finer level and do what the energy created it finer energy? You're not going to stop breathing. You're not going to die there. The breathing is still going on as a what you say after effect. But you also get practice with inner finer. While other people are getting your breath back, you're getting re-energized from the inner out. Should make you a superior runner after a bit. I hope that came across. Did that dumb example come across people? So anyway, kind of a basic take a dumb thing and practice with it. You know, I don't have to practice to go up this little flight of stairs. Okay. But I do on a good day. Easy. Open. A little change to become a stair walker. Because here too far I was just a, coffee getter into the kitchen and back. Oh stairs just a quick moment changing it mixes up. Stair climber in my youth I could hop up very pretty. I struggle a bit now but screw it. Anyway, h I'm finishing up here. People, what do you got? You got anything for me? questions, problems, insights. Maybe just appreciation. Thank you. That's okay, too. Quiet tonight. Say something. Autumn, you're back home. Hi, Sensei.

foreign hey I'm on okay good evening everybody ah okay uh, we're gonna continue on from last week uh use some different words hope gets across, uh but so we have an energy source starting with the physical and naturalist start hair being in the Physical Realm in the physical body uh that we're using the word core and core is that first earlier uh sense of energy radiating okay slowly again the Pilates people the yoga people the bodybuilders they're all catching onto core and they get a bit of a physical plexus core which Reps for an energy location and they're getting a lot of benefit out of that okay ah, to continue past that level uh, we could use some of the Chinese terminology but uh Tai Chi with their Center core energy radiating at a certain level they get Freer better moving hands as they continue to settle open my words settle open and get into the next level of it or dimension of it uh with that energy radiating your uh their arms and stuff are still active and good and then the legs come in and they're starting to be free and active and good they continue on with a better core more energy radiating and the more Fuller of the body is involved okay and it goes on and on and on, all right the tendency with the humans uh will be when they start to get past the what do we call it outline of the physical body and it starts to get finer and finer and they don't have a sense of the outline of the body okay but there's still a body there at first we could call the first level in energy body okay as we continue finer and finer uh different words come up uh help me I forget the words Bob click chakra body chakra body and it's okay yeah I don't like that one for now causal body that would be a big one you're looking at Astros Auto Body astral body no see Astro body for me is when you're dead and you still continue there's still a body but when you're dead it's an astral body so I don't know if I can use an astro body here because I'm not dead okay, Aura anyway what whatever there are different words different uh yoga groups Chinese groups whoever have different words for the continuation of body okay body okay all of those levels I think we're trying to depict it here uh so let's say this is a body and maybe the body energy level move on and then we get a finer level move on dimensionally and we get a finer level and that they their name different okay but there's still a body there's still, here, here oh, a causal body let me drift up and Float around uh mentally doing something with the causal body it's here, here, here, here or as a sensor and say don't go anywhere it's all here but it's an inner finer level and it goes the distance okay uh we're getting close to it when a different diagram I use sometime back thinking fine we think get the layout and we begin to feel our practice and first the first feeling is kind of heavy uh if I'm playing with energy and I'm heavy I don't really feel the energy not, very well easy settle open finer feeling now I begin to feel a little bit uh more warmth a kind of a little flow there, uh easy settle open moving into a better dimension, finer feeling okay so thinking feeling finer feeling and, sense feeling now we're getting much finer sense feeling experiential sensing, but there's an experience in that sentencing is that so that pattern Oak okay kind of old stuff just reminding you and kind of reviewing are we okay so far that was a question yes, Okay so a character goes dimensionally uh we've tried to uh Brad we've tried to show this just a reminder for those that are IP don't types okay easy and special person physical the physical, easy settle open and I might move around a little faster and there is a body physical body that has some bit of energy flowing around and they had done a bit of energy it's a bit of energy okay easy so open Fuller and I'll say I don't think about that level at the moment but and soon there'll be an energy body here easy energy body exactly okay yeah so just a quick reminder of our earlier Aikido sort of a kindergarten introduction to this world which we've used that uh we could have used uh I do this technique and easy sale because there's a little more energy there's more energy okay, anyway simple reminder basics so if you're going to Major remember we have four big pieces uh of creation, the space of it character is ongoing he doesn't stop uh at the edge of the body finer and finer and the different words that different groups would use for that cause of a body whoa Priscilla of body character okay who has access to more energy okay if I'm in a smaller level and I don't have the energy it's even hard to think about doing something if it really get squashed in can't do it no way easy Center open oh you can begin to put a cap on it I sort of I sense touch it inner sense touch it and it begins to show it's there and I touch it again ah and it's there and then I begin to do techniques okay or what whatever uh so, dimensional energy the energies are there it's a matter of us, opening to them knowing which piece we're using, the body to get to more energy using the body and then the inner sensing whatever the finer bodies are of tapping more energy okay, the self we've played a little bit with self now self is a different piece and self has its energy okay, find your level of self has more energy space itself is not empty and the certain way it has energy okay and the designer construct of creation, is also energy okay now the, differences I, use the word flavor they may flavor a bit different the energy of the self may have a little different flavor than the energies uh that a character would be picking up on okay and on and on all right so they all have access to energy let me say this dumb example bear, with me with me on the table uh go bread though okay and it's all laid out flat right, now you take a cookie cutter like a star-shaped boom that cookie cutter has access to that dough which is all energy but it has a different little shaping or something, so it looks different it's Christmas time so you have another cookie cutter that looks like Santa Claus okay Claus okay uh do you like animals and uh, uh Amy would have a bird she said the birds okay, uh anyway so these different designs of creation, the construct design the self the character would I miss self-care oh the space of it they all are in this creation of energy so it doesn't matter which approach you take, all of them have energy and as you settle and open on that line you're on there's more available and more available, I said a lot did I say it right that I confuse you all I'm so sense of this is Lauren and I, hear you saying you know the major four but you're saying tonight that it since they're all energy or energetic um, could all run on the same energy wait let me let me jump and see if this takes care of it okay and now the creation starts so they're all related or have access to or made up of this energy does that help any or is this issue yes and so they're all made of the same fundamental energy even though they might have qualities and they are yeah the original yeah the original as it comes down tighter then it will break up this great mass of water let's call it now, will break up into big rivers and then break up into tributaries and break up break up into tributaries and break up into creeks and, so and they're all energy but they're listening less and less, I also hear you saying that some people might be drawn to develop their character and some people might really you know uh resonate with space and it so they should follow that yeah because it all leads to the same place in a way eventually yeah uh Steve L.A I was talking to you on the phone and you were majoring a couple of weeks ago in space okay right that's what you said to me yes, okay and then suddenly the other day, you're doing space based in suddenly character was there wanting character wanting to work character is that what you told me yes, okay I had no intention of, that it just seemed to, want to go there he character took Central stage could we say yes okay uh so your ability when you're doing any of this work is knowing when there's something changing and not letting that throw you or confuse you or what's our smear word smudge I'm getting smudged by that, okay that there's space Oh it's changing what's going on oh character seems to want to have full stage the full platform here so that's a possible possibility that uh okay, uh things will change along the way did I say that right yeah like for instance today, um, I thought I thought character was now going to get Center Stage again and self decided that it was wanting a tune yeah so yeah it's just it's just being receptive to what is, wanting to show yeah as you play with these things and get a little clearer uh you get receptive to I'm trying to do this piece uh, what you're doing self and you're struggling because it's not its turn one of the other pieces is preempting and saying no it's my turn so to recognize that and be okay with that yeah that drove me crazy for a couple of times because I would have my idea what I want to work on in that morning's practice and, damn I work and work and it wasn't working and I realized, eventually it took me like 45 minutes a couple of times I learned a lot uh that it wasn't to turn for that one and me forcing it wasn't making it any easier so I started starting now with more hello I'm going to settle an open okay more space but what wants to show and it could be the space wants to show more about the space or the character wants to come in or the self wants to come in or the design creation thing wants to come in uh so a little more open now that I might have been in previous years okay and I recognize the pieces so it's easier not to get confused as you as you hang out with anyone whatever take turns you, get a sense of them you don't confuse your wife with the male my mail lady my male person is a lady I don't confuse my male lady person with my wife they have a different sense what I call it what word that I use not textured flavor their flavor is different, okay you begin to recognize oh that's a male lady oh that's my wife dumb huh are you getting any of this uh anyway uh so I'm just saying also things will get clearer as you play and hang out especially with the sense of experiencing that not just being aware but the sense of experiencing they're all feeling themselves feeling their own energy for lack of a word we call it experience okay thinking won't quite do it heavy feeling not really finer feeling a touch finer heading towards sensing sense feeling I'm beginning to really start to have that experience and continue to even finer with sensing okay, we use an up down thing like awareness of thinking is up here and this energy experiential is more down here is how we present it yeah I'm sorry I kind of cut it in half that way there's a tendency in The Human Condition to have majored in the awareness knowing about thinking about no problem but it has a partner if you would which is the more under experiential okay and watch out the awareness part will I don't know to say get close or having enough awareness calls up a little energy and you'll pick that up and you think I'm experiencing not to the depth and the fullness of a full experience all right all right Oliver you're giving me that look say something semi-intelligent that's your damn your plugs in come on you can do it he seems to be having internet problems Sensei it seems like he's in Thailand right now so I am Can You Hear Me Yes actually we're getting video problems please turn off your video yeah great it's the Wi-Fi here and I'm outside it's a little noisy this morning for some reason Saturday morning everyone goes crazy um yeah I'm in Thailand and I mean during the um pandemic I, hadn't trained very much um if at all until December so in terms of Aikido practice and I've been a bit out the loop but then I, train here when I'm here so I went, to my first class in uh at the University here on Wednesday evening, and I and I just in, terms of when things show themselves I, just found I've had it quite a few times this week in a few different ways and things reminding me of pieces so when I was for example when I was training on the Wednesday night quite a lot of the Thai women here there's quite a few really good students but they're very um short and quite sturdy and strong but a really low physical Center and um but there's more there and, I was training with two different students and, I just felt this they got a lot of ground you know and the teacher was doing all kinds of different variations and techniques it was way, too much it was spinning out everywhere but they kept this ground it didn't matter what was going on they had this ground and so the next morning I was in my I went for a sauna, steam uh and I was sort of sat in there and I had this um real call for down time it was really I haven't had one for a little while but it was really a strong downtime feeling and it was exactly that down in the ground the ground opening and feeling and uh and then, becoming an energy source the ground becoming a real energy source and feeling the juice throat flow up through my feet as I was sat relaxing um and it was it's just something about that like the world can remind you of something, and then it comes and it shows in your process or calls you to the process a good thing when you said during, that week more than a few things happened that were really the same thing right exactly so or red or whatever when you get by three or more things a week I tend to pay attention Okay exactly, personally I don't listen and, even the world will boom somebody will say something and then a couple days later a different person will say virtually the same thing yeah another person spoon oh my God uh yeah they're touching you internally uh or something you keep sensing or something that comes at you the other person talking to you uh pay heed is what I would say to every everybody okay is not a coincidence oh what a coincidence yeah but it's based on something hopefully yeah in your case yeah definitely and it's a feeling and but it just makes total sense I mean I've just moved country in a seven hour time difference and I need to settle down here in a new home and I knew everything it just makes sense that I, need to settle and find a new ground like and, I felt that sense of opening coming from it so the ground was there and then I could open more um and it's a different level I'm able to feel more grounded and open here for some reason I don't know why I just feel very at home here it's really an interesting mix where these things are all coming in to give me a more ground more sense of being here more feeling and some cultures uh, so you're noticing the people there seem to be more important yeah more sensitive more open and Lauren especially the farmer types in Japan even in uh well you were there yes, but they were still heavily grounded, very much so Tokyo bringing their fruit and vegetables in on their back or something those old ladies remember those old ladies yep but they were had some ground and support and they'd carry some damn heavy stuff uh they're more grounded and I don't know uh yeah and anyway I think some culture is just naturally more grounded I, think for example our culture a lot of thinking and mind going on and, that screen you guys look at day after day uh I think you've lost a little bit of that potentially you know unless you're actually training and settling and feeling and whatever uh the little tendency here to be drawn out into that stuff and forget this stuff some cultures are still closer to it even though they're being drug out too of course but they're essentially yes, yeah well we can actually see you quite clearly now Oliver so where are you exactly I'm in The Chiang Mai in North Thailand and so I used to live out here about 15 years ago and so I, came back I studied massage here for several months and then my teacher he's getting on so I wanted to come and come see him so I'm also receiving quite a few Thai massage treatments which is all on the ground and very kind of earthy and slow and a lot of feeling contact but very subtle as well so and so this it's yeah it's all kind of drawing me back down really it's really nice, feeling at the moment, thank you very much appreciate it his experience was kind of basic a feeling of being drawn down definitely downtime uh moving into a deeper also always add as you go deeper finer Dimension and he felt that draw down it said something about its energy I forget how he worded it but it's energy and he felt that energy uh moving something vibratory through the body yeah, perfect, example very simple oh yeah wow that's, sort of how it works, settle down open be open settle down a bit deeper inferring finer Dimension and because there's more energy because there's more energy because the energy said to show through the body we could say oh right at that moment he was on a character uh body who uh took the main stage and feeling the energy yeah, okay ah okay ah okay where was I going before and anybody anything uh so far so good any, anything in the case would get lost anything along the way I wonder Sensei if you can bring us to fire in the belly that's the energy it's just a term it's like core fire in the belly it refers to the energies that's available on any it's not lineage but any form that you approach on character form space form self Style self Style that as you settle and open each one of those, has access to more energy that is there it's there oh okay, so here try to say okay this is the dimensional uh of Body Energy body finer causal body whatever names they, use and they all have an energy that's pres not an idea of it it's an actual energy presence energy presence okay then if we shift to uh the self the self okay easy the eye more room there's a self here itself and when you hit clear we spent some time on self but again when you get clear on uh that self is experiencing itself again can't do it with the idea you can set it up with the idea cool feeling feeling's a little heavy to pick up self find your feeling still a little heavy it might when we start heading into sensing territory then self should make itself known okay and I'm just reminding you that itself has its own energy did I say that okay so we started with the word fire in the belly we could have started with the word core we could have started with he's got guts why do some people have guts and others don't we could have started with any of those heavy ass words because they're all symbolically talking about this okay, okay is that all right yes, yeah and [Music], I myself and I, I, I think for everyone unless you're uh a student of or a major in or are you gonna stop at that level and teach that level or just work that level uh that you'd hang out at a certain level for certain period of time I don't not talking years here in some cases could be some minutes or moments and that you move on to the next finder so my thing is to go finer and finer and finer heading towards more original who am I really, and before all of that who am I I'm trying to head back into the original okay, uh so again nothing wrong for some people to stop at it or okay core starting to court now somebody may want to major in why core helps people be better athletes and they could major because that's their job or their level that's okay but I don't think for you and me unless core is your major you're supposed to teach it or whatever, let's move on let's move on who am I really uh I'm not adequate well wait a minute is there anything I can do with this process that we're playing with, to be more adequate in whatever music uh family relations fighting I don't give a whatever, okay whatever okay anybody something need a moment's break say something intelligent ask a dumb question I don't care do something thank you and again zilch nada Sensei this is Liam, I'm usually uh kind of hanging in the background but um just from what you're saying, uh getting to that question of what, what is what is this really what is self really um I get an impression of the, the more I tune into the energies of the character and feeling how the makeup of the characters working it has its own intelligence and creative Energies, yes and it's a different the this and that the limiting factor feels like when I get mixed up with the flavor of self to the flavor of energies to character yeah, that's yeah you're not the only one uh there's, such buddies could we say in fact that's what I've done here see this is character this itself and I'm going to say by the way soon that let's look at them overlay they're not separate like that they're, not separate like that they're overlaid and because of such close buddies okay it's easy especially at first to be confused between self and character okay as you fun around more and experience and say the character more uh then shift with a sense that okay character is off the stage of space let's say and here comes self and hopefully them self comes out and you settle and it experience with self is experiencing and it gets more and more distinct because they the flavor is a bit different yeah, so yeah so that comment is like not unexpected because of that closeness they have they have everything's overlaid but they're really buddies, yeah, yeah and that uh, the, supportness of how the space there and, what you're saying I think is real uh um key to knowing that the self has different FL it's a different flavor and if you get that mixed up you get something kind of gross and uh feeling kind of mixed up because it's like the flavors are blending in a way that they're not meant to yeah uh we call it that's not smearing smudging yeah, and I can see where a lot of people would get confused if they got a couple of things going on and they're smudging them uh so that's why we tried to clarify that and brought up the word smudge and, what we're trying to do now that uh maybe Steve La Steve what if we're talking about this confusion between character and self I think you played in that region how do you how do you determine uh, how do you tell experience the difference between the developing character run and if it were to change or you were to change it to now time for yourself how, do you distinguish them uh it was it was real it was real easy today, um I'm trying to think of what it was that made it so obvious that's what we're asking yes, um uh you know character is, you know in a way maybe part of it has to do with the fact they have much more experience with character than with self but it's also character seems to have more of a, specific definition in the sense that uh, you know different characters are going to have different roles different garments that they're wearing yeah, yeah, yeah, I am a wood cutter let me take a shower and I'm a go to partyer I'm a dancer now let me do that yeah that continue yeah and self I mean it's, not that it isn't a thing but it doesn't have that same kind of uh definitions I've got to go cut wood personally per se yeah sorry people yeah I mean anyway uh, as you around people as you fun around uh with these whenever they show how and hang out especially with the more experiential part and the phrasing I use I don't know if it's great but feeling what they feel experiencing what it is feeling is kind of my words I don't know if they're great words for you uh but then they get very distinct so it's, easier to, spot a change or who wants Central stage that day that period of time you're in you're playing with this so uh hang out and practice you know see sometimes you want answers people in general not necessarily talking to you guys but people in general they thought well tell me tell me how it works tell me how I should know which is different it's like screw you, sit you settle you feel you experience no, tell me screw you again I ain't gonna do that not really anyway so, if as this guy curtain character settles and opens naturally moves into finer Dimensions binder Dimensions have more energy so even that hurts a couple of simple stages and I demonstrated the grammar school level whatever with the Aikido energy flows uh not that far away easy settle not quite there yet easy settle oh we're starting to float a little bit it was less effort to lift them and, there there's a little bit of lift up whoa okay I also noticed they seem to work well together they seem to be uh I don't know would have a nice dancers flavor and on stage flavor whatever that is easy settle open Next Level has more energy the energy through the system energy that's present oh, now it felt like the upflow came from the floor level maybe below the floor the floor level maybe below the floor but right now floor level and it moved from floor level and is moving it up the first one where it felt like was being moved up uh just start like around here that one felt like that level comes from deeper and it moved up no big deal but it tells me I'm moving along and also Clues me in that oh it's deeper, the energy source is deeper oh okay and on and on and on I don't I forget where I was going with that okay uh, so again we play with self a bit easier the eye easy the eye itself, as you get past thinking and heavy feeling fine and so I could get into sensing self should make itself known again, okay self for lack of words trading itself in for the next level so deeper in more space so, okay I'm hearing uh and not in my ear just someplace hearing uh I've been around I'm not a newbie here okay so it's the beginning of saying how ancient or how early in the game of creation it was perfect Bobby as Bobby is fairly new here or whatever he's got 80 years in and fading fast, okay uh but the self seems to be inferring I'm a I'm a long-termer Bobby's coming going here I am as a ventric dinner since I've historically got, ah, when, I first bumped into self in that sense uh one way it delineated itself explained itself was that sense of Bobby's come and go I exist okay I'm, before Bobby and I'll be here after Bobby okay when I really got a good sense of that a self and was feeling what it was feeling or having an experience as self uh a lot of my attitude change about getting killed or something it's like I remember an almost bad car accident almost and I thought it was quite humorous because I was so I had such a strong feeling at that particular time of self was there Bobby's come and go if he gets wiped out I'm still me self uh so I found that whole potential accident and it was a bad potential uh to be quite humorous if I didn't have self-identic you know I got Bobby's gonna go and there's only Bobby there's nobody else but Bobby, there's nobody else but Bobby but having self there and having an experience lack of words now experience, lack of words now experience with Shelf has self whatever however to say that it was a whole different flavor okay, not that if you tell me I'm going to die tomorrow Bobby won't go and quiver a bit yeah that's human, reaction but, it doesn't take away from the fact that after Bobby there'll be a self that's okay and okay and the Bobby character will then move into uh his more appropriate level now we're going to get astral being there or whatever uh but I'm still uh following the nado de Bobby Nado or line I'm getting up on other stuff right now so anyway uh now in terms of energy why I did this, way I wish I could have done them overlaid but I don't have the ability of doing that uh the equipment to do that right uh the character finder and finer Dimension has energy okay we demonstrated the first kindergarten level of energy flows through that level easy then there's an energy body a great time G master all energies, whatever and we continue trade that in and finer and finer and finer and finer being open to in prison with the more energy that's available that's just there in his system could I say system okay now I'd like to Overlay that with the self, I don't say this right the self in more room is started that way or even let's start easy the eye easy TI the eye is neither self nor character it's some not the right word aberration when things got tight the self and the character suddenly and I came up out of that I, I, it's not it's not could I say an original creation easy the eye and the self will show it's there the character and his her development through dimensions will show it's there uh so the eye can screw this up a bit so easy the eye in retrospect it's a beautiful statement I'm so happy I presented that early in the game easy, the eye okay, easy now we know more about space easy the eye in more space okay, there is an alive because there's all this energy at the level of characters that character has a lot of energy outflow radiation choose your own words and now I'm adding and also there is a self underlying that could I say there's a self right here right here underline that and self has its own juiciness, radiation, glow find your own words okay and when self is better aligned with the character I wonder if that almost doesn't I'm going to double up but the energy of self, and right in alignment with it the energies of character so in self's energies lines up to characters energy that there's even a extra kick there okay, if it's some kind of double mint gum thing double your pleasure double your oomph, so I'm working on that this week uh I'll have a better sense of it next week but uh but that overlay and so in more space easy the eye in more space character with its radiating energy, and, easy shifting in that space same size space we infer he's in, that space self and self has its own glow it's inner that radiates okay, and to position those two better with each other are you following me so far I, didn't lose you on that, I I'm going to add to it in a minute but I want to make sure we're okay sort of since I, think it was really clear and I just want to say that it's my experience professionally that when people find the right job for them all right what are they going to do in their work it's when you when you find a job that suits you yes I was going to say that suits you yes right then you thrive, yeah and when you take a job that doesn't suit you yeah it's horrible I've done both and you know so direct experience it, it when they align it's a really enormous energy work no longer seems like work you want to do it yeah and that's wonderful thing yeah where this came up strongly uh Susan are you on tonight she is okay be prepared to jump in here uh some of the work I do with Susan in the, healing field in uh getting to the finer of beings people and their selves to see why they're, hurt or why they can't get better or what the hell is ailing in Susan gets a lot of cases uh, of where the doctor can't quite make out what's going on because she got a good read through dimensionally gets a good read one thing we notice in, I don't know how to use the words we haven't developed a proper language in this field here uh and looking through them or passing through them, uh through the physical body to finer energy body of them uh and then we start to catch courts the importance of self present and what we saw was a lot of cells not being in alignment with the body they were we have a lot of hovers okay, we have a lot of shelves that are so uh about the human world that they're really further back and hiding out would come in, a cave off to the side uh and they're not helping because they're so they stretch this line this like, a umbilical cord type thing they stretch up stretch it out so far uh that the person character is not being aided by the energy the self if it would position better that if the self with its juiciness would position better with the character its radiation would make remind a support the energy of the character so we get a double flow there I hope I said that right Danny I was trying to impress you with that when you were doing your cancer stuff Danny you on, yes I am yes I am and obviously thinking about that as you're speaking Yeah and yeah then we have a hell of a lot of resources with this inner energy not just this body character but use that one because he goes finer and finer and finer and more and more and more but also getting the self there so the self facilitate supports adds to this okay kind of thing so that that's what I was trying to say I hope I said it a little better clearer tonight but that's what I've been trying to say in some of our dialogues yeah yes, and I, I um I think it well I'm sure that what I managed to access and from your prompting was the self that could direct my healing as opposed a doctor or someone prescribing something and that was a daily a daily it almost became like a prayer and an interaction with this thing this that lay within me and this that was that was a huge possibility and I wasn't given a lot of possibility believe me if I'm gonna die we might cut your leg off here all that good right they gave me a chance it was to change deep within me so that I could recognize so that the, cancer could be recognized and, put to death basically and I it seems that that's what's happened I'm eternally grateful for, that coaching believe me yeah and there's so much possibilities I mean just this is this creation we're in as we learn how it works and how to work with it in it and develop in it oh my God the possibilities it's not just martial arts Allah oh sensors it's healing people trying to think it's, endless possibilities uh and Mankind as a group or not anywhere near there but there it is it we'll see we'll see in the future what's the future I don't know another couple hundred years a thousand I don't know we'll see but let's do what we can do today, okay anyway uh Susan thank you anything to add to what me and Danny were mulling about there mucking about it what I'm gonna say that, uh before what Lauren said about you know when you're in the right job and that's where character itself are aligned or overlaid properly right there could we say that no likes that you're doing that job because self has an idea of Google yeah a sense of what you should be doing in this life and when you hit the right job for that, time that the self is happy yeah because, its character is going right according to the plan of self, the words the words yeah, yes yeah yes yeah and if it's right you often feels Lauren was saying some kind of Bleak I'm home in this job or whoa did I look into this beautiful I looked into this kind of thing yeah so I I've jumped back in since, I yeah started this, thread, I know somebody who's uh naturally curious, always asking people very good people skills, can't help themselves and they became a journalist where their natural tendencies were exact fit for what that sort of profession required and then that same person tried to become a commercial real estate broker where she had to keep everything close to her to their vest and it was so difficult it just didn't flow from them and so it's really I'm sure that you know Bob Noah and many others have this same experience where sometimes who you are is just the character that's needed in that job you know an a natural salesperson over you know somebody that is really good at problem solving whatever it is ideally hopefully they luck out and find their fit and uh they don't have to do anything when that happens it's yeah I have a quick story thank you thank you back many years uh in my psychic time this lady I knew we were belong to the same Dog Club uh and she knew I was I was a sensitive and, and she said yeah my son is having problems uh getting the right job I said oh let me check and I got on a check and I came back directed sales she says oh it can't be sales he said I don't know 23 selling jobs I was an enormous amount of jobs and three it was like 23 or something and they don't work out, I said whoa what they didn't even try 23 selling jobs so I went back home again what's going on here and my feeling was it's not the sales it was probably the product he hadn't found the product that he could sell and feel comfortable selling with probably his, problem and I probably said that too I don't remember now it's been a long time ago uh but, yeah so sometimes people find a cause or a product or whatever but when you find it and if you get little tricks of the trade people and if you get bored with that job okay uh let's see you're thinking about quitting okay we don't know if you ought to quit the job the job okay I think you don't know and I don't know okay know okay what I'd like to have people do there is in the job they're in move that situation trade it in for a finer dimension of that situation which includes them in the situation and in that finer Dimension flavor it out, if, if, if they can if they have a sense of being able to do it easier doing it better seeing things clearer than they've seen before okay and if not then we could say oh it's not your job look for something different, did I say that oh okay go cute yeah for sure and, sometimes a job is just right for you at one place in your life and then you move on yeah you literally trade it in for the next thing or one of my buddies on the police force uh, they're left the department he was on fairly Young uh so I don't know sorry but let's say he wasn't happy there but he moved to the country and got on the country sheriff's department or something and he was very happy so uh yeah whatever yes you got the flavor people yeah okay so what do you think about the possibility of the energies present with self and the finer level of self what we're doing is manifesting glowing radiating whatever and because you've also practiced a bit of making sure the self is lined up with the character okay not just an idea about that but an actual, to yourself sheer body sheer body here this amount of space it's all going on here it's inner finer but a chair yeah and you got any sense of that potential, double Bang I'll research ignore next week but which what's your sense Sensei this is Justin I'd like to say um I would hang out hang on yeah sure you do this do you have this effect on everyone Justin okay this is how you deal with it Mercury was in retrograde and you know I'm going to defer to Mercury okay my heater came on it makes a lot of noise over here turned it off so, um I I'd like to say that uh as the as self is overlaid and aligned better with the character there is a fuller sense of presence radiating through the character and um, is the ability to stay open to how South might guide the obviousness of what's coming up along the course of your journey as a character in the world or being in the world, next steps next steps along the course of your mission might be more of obvious because self can guide or motivate you through your character so to speak has that capability yeah um it's not that self or some kind of for everybody some kind of great fantastic god-like uh there's some selves that are I don't know they call them newbies uh they don't have a lot of experience they haven't been around long or something uh and they can develop because originally there was an original stuff so they can develop back to that but at the level they're at I don't know anything, uh so uh, so uh but as we but as we let ourselves develop it should uh get pretty fancy or you want to be on this program watching this nonsense for a couple of years Jesus anyway uh again are we okay with that sense of alignment I think we talked about it six months ago or something and I asked and you're some of you are playing with it and notice yourself was off to the side I think Danny said that Danny off to the side self uh somebody else noticed a hovering I brought up a couple of cases way back when I had a real sick kid and uh I tried to call himself in to help the kid you know to back them up so to speak and uh the self said no way it was way up in some like astral planes it already like wherever it was it was very high and he essentially said hell no I ain't coming in I think I was trying to get him to take ownership of a totally wrecked car I think you're probably no hope for this kid, and he wasn't going to using my phrasing he wasn't going to retake ownership of this totally wrecked car and I didn't quite understand how things worked so we had a bit of an argument you should this poor kid's gonna die basically said I don't give a screw you too you too okay so we have all these variations of self so as you work and allow the self to develop It Can Go the Distance remember everything Can Go the Distance okay and uh the presence of self as it I don't say develops uh becomes more aware and experiential with itself as self a pretty fancy unit pretty fancy unit okay uh, don't diverge too much somebody where, are we uh Sensei Bond here yeah a, a really nice example of, the capability you were talking about uh my taiji teacher Professor jinma ching he had that ability of his self to radiate into characters so wait, wait, you said it how could you tell that's what was happening well he was so good at so many different things in ways that seemed inhumanly possible any other way okay so he had the ability of shifting characters yes I mean in a country of a billion people he was the most famous painter the most famous poet and calligrapher the most famous Chinese doctor and one of the most famous taiji ambassadors yeah all at once we call that the uh Arnold pattern yeah bringing it down to American English an actor a politician and an actor he could do you know humorous roles or bad guy roles whatever okay and a hell of a good businessman and a top, bodybuilder those are four main pieces and he hit him all right doesn't mean you have to think much about Arnold but, that ability you know tells you he knew something he knew something he knew a bit of how this pattern worked and was able to work it that way yeah and that's what Bob said about Chen matching, ah who's a big name Chinese Tai Chi and also a big name as Bob was saying in some other fields yeah when somebody can do that kind of conclusion that they they've got something so they're a great this and a great bat and a great that all totally different things but they're great at all of them they know something about how it works okay yeah all right and, for some reason we have to with this variety of characters that you have to be even in the human existence again sometimes you have to be a worker a daddy a lover a decision maker about whatever or all right, to know when you're a job, when you're helping me here with the word avocation yeah we the CEO Big Boss he's pretty good at it he comes home and he tries to come home as a CEO the wife doesn't think much about him but she loves spending his money the kids since he's a bit of an ass but they'll wait till he dies and inherit his money uh he hasn't changed identities could we say when he comes home he ought to be ah the home person the daddy the, husband or whatever okay so our ability and this is a fun practice for humans in daily life you know we show you dumb little things to remind you I'm walking I reach the bottom of the stairs I take a moment easy I'm now going to become a stair climber being in my younger years up those stairs uh because I was a stair climber I just have fun hopping up those steps I'd look good, uh so those little practices are cool because when you get into bigger time or finer levels of things it would be very similar practices so any tricks patterns like that you play with and experience will hold you in good stead as you continue the journey okay yeah I'm pooping out yeah somebody something did we cover anything today yeah I think so dimensional more energies available it's just there okay it's I don't know I don't know I'm kind of hard so I thought stupidity that keeps us from accessing it's our hanging on to maybe a little bit of Twisted ideas or ideas that don't fit now, you're moving into this level easy let go of those Bobby's ideas to be a robber Robert's got to let go of Robert's View and sense of things to become a not do he has to let go to become Sensei and on and on and on and on and it's but some people are afraid to let go either they're comfortable at that level they're a very famous Robert who are they good at what they do is Robert and you say let go there's more they're afraid to let go for one reason because if I let go maybe I won't be this, good guy that I am and they afraid to let go and see if there's more okay so that could create a trick uh practice this in that sense with, things that aren't that important to you a certain way where it seems like that are important to you may be harder to let go of that to see what's next to hang out with that seemingly empty nothing down time before the next level boom shows it's there and who the character is in that next level who the self is in that next level the aliveness of the space in that next level the clearer sense of the design, of Creation in that next level and on and on and on ah thank you Sensei yeah thank you all anybody has something else they want to say, jump in it's Mike from New Zealand I was just going to say um that your example of the, walking and then getting to the steps and taking a moment and then becoming the stair climber is, actually the, live example or that I have at the moment um I have steps between my buildings and in the past when the injuries in my knees were more uh fresher I guess it could cause me considerable pain trying to take a step up the up the up the staircase but just recently I a nun climber trying to climb is hard and often damages himself can I say it that way yes, he who climbs and you give it some moment for the energy to mix properly and less likely you're going to hurt yourself and more likely you're going to be able to do it and not look too bad or something go ahead I'm sorry catch up no um so just recently I've I mean I've tried lots of different approaches like you know centering and, really trying to act as a unit and things but things but more recently I simply said to myself to my body um you've been walking for you know 78 years and you've been stair climbing for 70 years and you know how to do it there is no problem and so simply climb the stairs and when I can when I can act in that, character then yeah I walk up the stairs and there's no pain suggest an ad give them more room so the next level Walker could stair climber has room yeah, yes, uh yes, uh also I tend not to tell other pieces what to do and they how do you work or what can you do or what would be your way of approaching something like that I, sort of open to, the intelligence of the next level and let it say Okay early in my meditation years I don't know if I can remember the exact example right now but uh I knew I had my ideas so when I would first begin to meditate I, was very careful I come very early that I can't say I want this to happen and that to happen I learned to say show me how you work is probably the phrasing one example of what I used and show me how you work I know how I would like it to work but I also kind of recognize that was an eye, I know what I would like to have happen I'll let go of that you show me how you work, and I felt that Honesty it's got to be honest okay don't yourself here if you're gonna do anything like that I'm talking to everyone uh don't yourself if you want to be honest be honest okay be honest, be honest okay be honest uh, you're gonna ask anyway are we finished on that Mike hey Bob can I can I throw in a quick non-sequitur here we got to catch Mike while we can we need his approval to print his house Mike's already sent you a message to Richard I actually have the document open in front of me thank you thank you forgive me Bob thank you Sensei and thank you people see you at the dojo tomorrow yes sir you will thank you Sensei thank you everyone and good evening ciao

there we are hello, hello um I don't know if I'm as well prepared tonight as I should be so be it you are gonna help me anyway so it's okay maybe it's time for me to take another, weekend break let me think on that um, okay, roughly uh roughly uh okay so Center Circle okay and I thought Let's uh use the, a change of words here uh situation rips for the center uh character will rep for the center ah, see if I can say this well it seems that in knowing a bit about Center you know I should be centered on centered that we ensuring that word into fast too early we may not be allowing the character to get Fuller in that situation Fuller character who let's bring it in on the other side who has a center and can feel the center experiences Center but let's not bring in the word Center too fast I have a feeling in some cases many cases it interferes with the fullness of the character and brought in too fast it's not a full enough Center did I say that okay sort of kinda let me check with Brad, yeah okay it was okay for Brad it's okay for you guys so Basics I want to sort of start or even stay with the Human Condition Center in circle character in a situation, character okay um to facilitate better daily living to facilitate uh sort of practicing so when we go into finer, finer of that pattern uh you've got all your basics down okay so don't shun the beginning form let's call it the grammar school form if you don't have some decent grammar school I don't know if you're going to be able to get through high school and continuing you don't have the basics in high school I don't know if you're going to make it to the university so don't, put down the human level of things we're humans we're here situations are happening all the time and to learn to rise to the occasion that's the character rise to the occasion, oh okay oh okay so I wanna think on have you flavor uh again this again this situation changes a bit okay therefore by law the, Beats between those two by law energies are happening to make facilitate the character being proper for that situation okay that's the law a big circle uh the center will try to be balanced with it better Center better Circle uh so, there's a harmonious law that's very original but again let's bring it back to the Human Condition so situation and character, ah, help me before I say more stupid things it's sounding pretty good Sensei so far yeah, it's been a strange weekend ah yeah we should stand Sensei can I uh ask something here please, help you were talking about fullness the fullness of um of character uh maybe before we do the standing how would you suggest that, gets experienced how do we experience a greater fullness or a natural greater, fullness or a natural greater natural fullness of character the idea might be a beginning place but no continue, the vague first feeling of a character mixing I, kind of like this word mixing, I, kind of like this word mixing up a better Fuller character to be proper in that situation as you get into finer sensing uh that character is developing uh Fuller and Fuller so it's not an idea you're, too high we need to this is the stuff of creation also this, mix of a character in first the stuff of creation not just the idea of creation, not just the idea of creation which of course has some stuff in it but this is Major stuff okay uh we could say the idea has some experience but the Furler of the experience has within it some knowledge about it okay so that each have their major did I diverge with that okay not at all I think that's right on point yeah uh but I think the basics for those of you who are aikidoest uh, let's see Brad category, in a moment I'll borrowed Brad here yeah you can't see us understand my example here we go um okay let's say in this situation that the characters mixing into that one now here's the problem I do I learned to do that I do that I learn and I do it better and say no let's play this game that because of this situation the way Brad is setting up and the way Brad is moving in that the character would naturally move into that, okay you're following me so far now we want a fuller character so give me a moment I like to stretch things out here later it can be very fast and full but let's stretch it out uh in this situation a better character easy, since he's settling opening of course a sense that there's more energy is mixing others my words here mixing and creating a third character a former character it Not only was this front part's pretty strong but the back support part was pretty strong also uh so not a full character would be to follow a guy okay not a full character, polar and Fuller knees mixing up a better character a fuller character it feels more rounded than the, hips and things are churning that's why this technique is getting better because this character's scrolling, okay so in this situation this character okay and just giving yourself time to play with the Fuller of the character the Fuller okay not well what should I learn to do and should I should I go to the gym and exercise my arm uh, don't control it it's a law Energies are trying to mix up better for this situation and we're just playing the game that this is the proper system's reaction to that situational attack did I get anywhere with that t-shirt did I muck it up oh I think that you'd what you demonstrated in there was the, the whole system uh expressing you know that when you were talking about experiencing the, Fuller of the back part what I was seeing was your whole system was engaging it felt like coherent it was yeah the Fuller of the system the whole system yeah, and, then as a then as a after, instead of saying I've got to be centered here we pass on that is what I'm presenting tonight because I think it can kind of screw some people up how they do it their sense of it or something but to get the fullness of the character and then what I should have done right at the end there would say this Fuller character has a center and can look experience that center now I can say I am centered at this level you can feel his Center as the center of that fullness character oh okay so again I'm presenting that I think in knowing I should be centered that we potentially interfere with the fullness of the character okay we put so much I'm being centered that we interfere with the fullness of the character and thus the character and thus the character situational relationship is interfered with a bit okay, and I can see this on the map sometimes where the centered character okay or too much Center a certain way the characters separate from the situation is separate from UK something not quite there okay I hope I'm saying all these things right, uh, so let's get a fuller character first before we bring up the, word centered or the experience of the center is what I'm trying to say don't know if I'm doing well teachers you got anything more to say here, uh, let's see I Sensei it's Dusty I'll ask you something if that's okay, I really like what like the last week that I was here at least you were talking about the character in the self so I work with that a little bit more and like I really found there's a lot of uh a lot of characters like a lot of like the uh like how you can get really defined in a character like I'm just not going to be a real good listener I'm going to be a kind listener with empathy or so these you could build it up but so like the fullness of the character I feel like I've been practicing but yeah noticing how many characters there are all the time just driving with my daughter I said so it's good about this I'm like well I'm gonna just pause and feel who I'm being going inward and then and then yeah I don't know the guess I can build on that character yeah I mean right yeah the if you continue with character in that form you said it well I remember your words uh you were a listener I think you said yeah and then it kinda listeners yeah okay then with more empathy first the character is mixing and you say okay I'm not full yet but what am I experiencing is character oh better listener okay let's get a little more Let the character mix up even a bit more a little bit Fuller character better listener but he's a kind or whatever listener oh since there's been something added to it so yeah that's a that's a I think a good pattern when I do the techniques for example oh that felt pretty good but my back hip wasn't supporting me okay I settle and I open better mix up the character and the back hip supports that good settle and open better character and it mixes and this character has a back foot supporting the hip supporting the hand whatever, so yeah you kind of graduated that, way that's a good simple practice form okay it feels dynamic like it's and it's interesting too because my I want to ask you one more thing that's okay I added my yoga teachers been talking about yoga or uh Dynamic expansion and it kind of reminds me of the center and circle in some ways like this in expanding out then also coming in to your Center um and the whole process just feels Dynamic like the verb yeah anyways thank you we may have shifted to another area but yeah, yeah uh one way to look at in this case is the situation energies could we say move in towards the center character or what will soon be a character and go hey and the character suddenly responds because they're partners the situation and the character the circle and the center they're Partners yeah hey yeah hey and suddenly there's a fuller character there, so that in and back out beat is a natural beat early in creation so it's still here hey oh hey oh kind of thing yeah, yeah so if we can catch out how things work we can ride along with it we don't have to work as hard trying to recreate it or something it's working let me just easy, and I jump in with how it's working thank you ah so how are we um, how are we uh are we okay I don't know we covered it but it's been a while on situation, okay I had one uh I'm kind of slow sometimes I never particularly liked standing in line I kind of got okay so there I am at the bank which is a horrible thing you always have to wait there's always a long line so I thought well I'll go at a better hour where I don't expect too many people I never go on a Monday all the business guys are there with their endless amounts of coins and Shakes and whatever anyway so I picked the time I thought would be better, and it wasn't particularly so I'm standing in line yeah wait let me let me play with this so in that situation that often annoys me that should have told me something right there where's the energy to be annoyed coming from what is that really okay so I better play with this one I've seen it before I've experienced it before so I did this pattern of situation and character but I went a little deeper a little more open a little Fuller allowing the character little and again a little Fuller allowing the character well within a couple of moments uh a real calm character me was, there uh pretty easy pretty quick and the depth of his calmness in certain way surprised me I don't know why it should have but it did it was really a deep calm me in the bank in line oh yes of course what I miss that in the past anyway so that's a kind of a basic situation is in reference of the character, in reference to the situation natural law trying to go on so once we learn how it works we can work with it much easier and faster I don't have to disciple who should I be here in this situation you trust the bigger pattern of things you trust the harmonious laws of things that it will be oh Sensei talked about he didn't know what was going to happen he just trusted because of this inherent intelligence Harmony whatever that exists that in playing with working with allowing the process aha it should be much better I don't have to think how it should be better that's too slow that's and a dumb who's deciding Bobby, make any decision about who Robert should be or definitely who Nado should be is stupid where are we help Sensei this is Justin I think this goes back to what you were sharing with us a few weeks ago about easing the eye you know once that, uh I forget exactly how TJ frames it as a narrative there's a The Narrative mind or the storytelling about the things that we think are going on really obstructs the this the situation and character relationship there so that you're talking around it today and you really were very um anyway I think this is a big piece too as we the, eye is easy then the situation invites sort of the character to manifest in its fullness and we don't have to know what it is it'll, be some evident through our experiences what I wanted to say yeah uh for what good intense for anybody oh Sensei usually didn't know what was going on people would fly but he wasn't sure often after a demonstration he would say to somebody how was it how was it he wasn't that aware of what was working he just trusted it would work harmoniously in a protective way whatever, if that helps any uh but yeah anything easy the eye more room so that uh better larger let's say larger easy the eye so there can be more room so the larger sense of situation the character and character the situation has the stage to play on so yeah it took two different nights and tied them together I think here yeah don't go wrong with easy the eye and you can't go wrong with a little more room and now tonight we're saying now in a little more room whatever the Situation's going on the character is trying to be mixed my words mixed like creative, to be equal to that situation we, have it in our language he rose to the occasion the situation happened and this guy was there for it and he handled it well he did this fantastic thing he was just click, click we have all these stories we have a lot of phrasing about that about that okay so here we're just saying well this is how it works and if you play with it you can get very good at it but very fast eventually it's a very fast very fast eventually it's a very fast potential we have to be careful of that word for because people have a fast idea and they don't have the experience that's why we hang out that's why hang out and move and play to make sure I'm getting some experience in there otherwise it's going to be mental knowledge but no real capability yeah, you can teach it but you can't do it kind of thing you know yeah Bob yeah, no your example was perfect I, it was anticipating my sense of you know something happens a situation that I don't like and I start bitching about it and it's like that's your cue to mix up the character better which is exactly what you did yeah, we, yeah we, what should we say here it's good when we catch our cues my cue in the bank was I'm starting to get about being in a line hey that's a cue yeah there had to be some energy trying to do something for me to start to get a little yeah okay so whether you're getting or nervous or something that should be your cue so uh to recognize these things earlier so we can open to the process much faster yeah instead of being for an hour until you're exhausted being and then and then and then you sort of start to catch on hopefully oh why, wait the hour let's be a little ahead of the game here or something yeah uh thank you Steve anything more to add on that uh no that, was a sentence you just anticipated where my head was going with this whole thing and gave a perfect example yeah oh so anyway to reiterate in case you didn't hear it I'm thinking and being too aware of being centered that we throw that Center in too fast where it's a short Center as opposed to a full Center, as opposed to a full Center okay, and because it's a short Center you're interfering with the relationship of circle the center and center of the circle the full potential there you've, cut it in half or at least uh yeah, and you just potentially interfered with it, uh but by I'm playing this game here this week what I'm trying to present is by being the Fuller character first color character first and then registering the center that's there so the Fuller character has a center okay so I'm trying to bring that word Center in instead of this way I'm centered I got to be centered, I got to be centered uh we let it be the afterward it comes in the other way so to speak we change the timing of it I think that can be conducive, that's good word uh for people doing this better will learn properly that's about all I want to say tonight help Sensei this is Liam I'm sorry this is Liam, hi, um just from what you're saying um this is my uh feeling of that like I'll feel at least what you're talking about initially that it's coming in through the back and there's a kind of a permeableness the fullness and permeable permeableness the fullness and permeable like I'm letting it go first off from what you're saying too just keying in where am I at right now that feels really important because if I try to say oh I'm, this it's not it's not then I'm already on the wrong track I'm on that I'm Center I'm Center but if I'm letting in from my back for me that's where I feel that okay back letting in from the back could just be inferring for example because a tighter eye is kind of if I sort of physically show up tighter eye I get frontal the easy the eye you can see it in here it's, like open up a bit back here so that could just infer that by settling opening up my back it's already the space is opening up already, the space is opening up already easy the eye is happening already things can more naturally work so yeah you need any particular example or character or anything we're talking about there um yeah I guess I could say uh just before class started uh there was some work going on uh downstairs of my unit and just already kind of showing up there's a construction truck things are moved so I have to kind of Park and cover in the sidewalk and I'm already in that uh state of like it's supposed to be this way, and I'm kind of grumpy and uh and what I missed in that chance um I could catch myself enough to then say to the uh the guys who were doing the remodeling work downstairs hey next time can you make sure to put the trash cans here just so I can park right but I could have done more to kind of even go further to settle into myself acknowledge where I'm at in terms of I'm grumpy because things are out of place and then go and even just check in see how they're doing first before saying yeah even a small change there because even in saying that could you put the garbage cans over here or whatever uh if there's little still Grumpy in your voice don't catch that and it'll be like well yeah but screw you too right, yeah but uh to be a fuller character who probably would have presented that with a different tonality or something they'd catch that catch that you know and they'd respond better yeah, so, yeah so again as we get better at this we'll automatically do these things Fuller I just need to practice a little reminder kind of thing what I tell why I brought up the stupid Bank story right yeah just that extra minute there this is less than a minute but this is an old problem of mine I've never liked lines in an airport I approach being dangerous you know uh but to take that extra minute and say hey come on they was like wow the, depth of this calm this experience was like surprised me a bit oh he's really okay with this wow he is oh okay don't expect great things for me tonight I I'm a strange week I have a question is this Center feels like is there a cleansing to the circle part like they're related well what's that they're related they're Partners yeah okay other partners yeah see originally I don't think I'm backtrack there was one thing okay whatever name you want to put on it one thing, but to create it had to move into two things so that was part of its game plan oh we need two things so we can call the two things whatever you want to call them the grace he the great she the great Ying the great Yang the great idea the great stuff whatever word you like they just represent that one thing saying I'd like to create whatever it said about this and I have to do it in two pieces okay and all the way down the line of the vortex Tighter and Tighter sex is still a big thing I had a couple of doves in front of me today on my front porch they were doing their thing it's all the way down the line he was chasing her around and uh you know uh so two, things in the attraction to each other is natural that they want to come together and harmonize it is natural it's based on an original very original movement so once we catch this and get the flavor of it that should help us not work so hard I've got to bring these two forces together, it's like yeah relax easy give them a little room they want to get it on the center to the circle and the circle to the center they wanna hold hands they wanna go on a date they want to be nice with each other okay but if we get too tight and interfere in whatever way we interfere, in whatever way we interfere there's Discord and you feel it in your system you're not at ease with yourself you know up to the point of hating yourself trying to think he's like whoa that's, a very tight place where that's happening because really there is harmony balance okay whether you pick it up in a sense of an energy form or in a sound form uh whatever what we do is a chance you know I presented a yahi mommy chant uh, what I say I presented yayi as the center format blowing out to the circle mommy one and the mommy responds back with his mommy touches him let's call him, and he goes whoa and he responds back to her and she responds back to him and they keep going finer and finer in that response uh so it's only hard work to get started for that first you know minute or so to get started after that if we don't interfere too much this is what it's trying to do it's trying to unfold it's trying to clarify is trying to show its Harmony and its intelligence and its power and all that stuff yeah I like that originality that you said like it's yeah from the beginning but yeah, that feels right thank you yeah hi it's Mike, Mike indeed, um would you say that relationship is an essential element of character in other words the whole purpose of character is to provide an appropriate um I don't I don't really want to use the word response but we'll provide the right uh tools whatever you want to call them to be able to interact with whatever it is that you're needing to interact with there was something I skimmed in the paper today I can't remember exactly but it was on what you're saying ah, something about it I can't remember but something I'll try to paraphrase it to the effect that a person gains a lot by associating being social proper with other people that, oh it was an article about what is happiness and these guys at some University studied it for years and years and years and years and came up with this, relationship of a person to those around him, that, that, leads to a happiness a sense of whatever okayness I forget exactly I just skimmed the article I didn't really read it but uh is that where you're heading yes, um the, well in, listening to what you've been saying tonight the, issue of centering maybe being as you put say we've been emphasizing that a little bit too early in the process and my take on that is that to some extent centering is quite a, selfish personal process it isn't it yeah if it's done in a way that people just major in the center and worse than that they have a short Center let's say Okay dirt Center then it's very sort of protective okay and often those I centered people and don't have as much Social awareness social relationships as they should okay, yeah, yeah, we're not exam I'm uh started off as a center major I remember the times where I wasn't very social at all I was busy trying to continue to develop this Center so in many ways I wasn't social I'm just catching up now I can relate to that too but it also then seems to me that even character itself can also be quite a selfish thing if it is just well again if he's smart he's an you've got to have that relationship with, the situation outside of yourself before you can produce the appropriate character and the appropriate character can enable their the appropriate Center in fact um again yes a better character will have a natural Center for that size character that level of development of character his Center should be in accordance to it so I'm saying play with that because I think yes because I think in some cases the center word comes in too fast the hanging on to being centered comes in too fast and it sort of screws things up a little bit for some people a lot of people I don't know yeah I'll play with it yeah, you know I, agree I, have noticed in training in particular that there is very often very little relationship between UK and nage you know they're both being polite and friendly to each other at some level but when nage moves into and take control of the situation if you like there isn't a sense of them looking after okay after okay right yeah they're disconnected yeah, yeah, and certain way they don't care if you're ready they're going to hit you with their technique they don't care if you're new they're going to show off how good they are at their Tech taking on and on and on yes, and yes unfortunately yeah that's all thank you yeah thank you but yeah the Titan is craziness whatever shouldn't surprise us because again this tightening of the vortex into heavier and heavier uh yeah but just thank God within that is of opening to finer and finer and finer right here yeah so we'll take advantage of that and that okay and I think we'll, ride the ride better, where you'll try not to interfere with how it works a couple of tricks to ride the ride better, a couple of tricks to lessen the interference would be uh okay you got a Bobby set and whatever you're gonna trade them in next level for Robert but if you've got Bobby trying to figure out well who should Robert be um Bobby's interfering with Robert being there it sounds like Robert can't be there because Bobby's there trying to figure out what a better Bobby is I tried to brilliantly show that example in saying you can't get pregnant if you're pregnant now if you think that's brilliant are you thinking nothing can get mixed and be created a Robert if Bobby is there it's going to be a clearness and openness and allowing a trust whatever word you like so the naturalness of things can happen but if I don't trust it if I'm not sure it can't happen very well or at all I'm interfering so yeah and on and on so one of the things we try to do here is present some basic tricks of the trade because you'll need them all along the way, okay it's not just one level that, all along the way there'll be similar type of trick of the trade okay somebody out there I said say Bob here hey Bob when they connect two things uh you said when you were talking about the bank situation that you know and I think maybe with some others that it's only the first minute or two whatever time it is where it's difficult to bring these things together after that their natural inclination toward blending and Harmony takes over and Steve said which I thought was really good when you get that irritation Factor very early on that's your cue that something is happening and so it's in that first couple minutes of irritation where you have to do the recognition of what's going on and as soon as that happens as soon as you recognize it in a way Steve just said then that couple minutes melts away and, you're, on the road yeah and I hate that you're saying a couple of minutes to me that's already stretching it out too long whatever amount of time it is it's not very big okay uh let's see if there's no Sensei story will do us anything here uh okay so we're talking about uh, uh what Steve's word was what your word was what my word was about men and that the first sense of something whatever that we recognize it in a, better way and work with it utilize it whatever, since they told me story trying to make a point he's walking he's got a class of uh I guess they were military cadets and that's how I referred to Cadets and he had been teaching him for a bit uh but in class basic stuff kind of thing and some of them wanted they heard he was great of course or whatever and they wanted to check them out so out of this big group about a dozen 15 of them uh thought they would surprise attack him out of the blue okay, uh, Church walking down the street going to the, Cadet School and he gets a little surge of energy just a bit okay not knowing what's up or anything just a surge of any uh so I'd say no that flew them in there's something going on so he did his process boom bang and then suddenly there's all these guys coming at him from the alleyway, uh unexpected and all of that uh and he said but they were it's he said it was like again with the sense that he really didn't know what was going on but he said it was a sense of they were running around him and flying through the air the point I'm trying to make is his, I talked about getting in line okay and somebody else used another word for whatever uh and I'm trying to say that oh look at here's those sensei's catch he starts to feel extra energy happening, and set it a process right then okay, and then boom here's all these guys rushing at him does that sort of fit into anything, maybe I'll bring the story up in a different context another day but I think some of you like those Sensei stories don't say it's Justin I, say it can be uh even a game we play with ourself in our day like how much earlier today will I notice the feedback that's coming my way, am I going to wait till my Knuckles are white on the steering wheel that's way too long how much earlier today might I notice that if I'm in a conversation I have a restless leg well that's a sign that a fuller character might be useful here some room Etc how much earlier can I catch on to that feedback no it's a fun game I'm just yeah see people I love this guy why he plays every day he mugs on different games he could play to develop this I think that's cool I, like that yeah it's sort of my thing too so you could play a game it's not just for me Sensei if I'm explaining this trying to walk a client through it who's having anxiety they don't know anything about Aikido or Yin or Yang how do I package this stuff in a way that somebody else can also experience it for themselves at some level whatever that's going to be yeah so we make these little games as you've also demonstrated so I take a page out of your book to say the least, I make up words that I think can fit in and whatever yeah and we're gonna do talk Japanese to them yeah, oh yeah we call that uh anyway uh so that's something I wanted to say there uh oh so a game could be uh where uh set up say at the beginning of the day where I would like to pick up the first of any kind of annoyance could I use that word annoyance I'd like to feel my trigger of annoyance doesn't have to be a major not some of it nature but just that first little trigger and, see if during the day little triggers show and which time we can play easy see something about the situation and there's a character equal to an easy character, character to one to pick up things that you hadn't realized before okay or where something happening so playing the game up I'd like to feel even the first smaller presence of that, could be a fun game I could blow a day easy just running around with that all right and then maybe you get at a finer level where you're like oh Sensei and it's only ooh a lot of Energy's around huh boom bang and suddenly something's happening and he's got it already it's covered it's taken care of uh, so yeah play games run around how are we doing out there no, great insights I Sensei Bob again hey Bob I got a uh a story that kind of illustrates the point you were making uh famous Anthropologist named Edward Hall he actually coined the term nonverbal communication and wrote a famous book called the silent language about it but he told the story about a friend of his who was a psychiatrist worked in a mental hospital in New Mexico and he got beaten fairly badly a couple times by clients going off on him during his therapy session so he's trying to figure out how to how to avoid that happening again yeah what he came up with was he put his hand on his pulse while he was doing therapy and if his pulse started to pick up he knew he knew they were going to come in that's right or any for anything else yeah his pulse picked up and that clued him in yeah and you're talking about something for example of that yeah, yeah, no you know Sensei can do it check your bolts uh anyway I thought it was kind of a kids story yeah it is it is yeah, cute one uh I'm gonna fade here open Sensei um, It's Autumn I was curious so when you're opening to this situation which feels a little bit like opening to the space and you're allowing the character to emerge sometimes like the self and the character need balancing right there's something there no oh okay you're a little ahead of us um yeah let's go back again okay and bring me back to this point uh when you said open to the situation right I'm, not sure let's say if the word open to the situation uh as if I'm inviting it I think at first anyway I think maybe just recognition that oh it's situations changing, oh there's an attacker here whoa or a guy giving me the eye a certain way I think he's going to make a move on me um so I was just worried about the sense of being open to I mean I'm trying to think so I just want to say yeah notice it whatever register it but I'm not sure how you use any open or how people heard the word open is all I'm saying no you're bringing in the self here well we know it's here I didn't want to necessarily get into that piece of it uh I just wanted to work the character alone okay but we know you and I know that present underlying the character itself, okay, yeah, and I'm not sure what to say right now about that uh, I just wanted to stay with character okay characters development okay so as, like um I had a couple auditions this week and, um a lot of them had a lot of pressure um and I would get either kind of obviously, um sort of pushed in One Direction or the other to like kind of follow an Impulse that was maybe bigger than I had opened to the situation of or, sorry what where did you use not open but recognize the situation to be and that character didn't have enough time to adjust as I was kind of moving through the lines and doing that impulse that I thought was perhaps coming from self okay let's lay this out for the troops and for me I'm clear so there you are audition yeah, they present a situation to you right yeah, well right there's a situation in the play and then there's the situation of the audition there's a situation of the play and then there's the situation of the audition as well right not to confuse them well for I don't know don't we first have to get the character before we can check how the characters touching the audience, yeah, yeah, all right you got more see again it won't I interfere with the Fuller proper character, if I'm if I'm not spending any time there let's say and I'm worried about how I'm going to present to the audience I don't have a character is that is that not confusing in my system where are we bring me up to date here Autumn I get lost along the way yeah I'm with you I think so recognition of the situation and then there's a moment that you really have to get in touch with the character first before you worry about how it's moving anybody else or how it's affecting anybody else is kind of where we're at um but there's also um I was getting I think bumped out by both the pressure and the, next steps of, kind of the impulses that we're coming in okay hold it there let's, go over that piece there are you saying that okay here's the situation or the scene and now you need a character okay yes characters kind are you saying that in opening to the character so I use my words so the character can get mixed right there you were pushed yeah I think it hadn't had enough time enough room and maybe enough experience because yes, that would have been Baseline the say the character that was forming was maybe was maybe twice as big as what you expected so of course you're going to get books so that's where you have to practice yes, yeah, okay boom and, pretty full character doesn't mean she's perfect she might need a little, cleaning up the edges but basically she's kind of there uh you can get that good okay, okay, what's the general story about uh I think I mentioned it once on a Friday night I don't know anyway uh, a story about uh Japanese actor Miss Pune the actor and he was at a party and I don't know something came up where they asked him to show a character and he'd like turn around and in a moment turned back and he's already looking different mannerisms were everything was different oh VI was different and somebody else throughout another character he turned around boom Sonny's got the second character in full bloom he did quite a few and each one was different and proper and wow he sort of amazed him but that's a pro and with a little practice there you are we're working on it well you just kind of know how it works that uh you need more room so that'll be part of your, thing uh and the real open its trust because it is that the right character and you start to interfere can't grow because you're staring at it to death kind of thing you know, so a little practice of that, that's a fun day I do that kind of stuff a lot just practice with some stuff uh which is really great stuff because it's how things work so uh so yeah to practice so you get Fuller faster uh allow more in that moment uh stuff like, that so uh that's right up your alley I love it thank you where are we yeah now remember yourself is aligned pretty well and interested in the line of work you're in you're in so you could be getting an extra zap of energy because of that presence of self but again if that's so if that's so uh then in this opening and maybe you would want to include the self and the character that the self is allowing facilitating to be more fully present so you open a bit more inferring a finer Dimension when you use the word or sense of self that might facilitate, I don't know if I said that well can you say it again sorry it's really complex okay you got a character behind or underlying the character is a self okay a character has a certain amount of energy okay Bobby even has a certain amount of energy Robert has a bit more energy so the our personal and when we play this game our character has energy but in your case because yourself is very interested in this line of work that you're into possibly the self is there but the self has its own plus energy and it's more than down the line it's, more, okay, that's why I tried to have people use this for healing to get a sense of self-present because it's very alive its way and it facilitates the energy body of a human that's there the physical body of a human it's there it facilitates even though the energy body human body have their own or energy whatever their own amount of energy by the self being there I think facilitates and doubles up so to speak charges it more yeah, it's quite difficult to ground sometimes but that might just be sitting with the experience even more yeah and double keep working on your opening and the depth of the opening yeah, see this picture can you see this picture did it did it I didn't explain what I wanted but really I'd like to put him down much lower, they're reference more the ground effect uh putting them up high I'm afraid people would be more in the idea part so I use that and this so uh in opening mode excuse me I'm practicing dying here yeah so more open deeper roots so you get used to the bigger size you get used to the more energy that's going to be present so it doesn't blow you over or throw you up just practice it's kind of like bodybuilding you know 10 pounds is there you can't do 20 years impossible but you, do 20 in a an announcement 21 and then after a bit you're up to whatever uh one of the things I find interesting about practice and this is obviously something that can happen in like rehearsal right but um like just sitting and doing the meditation the character is quite gentle the self is the self and the character interaction is quite um relaxed but when I'm working on Shakespeare it's really big right so getting used to that and making sure that the situation is accurate or like creating that situation to be accurate right I think I missed part of that uh, Bob, say what she said I think my earring's going don't tell my wife she'll make me get a hearing aids oh yeah the, meditative practice is, kind of relaxed and easy and then you get into something big like Shakespeare and the energy level is, much bigger but of course you can call that up as a practice too and say okay now I'm gonna practice Shakespeare yeah okay let's go back, say that first part again the meditation the sitting and settling we're talking there Bob yes bear with me here okay so we're just doing some kind of aspect of easy settle open but we're not really, overtly opening to a character right that's what it says maybe we're laying the open groundwork so that there's room for a character to be there kind of thing uh so uh so if you were inferring that, easy should have helped in a certain way but not in the way directly with the character it's, maybe a preset a pre something that facilitates that you're opening more you're settling more okay but there's no character yet but because you've done a good job in opening the fullness of the character will come up a faster Fuller better is that little enough I'm following anything you said there or did I go off track yeah and where tonight comes in catching the um the, the sticky bits that the harder um like the pressure or the feeling that I have to do it right or the nerves when those come in that like the second that, happens physically or however that's, an opportunity to open more yeah and be careful of I gotta double check to see if I'm doing it right, could become an interference get a little careful there how you do that you know if the characters just beginning to form and, maybe have the few speaking words here at first uh and you throw those out too fast and you're checking to see what they sound like I think it's too early you're checking foreign it's like checking a lady who's one month pregnant as to what the sex of her baby is I don't think they can do that yet it's too early so what are we checking some examples sorry that's me uh, that's where the words trust come in and other uh give me all those words trust and well trust is certainly one of them give me give me all the others come on you can do it can do it uh well let's see what else could we say faith in the universe the unfolding of uh the principles of the universe stop don't go there get up programming I wanted something simple like always disgusting whatever it'll be proper hands, [Music], all right yeah oh thank you I think we also have to understand here that the same this kind of process that there is natural intelligence in all of this we use the words energy or energy mixing or stuff but within that it's intelligence okay yeah and as we get better at realizing because it happens over and over again kind of thing uh, then we're probably less apt to, check and see if it's right we trust the inner intelligence of it I mean I think again so we stop looking at it interfering in any way with it we trust it well since they use many different phrases to say that uh yeah but I it's like you would set it up let's say you know I set it up to happen but then you didn't interfere with the happening it would just happen okay and often he didn't know what happened yes instead even telling me the cadet story says people ask me you know whatever how I did that or something he said and certainly I I'm not sure it to me it felt like they were running around me and flying through the air yeah, so we had to make up stories to make people who ask them the question uh happy but he didn't really know all right you trust the intelligence and the Harmony and the whatever, of, this stuff and maybe at first that's not easy to do Bobby is still here trying to check things out whatever but was practice was practice was practice uh and then some things that give you some feedback uh how do I know I'm opening I don't know let me check easy oh and I register that sound that vibration okay yeah easy settle a little deeper easily open I've never been in the world of vibrations or chant or something easy and the next level of that easy I don't know what you can hear over there but much different here okay not perfect it was I started a little high with it or but it went on longer and resonated a bit different the, vibrational rate was finer so I'm getting feedback that I'm settled more that I open more I could just hear it okay or I have a good UK and I do my move and I settle and I open and then move and I say to him how is that better and that's why I'd love to have a good UK because he, can feel and say yes it was better I felt here the energy from your hips much more oh great thank you easy settle open one more time that same thing boom how was that one and I say yeah he lost it a bit oh okay and made it again boom wow and so I'd like a good UK you can really tell me what they're fully what they're feeling okay by the way I hate ookies are pink for me how good does it do me if you're gonna jump up in the air about with makes sense they look good don't do that we need the feedback okay I don't know if I helped Autumn but whatever feel free to come back at me again but again it's, sort of like exercise uh in fact this part we're talking about this uh oh since it refers to sometimes as a gymnasium the actual experience allowing of these Energies, okay, and I thought it's not, a bad word apparently yeah she's nice somebody whoa I'm good huh good evening this is Lauren Laurie I was late arriving so uh are you back home I am okay good evening good trip yes I did thank you a wonderful trip actually good I uh I saw many old friends and old colleagues that uh so it was a actually wonderful trip but tonight I, wanted to ask if we could add to this mix that you have here uh, ground because one ground because when I'm on the mat and I feel and go through a process of centering and the circle emerges I also feel what I used I word I call ground or grounded there's enormous ground yes yeah I wonder if you could you could speak to that no it's just uh there's a sense of deeper with the center of since I referred to it with the word roots, for me he brought up that word over and over again Roots infers this deeper, deeper uh so the first ground if I use that one is the tangible grounds that, I can feel and hear that ground, but as I open and do this uh deeper opening the sense of ground so even right now just funny around uh feels like not that wood floor I'm aware of that but it there's a sense of passing through that and I'd say I don't know at least six inches that's the wood floor is my sense so yeah ground is a uh a depth reference can be utilized all the way along the line yeah, and don't stop at any one level because the next level the ground has a sense of deeper yeah I guess what I'm what I'm feeling is that um Circle Center, you know you know creates groundedness I don't they seem to flow once they start going and the two beats are going ground appears maybe it's a way to, articulate it that they seem to uh build on each other so okay this size circle um, would have would have this level ground let's say whatever this level is okay easy more earlier more original Circle a little bit bigger oh yeah a little bit bigger and it's Center ground this feels dumb to do it's like no that's not right it feels more like that a floor level at least, so they stay in relationship yeah, they're Partners they want to stay in relationships so it's a matter of partaking of that happening and allowing that relationship by throwing the character in there to get some feedback that's an improvement of the character because the relationship of center circle, Center is better that's why again we can't stay in an eye level uh because in a certain way there's not enough room the eye the tight eye person could be aware of these words of space and center and all of that but ain't nothing going on here really not really tiny bit maybe okay but the easier the eye so there's more room so this is an actual experience blah, blah, blah, same old word people were running out of time, ah, do I want to take next Friday off you are certainly welcome to Sensei yeah let's take next Friday off just, cause, okay, thank you very much thanks for being here I hope you got something out of this I know it was kind of basic but I thought that turn around again not throwing a tight Center and too fast to get the character, character and character will catch its own Center that was a

anything please say something come on warm us up here uh some say we talked a little bit about how when you engage with energies of the self and kind of open up and start to soften and settle that more energies come in and not to let that push you out not to let that yeah um move you too much but let it kind of move through you and it wants to harmonize so letting that happen okay, again we're, going to go over a bit of that tonight uh there are there are okay let's start talking about tonight's uh increments of energy mapping that out a bit what I was thinking of uh again a lot of stuff we've covered uh but to remind you uh about some of the main uh increments, uh, okay and that we should practice with the earlier ones just for the practice okay so uh using a for me a uh more centered style my first style uh Bobby to Robert and I don't know at each Bobby has a certain amount of energy when he settles and opens uh wanting to be more there is the next Dimension I call it and in the next Dimension there are finer Energies okay now in that shift from Bobby to the Robert thighs with more energies again there could be a push it could be more activity which could rattle you get you spinning off into things, so uh so one of our first Basics here is easy settle open knowing that we're opening to more energy more energy is present, okay, easy, not just the idea of it we start with that's what I'm doing now I'm giving you the idea again uh but the feeling of it and then finer levels of feeling of it extensing sensing it okay and at that next level if you've done this approach properly you're okay with that level of energy it's present that level of energy and Boomer it's present it moves fully to the whole system okay now I'm talking about the center type because my first major okay, but those but those keep those things in mind me settling the opening the give it time to unfold itself show itself give it time to for lack of words mix itself, and as you experience that then there'll be more and more better sense of who you are in that case of Bobby to Robert okay the circular types and then again if, we're to continue on the centering style be nados how I presented Bobby Robert nado, and those are increments of energy okay are going to be there so be fairly versed in how that works so that you don't get pushed out uh think something's wrong uh what's even worse is thinking that, pushed you is bad that this a pair is, pure and Heavenly and this stuff that pushes so to speak is bad stuff the devil's on me or whatever easy it's the other half of the equation the awareness have the experiential half the experiential half is kind of behind the times a bit okay we've seen that Human Condition we seem to have progressed into awareness, awareness, uh and maybe not doing as well dimensionally finer and finer with that aspect as we could have are you following me I hope okay, uh, but anyway there's more clarity of the idea of it and then it's partner the energy of it it's the simple way I try to present that okay so Basics, basics, as we progress okay so let's say we've established using this diagram from whenever uh I was talking about the centered sort of approach, okay my style that was a sensei's first Style, as we grew as we grew we say wait a minute there's something else here and the situational or circular whatever you want to call it the world you're in that starts to potentially show that it's there in relationship so you mix up on Center a better person and better and better you may realize oh you have more job opportunities that come to you for example I did better on this centered style it's like excellent the situation the, opportunities that presented with that presentation of excellent presented itself to me I'm sort of had to happen could I say it that way okay so the better this is the better that is trying to relate but to know that and to play with it uh okay to uh help I don't know the word here activate it more it's all going on but we have to get involved for again for lack of words we have to get involved and activate we're not creating it it's there it's trying to go on but I've got to get out of a tight eye a weird Bobby I've definitely got to get out of out of him, so that these things that are here can begin to show how they work and show that they're here and improve me along the way okay as the centered me gets improved eventually the circle wants to show that it's there so there'll be this I'm going to call the circle energies in and out or out in it okay here's that I'm going to call this centered up and down okay so, uh so on the up and down dot, dot Bobby Robert not those how I presented it, there's an increment of energy uh know that be prepared for it open to it allow it uh for like the words let it mix and that, centered sense now the situation is trying to show it's there easy and we should do in our practice a uh ever finer dimensional process with that okay so here's my first sense of the situation I'm in okay easy settle with the since this is a finer dimension of that situation or whatever situation I started with easy infer finer dimensional level binder dimensional level in that situation how does it read what your sense of it okay let's say the situation wasn't the best as you do a couple of few beats or whatever, easy dimensional finer level beats, what's your sense of it now and it could be something like oh it's not as bad as I thought or it's not bad at all I can cope with the situation kind of thing okay so situational or circular has dimensional beats to it it's not just an awareness there's a sense experience of the situation, really okay all right as those two start to harmonize built into both of them is a desire to harmonize with the other one that's a law okay if I allow this to happen if I position myself know a few tricks here that the Fuller of the circle will equal to the center that's there the better Center that's there will try to equal to the circle that's there so whichever way you go at it centered a circle or Circle the center they're trying to harmonize at better levels they're trying to dance with each other can I say okay uh, did I get lost are we okay so far yeah, okay ha, ha let's see I, touched on the dimensionality of situation not sure how to present that or talk I'd like to talk more old a little bit more on that yeah it's uh okay using one from Oakland Amy I don't know if she's on tonight but she really likes being in the woods okay as soon as she's in the woods the woods situation affect her and she's real happy to be in the woods okay that is a good place for her she immediately is affected by that being in the woods ah, and starts to instantly feel better being in the woods kind of like in the woods who am I oh I'm the one that feels better that whatever breathes better, that whatever breathes better ah, inhales the flowering sense better or the pine trees whatever better okay now those that style person they should also play with finer Dimension okay it's the woods it's the trees it's whatever and go find her okay boom finer Dimension and a finer dimension of the woods boom and whatever your sense of it at that level finer okay and continuing that pattern so you have a finer, finer, of the situation potential okay and I'd like to include that, well for me it works fairly well in this situation who am I there is a, center to the situation not the main Center uh the up down Center but circular types situational types are present they, have a center okay, okay as they get finer and finer the other Center will start to show that it's there so there want to be I don't know is it a double up uh where the center of the circle and the center of the da, line, start to correspondence who am I now boom kind of thing but I say that almost okay is that is that coming across almost clear yeah, yeah uh Steve I asked Steve on a phone call uh I think I used the woods one as an example what places he really, happy with or just feels good being there and he said the baseball field because he loves to play ball okay, so there's a there's that the baseball field who am I I'm the guy that feels happier I correct me Steve if I don't say it right you're absolutely right okay and who am I I'm the guy who enjoys being on the baseball field playing ball or watching other guys playing ball or something you're, you're a character you're okay so the circular types are a character you're he who likes being on the baseball field okay now I suggested or I asked them I don't recall now uh the next finer Dimension yes it's a baseball field easy with the sense of now you're making a dimensional move next finder Dimension dimensional move next finder Dimension The Vibes are finer here at this finer level what's your sense of that, was the obvious baseball field what's your sense of that field now did I say that right Steve is that yeah, yeah and, uh could you give us an example could you give us an example of X level or so if you're doing that finer dimension of the baseball field yeah I was playing that as, you were speaking and the next level for me is community there's a community of, of baseball lovers it's sort of like and they jokingly say we're going to church because we play on Sunday but in fact it's, analogous to that because you are coming together uh with a common purpose a common love and, there's that bonding yeah and yeah and it's more social, yeah the team members or even the other team because they played ball too so there's even a little finer where oh they're included in our gathering kind of thing yeah [Music] uh by the way that, circular they're more social remember I started off more centered I wasn't particularly social certain way okay but the circular types are Morse social they're more socially aware naturally so okay so anyway so we have the Beats improving of the center types we have the Beats improving of this of the uh, circular types and eventually in Harmony in harmony they start to blend together they start to share so it's a certain level all right and I did I present that as an A B to the one did I present it that way no, you did last week or two weeks ago okay so I call one of them a the circular one let's say is a the centered one is b as the harmony of A and B start to be truly experienced centered to the circle, to the center but more fully on both of them more fully on both of them finer and finer dimensions on both of them not just the idea but more the experience the presence finer dimensional experience as they begin to harmonize I call that one that's a decent one okay and the decent one then we'll get into the underlying self which I call in this case two okay I won pretty good to underline two okay now let's stop with that are we okay so far sort of kinda now I want to just highlight tonight maybe repetitive but very important very important that at each, click that you do whether it's this style or that style whether Center type or Circle type there's going to be more energy there okay so of course be prepared be open for the more energy and open to the sense experience of the more energy okay, so on each increment expect more energy okay certain levels the energy gets quite strong, Okay so Okay so let's say you're a centered character and you've been centering and doing improving better and better and suddenly the circle says hey I've been here ever so long and you haven't really not really noticed me I know maybe go kabang on you saying I'm here when that happened to me it really threw me is what the hell because I had my thing set I had my centered really pretty good comfortable developing yes and suddenly something else started to happen I was like what the hell and, there's extra energy in it through me ah what the hell is this I don't know how long it took me to figure it out and rattled me that evening I'll tell you uh but anyway eventually whether it was in an hour or the next day or a week later or a month or whatever I started to figure it out oh that's that piece trying to show it's there, and of course it rattle me it had more energy than I was used to or a different kind of energy this was the energies of the circle their hair different than the energies of the center okay all right for me I would call the center more male kind of to start with and the circle more female okay uh Center more solo circular more social okay, uh so anyway when the uh if you're doing one of those two and the other one shows it's definitely gonna be an increment of energy and I just want to remind you and give you a heads up to be prepared when something like that is happening that, sense of oh it's an increment of energy and do your opening easy Don't Panic don't get pushed easy open it'll clarify what it is and how it works easy open a sense experience best you can as you continue sense experience it's clarifying in there, okay so you get uh so you have your minor bumps along the way Bobby to Robert Donato or one level of situation to another level of situation could be a bump there increment of energy next one increment of energy okay but certain ones like when the center and style and the circle style are coming together starting to share that's a big increment so in a certainly we have to be really settled open okay now watch out for the word open I don't mean open, and I'm going out to Nevada I'm living California I'm going out to Nevada now I'm opening to Minnesota I don't mean that kind of size it's an internal sensing more size but it's here and now okay, so definitely an increment of energy when those two are dancing creating a good I call it one a good one okay, yeah okay are we okay up to that point yeah, yeah Autumn you okay, I won't ask the New Zealand people if they're okay I will figure they are is there a response a little one oh hey Gina you okay yeah okay increments of energy ah now you get a good one a Harmony uh, maybe aside for a moment I, believe well since they was using uh well I can do it here uh was using uh this I call that addition sign and you see it yeah you can see it uh he used that one a lot and I do believe that that's what we're talking about that the fullness of this equal to the fullness of that is a very important, thing so that's your centered circle, Center really in harmony okay really experience yeah and I'm calling that one okay so he, uh if he would die stuff often use that, symbol there okay the next big increment of energy is when there's a, trade-in if you would or the one the one centered and circled, and centered the experience of that to trade in trade in for that, underlies it that that's here but it's underlying you can't you can't see it but it's here it underlies and we call that two and we call that the self okay, all right all right and the self and it's going to be a little more room so we can infer more energy because there's a little more room here and the self itself has its own energy okay let's call it an energy field excuse me Wendell follow through a little bit more on that but a few a field of energy itself is a field of energy okay so when I easy the one okay or the I at that level and I easy and open the self that's here can begin to show that it's here then can and as I hang out for a little bit easy again easy again feeling is too heavy a word but as I go feeling finer feeling there's an extra different kind of tingle, I don't know how to explain it but it for me the tingling felt a little bit different than the normal up the Body Energy tingling I'm sorry I can't explain it any better that's my experience but make sure I'm opening because I made the move from this one to the underlying to the self the self that's there it has more energy there's a sense of a little more room so I can infer just from that more energy be open don't let the energy on let me figure this out you're being pushed by the energy easy hang out sense experience it'll make itself understood through that form it's not like let me think about that you're going to get off from the Here and Now experience of it I don't mind thinking about it but I used to call that a coffee shop time okay, actual experience time was that actual experience time anyway the more Energies can bump you and if you don't know how it works you'll misunderstand gee I was doing pretty good I was squaring away and suddenly I got bumped and make up stories because you got bummed like oh uh like oh uh that's a bad part of me it doesn't want to get into spiritual stuff or whatever okay that must be the devil or boom it pushed me therefore it should mean I should be up out here because it pushed me up out here so this must be right you're like no, no, no, no so there's a potential bump or push probably quite likely and not knowing as you enter a larger space like that this is a big move it's not a Bobby to Robert move or a Robert de Nado move okay this is a big one you've had some practice doing Fuller of character centered and you've had some practice doing Fuller of the circular pattern you've had some practice with the combination when they begin to what's the word meld Together dance together be present together as one thing and then as that one thing who am I as that one thing so you've had practice in dealing with it now here's another major one an i or a one to an underlying self big time now big time really be open self okay easy go through your pattern I think itself yes good idea now feel easy settle feel well it feels a bit bigger here wherever I'm at okay finer feeling easy definitely something here I have a sense I can't prove it yet that it's, like warmer okay warmer a kind of a benevolent Warmness almost like something is sort of wanting to hug me a bit something like that easy it's okay oh let me think about that no, don't go up there stay with this stay with this finer experience from feeling fine or feeling to the experience the sensing fencing experience and as you hang out the self will clarify itself okay self-experiencing itself knows about itself just hang out don't be looking at it thinking about it and it's like you've cleared the decks for this fullness to be present and as you play it gets Fuller better positioning the sense it has for lack of words sense experiencing that so now we get a after a while with more practice you get uh a sense of let's call it a field energy field of self and when it's a position right it's directly here so it affects everything along the way let's keep it short we won't talk about all the multitude of energy bodies and finer energy bodies and stuff because so underlies this character in his world you see energy field self alive Glory that radiates, through here there, here this inner self radiates okay so I presented it a while back as a healing potential with, that instead of being outside coming at the body trying to get it to heal you move into finer and finer levels here using the self and the field of the self the juiciness liveness whatever that self has with itself its Energies that that's a finer more original and it radiates out so wherever I'm at to that one, ah after a while you're going to get fast don't try to beat this fast now that one to this one so let's call that uh whatever to get a decent one, trades in for two itself to the one two to the one, to the two, to the one this is just a short form there's a longer form that we'll get into after a while uh but this is what I'm playing with a lot okay see if the short form uh and produce for you uh, okay so an underlying field called self that's like energy field and it radiates okay, if somebody has a present uh, a live self they ought to begin to if you're sensitive to them you had to be able to say oh this one's kind of special, something special yeah and it means natural something this, this, glow there's something that is potential uh potentially seen sensed felt by people around not everybody some people are so heavy Christ walks down the street and they go ahead The Carpenter's Kid ah you know uh I'm Cheryl Sensei look like an old fool to some people who's that old man with the beard you know kind of thing those are more sensitive said whoa there's something going on here others said my first thought about him is where is this guy coming from what is he tapping that this that I can sense and see is there where is he coming from and see what's the inner location positioning that accounts for this guy and for the seeming magic stuff he could he could do enough he could do would happen because it is operating from that level okay oh how did that come out I'm gonna lose you along the way nope since I have a question yeah so positioned well at a sensing level can you talk a little bit about how helpful it can be to inquire of the situation characters energy to get a fuller sense of their story and the nutrients if you will that are involved I take them at one year at a time I think you threw a few at me and I got the crowded could you use one as an example, yeah so if, positioned well at a sensing level how helpful inquire inquiring or dialoguing with situation for example could be to get a fuller sense of the story that's involved at that level everything has Intelligence so a situation, okay, you can inquire of the situation say uh okay let's use a dumb example let's say so let's say an offer me situation is more waves of energy to rip for the situation, okay so I'm not seeing the baseball field I'm next I'm feeling a companionship or whatever uh next I'm feeling oh this is almost like a church there's something potentially a for like a word spiritual going on it's not just a dumb ball game there's something, going on here it's like a church he said okay finer and finer and finer uh so to inquire might be hey that's pretty cool could you show me even the next finder you could ask it that way okay, or, did I miss anything on that password it felt almost like it's kind of church-like wow yeah but hang out there uh milk it for more in case there's more I see say scrape the chocolate bowl that your mother made the chocolate cake in you got to scrape it and eat it that's what I do here I, scrape the bowl that's gonna be oh yeah chocolate let's move, I hang out anything else here let it be let it show Fuller if there's Fuller the shell remember a lot of people tend to be too fast the awareness types tend to be too fast oh yeah I got it I understand and they're out of the experience too fast too fast uh anyway uh go, ahead I've got lost there go there go well that was the gist of it just to we get a sense of what the story is but there are and there are Fuller levels of depth here and we can inquire hey I get a sense of this what do you mean by that tell me more about that situation if, you saw it experience it you didn't quite understand you can say hey this is what I felt experience but I couldn't quite catch it could you clarify it a bit for me listen to intelligence everything's intelligent it's okay yeah so yeah I don't mind talking to things letting them unfold more and experiencing them more as they unfold whatever they're unfolding that's sort of okay yes thank you let's just fit in yeah there's a little point in my career uh where people uh just happened a lot at essling uh I just lay out some stuff and it happened many, times oh you must have read that, book because you, said something similar no I don't at that time I wasn't reading any books perfectly uh somebody else oh you must have read this book because whatever you said something similar no I've never heard that book another for this book not the book that another person that book like no, the knowledge came from inner knowledge what you're talking about could you explain what's going on at this level a bit better and I'll try to experience it as best as I can could you clarify it for me that kind of saying yeah apparently a lot of people aren't used to doing this because they apparently thought you gotta re you gotta listen to the master or you've got to read a book to know about it and I know I'm out of that style now in those times that was my inquiry major time here's where I'm picking up my information here's where I'm really developing okay uh I, don't want people to think I, sat at the uh at uh the feet of osensei and ask some questions all day long day after day it never happened that way never right I would practice my inner work experience my inner work there's something wasn't clear after a few weeks or a month I'd say oh Sensei does it work this way what's going on and he'd say something I go okay and I'd go back home and for the next few weeks month I, play with it I delve in it I'd open to it and I had my own experience of it if I bumped it into another bump that I'd quite figure out idasco Sensei but it wasn't like all day and what about this and what about that what about this and what about that that's, that's, when are you going to experience critical a sense experience modality okay, it's like all knowledge with no settling opening actual experience eventually it'll get you into trouble and say you get expanded out here when this stuff really begins to want to show it's there what's gonna happen you're going to get bumped pretty heavy gonna scare the out of you You're Gonna Go Crazy commit suicide what dumb thing are you going to do when this big seemingly dark thing maybe at that level hits you, got no, sense no experience of oh dark easy allow the dark and through the dark there's a finer dimension which you open and experience and double check your experience and you're okay uh that they had don't read in The Human Condition sometimes start thinking about things and, and, wow if I were a, this WOW that'd be pretty good but what if I were that, would be even better what if I were that and we finally reached a point where we've expanded that, form of thinking about ourselves uh to the point where we scare ourselves is that you understand what I'm trying to say here yeah and start to scare yourself I actually didn't think about that that's something happened some energies could I say started to happen that scared you because you were starting to expand and expand and expand without letting the partner in and partaking of the partner also the fullness of things so I think we've scared ourselves is that is that where that phrasing comes from did I say it right yeah okay, [Music] Okay so, big increments when the combination of the a b the center style people and the circle style people and you start to catch on you got to play with both of them okay so the introduction from one if I'm a center type I was originally uh and the circle started to show there was a bump for, me I mentioned yeah it what the hell is that it was a bump for me, you start to catch what it is oh and you catch that the basics are the same settle and open it's finer energy dimensions of that okay so that's a major some people sort of are balanced pretty good with both to a certain size so I'm not sure to say about those people there's an increment when they go to the next size oh yeah and then anyway let's forget about those people for a bit uh back to uh the center types could get bumped when the circle shows the circle types could get bumped when a major of centers trying to show, okay, the next potential bump increment of energy will be as those two are merging and mixing and being whoever you are at that level that, fullness I call one okay that's incremented because you got two of them there and you're there with them you're it not I'm there with it you're it this is part and parcel of you okay, could be a bump there the next major bump will be or since they called this going more original, where you stop trying to get a super Robert or a Sensei, uh thing you stop on that we call it linear on that linear pattern and you go enough I've got enough I've got enough to, be sitting here centered and circled and circled and centered experienced okay good enough we're calling that one now more direct is one to the underlying to the self that's there and now you're on I don't know this pattern, okay, one to two and I'm playing a bit uh with two back to one okay just, to get comfortable uh see what shows experience what shows okay there's more but this is pretty good, where am I going where am I going okay so that's a big increment be ready for that one when it's time and it's happening make sure your Basics open Don't Panic I'm trying to figure things out too fast easy hang out let it easy let it go from thinking the feeling do much for you too heavy finer feeling to sensing fancy experience fencing experience okay so, I just wanted to remind you uh you see it, would be sad if you've done all this great work and you've made your move on self and, not know that it's more energy and maybe you get bumped by the uh a real aliveness itself has with itself, okay and think something's wrong or make up stories about it that aren't true, right so just a note next has more energy easy that'll open you see him deeper can't go wrong with it always a bit deeper hence that facilitates the fullness thing talk a bit about that another time okay so those are major increment bump places potentially along the way ah help me help me before I digress more Sensei um Sean here hey Sean there so when you're mentioning aliveness and the sense of um uh a fullness and I equate that with you know you say self I say soul but yeah whatever yeah and then and then there but there's a sense of uh intimacy there's a sense of um who are you talking about right here where are we so yes, yes itself has itself has a sense of what I'm making an approach opening to self, is beginning to show us something intimacy right there yes okay intimacy and, a sense of um familiarity like, you were saying a sense of at home I don't know I, say it should be it's yourself at home to the point of like welcoming like you're, so generous I use different words but I just said a few minutes ago the same damn thing yes, I, I try to use the same words differently yeah so once you get a sense I don't expect you to have exactly the same feeling yeah but they say oh yeah that's, what I was feeling yeah different words but oh yeah, let's not be dumb here people right, be dumb thank you yeah, have you finished with that yep okay, yeah, yeah you're going to sense things your own way uh these different parts uh the self um let's say the flavor let's say the flavor of self-senergy is a bit different than the flavor of a fuller characters energy different than the energy of that space has different than the energy of the construct let's change the format uh let's say an archetype I've been funning with is a Buddha wisdom calm wisdom the and let's look at them or experience them as an energy field that field Vibes a certain way okay if I have a character that's more Warrior related that's a power factor and let's and let's say there's a field there where, I'm placing Warriors of field and the field of energy from Warrior is a different than the Buddha's field of energy, okay so you're prepared for there to be changes, okay, and if you hang out and continue easy it'll explain itself more like why that way or how it works that way or something, did I say that piece right because that's a little different that okay for uh Autumn for example if she's got a character who's a uh I don't know a loving person character the energies that are going to be there would will be of that flavor okay if next there's a, tough lady harsh lady something uh there'll be a different flavor for that character so you expect the flavors to be different and you allow them because they're the flavor of that character okay right Autumn yes okay yes yeah uh, see again some poor people don't know energies are a foot inacting and if they had to be the bad guy and those energies are showing they freak out because they're, essentially nice guys and suddenly here's tough guy energies and they don't know what to make of it so they won't take those rules they're afraid of those rules, okay, I had an interesting experience this week where a teacher was telling me that when you have a sort of handle on the energies that are coming in and the activities then you're more able and ready to play the, darker characters but still you might be freaked out by it yeah because it's, for one thing it's different not your Norm I mean your Autumn my God uh but if it's a character yes it's not a normal one for you but it's Just Energy easy you know you know you're playing a role should be so if you're a good actress you have the ability of opening and allowing if you're not so good you only play nice girl role but you can't play any tough girl roles you limit the out of yourself right yeah anyway uh okay I got uh I run out I got lost where are we where are we where are we where are we where are we Sensei it's Justin again could you could we say that uh sometimes the intensity of energy might present like an agitating or uncomfortable but that the energy is not here to bother us but to do a job or to do some kind of work to bring some nutrients, and that the settling and opening can help us to find underneath that initial perhaps bump as you've been saying what the real story is here we can't stop it agitation we're not going to get the information we need a character situation yeah this is where the games I think we've done in the past uh probably when I wanted to go over again but I didn't get around to it uh where you're first playing the game of being kind of tight your first sense of Energies, of something eat oozing up from under and, play the game okay I'm at this level on this thing something's oozing now, play the game uh what is it and, why does it scare you or what's happening with that foreign it feels like it's gonna it feels like it's gonna it feels like it's cancerous and it's gonna eat my body up body up some kind of bacteria that's bad okay, at that level yes not easy we're talking about the same stuff but we're settling we're opening inferring a finer Dimension metal not just an idea I've got to actually settle and open and again I sometimes I'm pretty fast I'm trying not to be too fat with the sensible oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah and you're just doing it mentally this is an activity an active experience fencing okay, and hitting those same energies but at a finer dimensional level what are they now, okay now there won't be great buddies if you're doing this click at a time but they won't be quite as obnoxious okay, and you continue the next one the next level dimensional level what are those same energies at this level now it approaches benign is that the right word benign uh it approaches benign but you're not sure because the first one was horrible the second one wasn't a hell of a lot better and suddenly it's talking like it's kind of nice you don't believe it you think it's lying to you so you can get you okay but then you hit the fourth one and lo and behold you start to experience it more in son of a gun it is caring for you it is trying to help you whoa now you're on a roll you continue to the fifth one fifth one allowing more and more of this who am I here, ah, okay so that's kind of an old basic yeah it's a it's a fun game uh I, meant to do that pattern in some form with y'all uh and forgot, to do it maybe we'll run through it for uh for fun sometime, uh, talk to me what you got where are we increment know the spots where bigger increments may show be prepared for them okay, if they suddenly come out of nowhere and really hit you again you know the tricks whoa whatever it is it's big I better open here easy, it's so big and whoa it's pretty ah take an extra moments easy again open I'm sort of a hedging on the opening I'm opening a little bit but part of me is hanging back yeah of course of course easy what's going on okay something trying to talk to me through me something trying to show itself I'll do the best I can to give you room to talk easy, okay and I sometimes I talk to her say you know you scared the out of me could you hit me like gangbusters man you I was all over the place now tell me more truthfully what's up what's your real nature whatever I don't mind bullshitting with this stuff cheaper than TV it's you and you, and your inner world yeah anyway since they if, I could ask a question please this so the incremental mapping of the energy increments I, follow that how does that fit with something else you've talked about which is that you know uh oh Sensei calling Aikido the you know this uh the library the, laboratory and the gym are those increments is that what you're talking about no I have to get there those words came up when we started to play with stealth and that's a big jump so I call that a domain okay it's uh it's a world that's here but it underlies our obvious world could I say it that way anyway domain where the self begins to show you're in the area of domain, and other things will begin to show there that's where the importance of space as its own unit design as its own unit self as its own unit uh that's where that really starts to happen and wants to unfold more where am I going okay right there since I brought up uh that the library is like the ideas or knowledge see I'm, throwing you out Library stuff okay uh so Lauren when you say oh yes I'm following you I got it you got the library stuff now I expect and I hope all of you catch gotta settle and open and play and that's the laboratory you, you play with things you fun around you play with things Fuller extensed experience is what he calls a gymnasium where you experience the fullness of that world of that world you're in or that fullness of that aspect you're here in okay so the idea of a self playing around best you can to allow more self, itself we could call laboratory for now and then the fullness the X sensing experience itself is having and that's your experience yourself here Shelf, uh oh does that fit in does that come across okay yes and what I hearing it is that this, isn't really the Manifest Dimension but this is what's happening in the hidden Dimension this, playing this that's, right they said yes yeah, yeah, right makes sense thank you sensei yeah, we'll spend more time uh quote in the domain with self and circle uh again each having their own energy and, the slavers different for each one but they're all there let's say I think this is where we're heading I think so it's going to lay out uh soda, space, the character the self the self the design of things okay uh that and they're all have their own energy, based on what and eventually I'm going pretty far now do I want to say this eventually that's all traded in for the that, underlies this okay, uh which might be heading us into the heavenlies I don't want to go any further, oh yeah I know that okay I'm in heaven I'm Christ reincarnated you're this is take your time experience this experience this okay just the knowledge that's nice it's cool it's a library yes but there's these other couple of facets running around with it playing with it experiencing it finer, sense sensing experience be that, was a something different from you big be it just I can say uh Bob yes um I, just keep my, mind keeps going back to earlier you talked about the one going to the two and then coming back to the one and I was just kind of if you could say more about that it seems like you're talking about you know experiencing self and then coming back to character situation or I wasn't yeah okay let's see let's try it this way okay got a squared away self experience seemed pretty good pretty good pretty good okay say yes okay oh okay then you start to catch on there's a trade in there it's something underlying, because it's all over late underlying it's called itself it's yourself your soul whatever other words other religions use that unit okay and it's more alive and it's taste it's uh flavor is different okay and it's present and it underlies this one this first one okay and that's why I presented it as a quite likely a good healing form you get the self and it's alive in this actually present and the glow of it and the, radiation of it make up your own words there boom and because that's right here and the heavier me is here it radiates through me as a healing potential okay, is that is that so they're coming back and referencing the, character situation having experienced and, being in touch with self, seeing how characters affected by that uh, you know you know yeah but I wouldn't see we have to be careful how we say this because self now back to the character am I am I better are things happening better and you're suddenly you're back to being a one guy or less okay so be careful there don't take that here and don't even move out further and be careful be careful I'll try to say it better here so that field of self here alive, radiates true it's here it's here okay and it radiates through it three days through to one and one back to the two that radiates through I I'm not sure if I want to go into how hat you you'll see the changes you'll be aware of the changes you're not dumb so if there are changes you'll be aware of them rather than but don't come out and major in is it did it do anything and disconnect from self yeah, okay and, yeah what why overtly disconnect so one to two, to one but it's presence its presence okay, you know it's not like oh since they had this fantastic inner Plus stuff going on and that's it is it making my techniques better now I gotta focus on my techniques he's, gone right there he's gone he's an old man we're gonna nail his ass okay so you can't come out heavily and check that, okay this is here and it's we use the words like trusted or you know whatever trust a commie or trust the energies that are here that are here at this level, he did it overtly oh that guy looks like a swinger and that guy looks like a hitter and he didn't do that this was all happening okay and oftentimes when things were happening he didn't know how they happened or what happened even, when I knew him in a demo or something he'd say to azuke after how was that you didn't know things would happen you didn't say oh yeah and then I grabbed him and I turned them and I threw him okay he didn't know yeah because it was a happening so he was retaining his sense of self at that level at self plus, I was saying, did I say that right well yeah no I, I, get a lot of clarity from that I'm it's, it's just a matter of being aware of how character is impacted by self without, losing the fullness of your experience yeah you don't have to lose the presence of self yeah just practice, okay and if you drift off a bit into a one and less uh but you're you've been doing this for a while hey boom you hit it again you get fast at this everyone else be careful of fast because you I don't want you to have an idea oh yeah I understand I got it it's, not but fast because you you've walked this patch before you've done it again okay after a while hey, it almost becomes like a Shazam kind of thing it's because but because you've practiced uh the, movements for doing this am I saying that right yeah, it's, much clearer now yeah, I, part of this is what I used to refer to as a checkerboard Theory first, the um checkerboard what's the checkered checkers, the Checker can only move one move and one move and one move right yeah hello yeah yes then it reaches the end where it gets King now it can go I called this part of this that we're talking about the checkerboard Theory do your one at a time step at a time it's okay but after a bit there's the potential for Kimmy oh Sensei was fast Jesus he was fast he could go from this old man to God knows what he was there ushiba of Aikido in Aikido doesn't mean techniques in that level it's uh How the Universe Works the whole the whole conglomerate being there is that okay sort of kind of maybe eating up time a last couple minutes somebody something interesting to you important to you unclear to you oh wow to you something this is Justin again I this might be outside the scope of what we're talking about but since it relates to energy um could we talk about these the qualities of energy such as love Harmony intelligence power and how they interrelate with each other and how they partner for balancing one another in a situation yeah if you major in one like a lot of people like love or something uh any, one of them careful, uh as great as you know a lot of people love, is the only one if you major in one quite likely because there's at least four I look at it as some as propellers if you just get one uh you're gonna get spun off okay at least have two for balance love and uh what which quality comes to you right now a Harmony, okay, Harmony's bound let's try it Harmony, and what's its partner easy sense feel listened Harmony and I'm picking up Harmony and intelligence at the moment remember me and intelligence what to do with that balance because I don't know it's a short book yeah so your balance now what do you do with that balance of your intelligence those are my words I don't know if you use those words okay anyway you can't go wrong when you are digging one quality someplace in there uh see what its partner quality is okay, see all power alone the potential for me to be very destructive okay you think I'm overbearing now dear God if I majored in power dear God watch out anyway uh it has a partner okay yeah anyway just file that away when you get one you really like do, do someplace in there pitch to what onto what his partner is that's, nice to at least keep it to balance yeah and I think in the domain it'll probably go to the floor balance uh, but that's future work are we uh heading towards the end here yes, let's finish up then thank you thank you uh see you next week for the locals I'm teaching in San Francisco the last Sunday what is that the 26th 26 26th I'll do a class in San Francisco the 26th, okay, thank you belated birthday sensei yeah, yeah, he's reminding me I'm getting older and older I don't need that people wiser oh thank you yes thank you good night everyone thank you thank you good night everyone thank you everybody thank you Lord Sensei thank you very much

uh everybody seems to be liking it and uh, so yeah I think this is a basic diagram on that I want to go back over Basics hopefully I'll say it a bit better a little different angle or something uh but here we're, in The Human Condition I wake up in the morning and I'm Bobby me or Robert me I'm, me and I'm in my world my situation so that's where we all start okay yeah uh so we should be I don't know it's clear as possible on, those Basics uh so this here is the character, and this here is the situation or World he's in and so I believe what Bob is talking about is playing with uh situation changes a bit this character naturally changes a bit vice versa this character gets better let's say the situation can show an improved level uh so character and situation is where I'd like to hang out tonight but again somebody what you been doing you got any questions insights come on before it's coming Sensei this is Justin I first of all have missed you and missed hanging out with everybody on Friday nights, so I'm glad we're back glad everyone's healthy, um from what we can tell over here the last couple weeks I've been working with the in, relative intensity of energy field between situation and character and how they like to harmonize and gauging along the way with an observing mind a listening self if you will how available my character is for the situation and, trying to stay but listening again sensing any feedback that's coming up from what the energies are saying about how the situation character would prefer to be working together and at what intensity level again yeah badly available for that much so to say and getting there with increasing my capacity along the way and being very inviting of the, whole thing I yeah I think that's good if we and I think what I'm trying to do today by staying with what may seem simple old Basics but in Aikido for example we practice Basics day after day week after week month same dumb movement so to speak because there's something very important in Basics uh so uh Justin you said getting this character unit used to and open to the energies it has and the energy changes of a situational change and that they're, trying to work together and just to have a, better clearer not just idea about it but uh more and more uh a working level a feeling level later a sensing finer level uh that this is how it works okay that the changing situation character, gets improved whatever situation changes so that they're, in tandem the that they're trying to harmonize or balance better whatever word you want to use there is based on the very original Law okay out of the great one let's say broke up into two those two underlying those two is that one and they're, trying to, get to that level again of Harmony balance whatever word again so that the two will realize it's one and so it's, a built-in law okay but we have to put ourselves in play, aligned to that open to that play with it allow it not just the idea of it they will start with that that's, what this is this is an idea okay but now we have to begin to feel that we have to have to begin to feel that we have to begin to sense finer experience that so, so yeah any, games of uh what Bob no is doing in the nikeido class and what you're talking about yes a bit more used to it so it's more natural and available I will get quicker at it another, yeah somebody jumping come on I Sensei This is Dusty oh hey I like that drawing and I like what we've been working on with the character and the situation it feels like that the circle beyond the circle the circle beyond the circle and you're drawing they're like there's, like a weaving back and forth of Energies, like between the two circles almost like a cleansing and it's trying to like learn something okay, so I guess what I'm wondering is like when another Circle or energy comes into me like how to start I don't know it's like there's a circle within the circle and energy is going around and um let's, put it in your language on, you're in a classroom with a bunch of wild little kids yeah that's the situation, okay they're at a certain level of energy or the class represents a certain level of energy the situation and that touches you it affects you once we get these patterns better and better, who do I have to be with this class today or right now I'm being touched by energies from situation they touch my character Center self, and that one is affected by that and Rises to the occasion of balance so that the teacher you are more present balanced with the classroom and am I talking what you're talking about you are and I mean today I was in the classroom and it really what I'm appreciating is like, the small this is I'm new to aikido but like the small adjustments like a little bit of improvement goes a long ways oh yeah really helps yeah, honoring that so yeah um, but I, like that drawing and that's what I've been yes what we've been working with like that's what it's felt like as these energies going between the two circles and, in the earlier stages he said he's newer at this kind of thing in the earlier stages a little bit better how do you say that when it gets a little bit better well that's cool it can clue you in that you're heading on the right track yeah and then especially then if the next one gets a little bit better again probably definitely on the right track so don't step over ignore those little improvements they can be very important uh guiding signals uh to say yes, now shift over here a little bit and yes, yes kind of thing uh yeah and notice the little things uh if I'm doing Aikido for example and I have a lot of energy in my say upper back and that's pretty good easy quick settler whatever and suddenly I notice a little energy in the hips but see I noticed a little more energy in the hips so it's hips and back easy yeah it's time to get a little more uplift from under the ground a bit through my lower legs to my hips to my back oh boom but I notice it but that concludes me and that I'm on track because it got better and better and better so I know I'm on the right track in doing that Colleen that way yeah they no thank you I think it's with my life struggle like I don't like details in life and the little things Boggle me so yeah it's good practice thank you where are we where are we somebody come on people you know how to talk your mommy taught you how to talk come on okay sensei this is Linda I'll dive in with absolutely nothing brilliant to say um well we're starting from The Human Condition there so it's all right oh good thank God I think I can be part of that at least um I where I am right now and this the way I'm listening and exploring is um, is I've, I've sort of have a little more space right now I'm planning some things, um I've kind of opened up my vision in the last few weeks created a little physical and emotional space for myself so I'm kind of looking at what's next where am I going um you know what am I up to so no great discoveries just space for questions no cool uh because I've been hearing that this week last couple weeks from more, than one person uh there's more room or more space we call it space uh that really seems to be very helpful uh, Dusty that's a good one for you right or was a month ago should still be a good one uh that type of a little more room where how things work you know oh a bitter you better situation sensing a better situation, sensing a better situation better situation helping the, centered you so back and forth and forth and back uh but a little bit more room as starters is pretty cool so I mean it's easy the eyes settle open, to a little more room so the things that are there can begin to show if it's in the normal human condition I could push tighter in you know Robert to Bobby let's say uh I tend to take the breaks in and say no, no more tightness it's going to get really weird uh but uh but again that opening, where there's it's clearer, this stuff is clearer when there's a little more room if I'm boxed in I, don't I even forget what I'm talking about I don't know what I'm talking about kind of thing yeah that Nails it I've been feeling boxed in and now it's sort of there's a little more space yeah, thank you so a very simple beginning word for most everybody open and look a little more room okay it's a that's a good beginning I I'd say yeah, or one Steve were you bringing up more room space room space last week to me uh yeah last week this week, um, [Music], uh there were a couple of days where things were very hazy for me uh where uh um it took a while for me to get settled and, open um but, I've been working in fact today I you know I noticed the uh the circle uh Center Circle Harmony and I thought okay well let's, give that a little try and uh that seemed to help open, it up a little better um what I found and, what I was telling you last week is, that uh I oh uh easy settle open became a beginning Mantra and that I would really take my time with each part of those uh the easy get the face go, through the whole body and just uh easy it settle and then as, soon as I, got settled just asking for open to open it's it created that, sense of space it was it was like right there yeah as opposed to just kind of jumping in and thinking okay let's, do it, was a really um setting the stage so to speak and, that helped it gave, me a lot more uh, room yeah um space is shown a lot uh, pardon me not uh self uh excuse me and, it just seems to want a turn it seems to want uh want to get more and more of a turn uh making me more familiar with what what's uh What uh self is um in fact uh, I I've been went back and looked at this book that I read years ago called the impersonal life that uh creates that, uh that sense of I am that sense of, this something Beyond character and situation that starts to emerge and by, give by giving everything a proper turn it seems like self just wants to be there wants to show yeah that's, really uh I guess that's really what, happened most this week yeah I think again let's start with more room, uh settle easy settle open more room that whatever's important for you in the more room should begin to show but let's, not go to self yet let's keep it simpler uh in more room is it a time to acknowledge the centered character or does the situation want to show it can beat finer dimensionally and show itself finer okay but having more room you're giving whatever wants to have a turn room to present itself show itself be present with you yeah and, the giving the each of those like, you say the center and circle uh or character situation giving each of them their proper turn instead of rushing to some kind of a Destiny or not objective uh by, really giving each of those parts their own time yeah right there yes, uh what's our old word smudging yeah remember there their partner energy situation and character okay as we're setting it up uh but if you try to if someone tries to do both at the same time uh there could be a smudge there so I like what you're saying about give them each a turn or, let them present as they want to pre-present so we don't smudge them if I'm working character I want to change from a Bobby to a Robert or whatever to whatever I know I'm working this if I want to say no uh I want to be better in this situation and checking the situation out letting the situation show finer I'm working that so I don't want to smudge them I want to give the pieces their own full Turn full space yeah something like that yeah, I found that very, important to not because there's a tendency to want to get somewhere you know want something to happen and, I found it very helpful to just go through each of the parts that were there and give them a proper turn yeah, yeah and in doing that let's say you were trying to get to I don't know on a, better sense of being or what whatever okay uh okay uh okay now easy settle open and whatever presents itself is probably uh the piece heading towards your, goal of having a better sense of yourself or whatever, that, that, activity the pieces are, trying to help you move into finer and finer did I say that, yeah, yeah ah so, basic, basic but very critical and that but as we play with Basics even at simpler levels we get better at it faster at it we get we get better at it faster at it we get to, move through the finer Dimensions much, quicker but don't mind playing uh with some of the well to come heavier forms the first forms okay I don't know establish good practice patterns practice, what practice Brad I need a word practice in school what, exercising huh exercise train, I practice patterns so use Simple Things to improve your practice patterns like if it's time for centered character stuff fine hang out with it if it's time for how am I doing in the world what's My Philosophy what's my sense of the world you're looking for a word attitude with the world uh I'm gonna hang out with that for a bit I'm not going to do that for a quick second and then check me again and, and smudge them take your time take your time do a little, pieces are fine at first get to get the sense of it later again you'll get faster and finer really oh Sensei was fast okay but, take your time when it's time to take your time okay practice Yeah ah where are we okay let me see all right I did some notes you've seen around all that stuff uh so let's start from the human level we are characters in our world or situation, yeah the finer more original the more original of everything is like an energy vibration okay the all Spirit the all key they all whatever it's an energy vibration okay [Music] so if you get more balanced with yourself that's an energy vibration so we've played with energy moving up energy moving down just as a character practice okay and as the energies come up and the energies come down for it's just an idea and then as I begin to almost be able to feel the energies up and down he says I settle and open some more finer and finer I can sense those energies they may show themselves as a color this one will show a little different color or this one will say oh I'm the male and this one will say I'm the female and you can hear it in finer and finer okay when you get any degree of balance Harmony whatever word you want to use there not boppy anymore it's a Robert or it's not Robert anymore it's an odd doe or whatever so, that, balance Harmony of two Energies just on the character-centered lineage improves okay that was again my beginning basic I really liked it I really I thought developed fairly well okay and then uh the situational and energies some of you, are first on that uh Amy or Oakland you're on aren't you Shipley yes I'm here yeah the situation that you, liked one time you mentioned was being in the woods hmm yeah in the woods suddenly you feel better oh thank God I'm in the woods okay so far so good in that situation she feels better she feels better in that situation okay now uh for those of you who want to really develop more unfortunately we can't just stop there for our ongoing practice, but it gives you a, sense of a good practice place like I'd say so we continue a sense of okay words and birds chirping and squirrels running around with maybe a flower over there and a nice Bush over there yes but again that's your first okay now in a finer Dimension what is your sense of the woods in a finer dimension and you'll begin to feel the woods in a finer Dimension can you quickly hit me with an example let's see if I can do it fast on spontaneous like that, yeah I'm sorry people sometimes I'm fast but go sadly opening sure that there's calm there's uh something that just like it vibrates there's a vibration there that resonates okay let's just hold it there okay, so, I really I really like being in the woods okay good but let's not stop there because I feel better being in the woods that's cool that's a level of balance no because the situation Woods came up first uh let's work that one easy energies are beating and we get calm vibrational is that what you said yeah calm vibrational okay good now if we were to stop there I I'd say okay just at that level of calm vibrational what did that do for you the centered character, so we finish with the circle beats and said okay good that was nice that bead of calm vibrational now who are you so I'm more settled I'm usually running at like high octane like always buzzing and so this that was free before you got to the woods that was pre before I got to the woods yeah words was nice and now we're did one more click here so one more click is that I, feel more grounded and settled rounded around it and settled and again just to fill it out being more ground what does that do for you feeling more grounded now I'm more grounded but yes and who are you it gives me a wider perspective on the world I'm the one that has a wider perspective of the world hey now we're getting somewhere um okay yeah and Steve brought a baseball field as his woods and baseball players his Center I would do the same thing with Steve, in fact I think we did touch on it when we touched on your baseball playing the as that got better how did this baseball player get better and what's the view what's the baseball player's view of the world from that level and then the finer of baseball field dimensionally speaking so back and forth and fourth and back okay but doing them so we don't get confused when I'm doing more centered character I'm clear I'm doing the centered character I'm doing the situational beats I'm doing the situational beats so in a certain way it's not so much those so if you're going to work them fast back and forth be clear on which one you're working anything something like that, I say that or okay anybody want to jump in on anything that may have been said in that conversation thank you Amy I can jump in on that I'm a woodsy person, this is Elaine yes um I, um I, thoroughly enjoy the spaciousness of the Woods, and, and what's interesting I was running that same situation in the character process that you were doing with Amy and realized that I go to um sensitivity when I am really you know feeling in a centered place in the woods I feel like I, um you know it seems like birds don't bother to fly away, um things like that happen I, if you, know said nice thing where you put your hand on a tree and it's not so much that you're instantly sensing everything about the tree but the opportunity is there if you took the time yeah, it would be available and where that translates over for me I mean I take that with me to the office yeah if I'm in a space where, I, have a new client somebody who's unknown coming in particularly at that point but also with people who come in and I don't want to sort of uh anticipate that that's a really nice way for me to clear and just go to sensing and you know going from space to, character from situation to character, from situation to character there and it gets me out of being sort of in getting in tight and worrying about what's going to happen yeah um so it's interesting that, I, have that same appreciation as Amy but um we go to different places with it yeah, no you're all going to have your own place okay all right all right so baseball field woods and other Woods somebody just throw out some a classroom okay, somebody give me one more what's your place that's easy for you the ocean the ocean yeah and, when I used to go to esslin I noticed some days I'd be there and there's we'd hang over the ocean and we're right there there's the ocean and there'd be a week where I wouldn't even notice the ocean or vaguely okay but I would be noticing a tall tree another time I'd come down there and it was like Wow an ocean and I'd hang out with the ocean and I'd sort of blend with it and play with it so some, days were three days and some days of ocean days so Steve you're not only going to play on the baseball field there's other things you play with you know your guitar and whatever your music I was gonna say music studio a recording studio is, like or the woods for me too I you know or the ocean lots of places yeah so, you're going to have your common favorites or your first favorites but you're going to have more than one okay and did you notice with Elaine's dialogue how faster she's getting we put her in a more advanced category here how faster she she's getting from the woods to that, same level real quick with the new client, could you catch that in her inner dialogue, that I can do it there here click, click I'm at that same sensing level and I'm sensing this new client and as he inferred smoother faster easier just boom, so that's why I'm saying play more with the first simple things that come at you so that you get faster at it so at the more whatever important things or other things you're going to be fast with them I don't know if I said that well did I say that okay yeah all right all right okay so yeah I'll see oh since I said I was looking for a word earlier about the balance between situational energies and the character's energies historically we've called them a field of two fields of energy this is a this uh centered characters a field of energy the situation is a field of energy those two fields are related to each other okay, um, and the harmony or balance you know what wordo Sensei likes there he said it um when there is a what, I call balance or Harmony he called it uh um it hums for him which indicates that he liked the vibrational sense of things that sense feeling hearing finer of the hum, of what we originally called balance or Harmony, okay uh, we laid this out with the a b uh doesn't matter which is whatever let's say a is the character B is the situation as the A and B start to hang out with each other you get to one all right all right so that's the uh the humming Place let's say, and don't be different levels at first uh be a level of a hum so you're probably be what uh, uh a character comfortable in his world in his world this character is comfortable things like, that hey the reason I kind of created the ab1 is though since I like to throw likes to throw a lot of numbers around he's got certain patterns um which in communicating got a little confusing, uh I don't remember even what he said now but something like uh this and that is not two it's one right you got one over here and one over there and now it's one or something and anyway so I said I think it'll be easier to say that's a and that's B Harmony of those the hum of those two together at a certain level of Talent where they're humming that's one okay, okay so you've got a Bobby one potentially hold on if Bobby could pull it off very well a Robert level of one the A and B are humming and there's a one if Robert couldn't pick it up I move on to Robert level and Robert starts it should be able to pick it up okay uh so there's uh, that pattern a b to one okay later when we go back at the self on call that too one is a very good location a very good positioning for the next very important thing the self that underlies one a b okay, that extra oomph if we're doing it in energy character as energy situation as energy the two energy Fields mix whatever blend harmonize, um, one, has a certain amount of hum it's not because you've got a and b hum the one hum is a bit but a finer let's say a bit larger or present boom okay when the one trades into more original not to the next level on the next level meaning Nado, Sensei nados we can go on that track for a hell of a long time too long enough is enough okay so I'm saying for me Robert should be more than enough and yet Bobby can pick it up now he's getting cool okay Robert definitely uh the underlying self energy is much more original and full so that two of self's Fuller energy underlies the one a b of that, we use to get there it's underlies uh so did I say anything intelligent did I lose you yeah Bob you're gonna give me thumbs up on if I uh anyway Basics are good don't sell them short practice easy just get to the place where the sense of character the life itself but it's open to input so when there's input changing circumstances that the character goes oh okay and immediately harmonizes with that and is present with that equal to that or vice versa okay basic yeah if there's something about Basics you don't catch get, on me because these are basic you okay all right ah and again outside say like the I call it addition sign that was one of his basic favorites okay, uh that's the harmony of situation character, okay, or you work the center and you work the situation or vice versa worked the situation and then the center okay uh foreign plan picture I seem to have mislocated or maybe the book people took it uh for the book uh but anyway the Potted Plant I thought oh it's kind of sharp the plant by itself is like not quite the pot with fertile soil in it by itself is yeah but not quite but the combination the situational potted plant with, soil nutrients as a relationship to the plant the plant that the nutrients, to the plant there's this relationship so that's a that's a pretty nice image to cover the relationship uh between character and situation I, thought so I really like the Simplicity of Pate plant okay, if the plant says I'm feeling a little weak or a little tired if it catches this process that message is sent to the pot nutrients and say hey help and boom they're there and the plant picks it up experiences it says thank you I feel better and on and on and on and on okay so very simple image that we can easily sense and easily duplicate you can stand there and move your arms and just be a plant in a fertile pot and use that but just be clear on which piece you're working now I'm the plant okay you hang out with yourself feel it yourself feel something is lacking or something okay the message is sent to the fertile soil of the pot easy hang out with that for a moment and that relates to the plant so plant to the pot, back to the plant they have a relationship uh so not just oh yeah I got the idea I understand yes that's the Library part but we've got to fun around a bit and really experience so we got the laboratory fun around a bit and then really, Fuller experiencing this we've got gymnasium okay so it's not just you can memorize all this stuff and expect anything much to happen you might get a little dribble down but not anywhere near not anywhere near we have to practice or come up with your own practice routines you like chanting for vibrational chant okay for a long period of time I love gonging the gong so now I would it's been many years but now I would say I've gone to gong what is that is that the situational Energies if, I'm playing it that way gone and after a bit I might again say okay that's the situational Vibe and you hang out there for whatever five minutes 10 minutes 50 whatever really feeling those vibrations what does that do for me who am I now so I get both the practice of the situational gong and how it affects me character or you could probably do it the other way around way around with the gong is more personal that's me vibrating okay and after a while of that ah feeling experiencing those vibrations using bodies of reference ah now what's my sense of the world what's My Philosophy what's my attitude towards the world what's going on kind of thing so either or either or works both ways okay so in my note since forever I've got a lot of VV and vice versa so if I say Center Circle and I have an extra DV vice versa it works the other way also yeah it might Center work I always start from under up, down somebody else may say no it's down up whatever he says Ah be consistent that's important be consistent if after a while in practicing something keeps reoccurring, like instead of gee I used to always do energy down but I want to do energy up or something well play with it trust it see what happens, okay it may be correcting you or it may be saying yes good but now there's more if we look at it this way the more it can show better for you whatever I don't know sometimes I just jump in and play see with the sense I was trying to show something let me hang out open some more clear some more and let it try to show itself, let it clarify itself easy let it off to me okay sense experience it we have to play we have to play we have to play so not just memorization not just my diagrams, uh they're nice they remind me to do something, okay to play and they remind me after a bit that this has to be more experienced so the remind me Library laboratory gymnasium where the hell are we so anyway all the patterns we're basically saying the same thing uh bad day fair day good day basically saying the same thing okay that as you move into a two by two okay not just uh and I'm again a centered first type uh I feel a bit better I can straighten up or as a one by one is kind of punched in a bit Two by Two start to breathe better stand a bit better uh and I always add and what's my sense of the world it's my philosophy what's my view okay to include not just the character but the realm he's in the world he's in the situation he's in and I'd ask those other people are Circle types to do the reverse of that here uh what we did with Amy in the woods now you feel better now finer dimension of the woods the situation finer dimension that a hum for her revive or whatever okay now let's go back to this one who are you now and begin to feel now I mean I don't know let me think about it no, no, feel experience you can repeat that here's my notes on it from today in doing up down centered person I'd like to add uh what is my sense of the situation my philosophy of the world in doing an in and out of direct for the situation uh at a more harmonious level I like to add who am I the centered person here with experiential feeling I believe we said that to Amy talk to me talk to me talk to me Basics are important Sensei it's Bill Huey in San Diego I just want to say how you haven't seen you in a while who's this Bill Huey hi Bill hi Bill gotcha yeah uh I wanted to tell you that I'm up for need on and my test was supposed to be tomorrow but I delayed it uh week because I was sick and you had a non-trivial influence on me on in my keto development and uh I saw I have a I have a um of a model I'll call it my inner Nado and the inner Nado has a front a back and a left and a right and uh I use that model in order to check for fullness in my uh in what I do technique and I've seen I guess you call that character I've seen that breakdown a couple of times and I've had it had to add are the qualities in order to receive better so that so I can be Fuller and one of them is a water quality from, Patrick Cassidy Sensei where um where um where if I receive more on a technique I have better extension better back better front and forward and so um that's something I've been uh I've been really kind of exploring in the my need on training and um it's been busting my balls so um I was thinking about you the entire time I've been training so I just want to could I could I can I say an important piece there I think for you especially here uh five cents right now the important piece is to uh to uh Own It careful of that word people use it in a weird way Own It own it uh situation sends energy the test or an okay boom sends energy to the nage you and you're getting more energy uh to own it personalize it uh one way is to use it as a core field of energy first levels a core kind of I love so me with this energy with this energy me but it's inner it's me it's me boom, okay I'd say I would even like you to drop the na doe and go for uh the energy you right I'll just I'm just in an adult because that's the model I use uh yeah no that's cool that's cool but you it's kind of important I may not feel you enough by doing a model, oh Sensei told me more than once not, though I'm so happy you like me and love me and all that uh but you gotta do you they're busting my balls down in San Diego I, don't know how to not do me at this particular time and including the Panic sometimes I feel doing technique you know like the on the indecision and things like that that's something I gotta work on okay suggests panic and in a dojo situation it's just more Energies right that have to be uh for like a word mixed and this is me this is me if you don't open to them and allow them to mix they come at me and they Panic me leave me alone you got to be internalized rain down boom it's kind of like a balloon it's inflating you from internal not a mental inflation boom, boom okay and if you get if you get pushed by your own energies or whatever you said no, buy them uh just means hey you gotta open up some more if I get small my own energies will bury me, I've gotta I've tried to uh I my what I'm trying to do right now is trying to be okay with the tension and okay with the energy and, then I find that if I, wouldn't say in a trivial way I once I don't want to say relax but if I allow myself to receive the energy is Just Energy and it's okay that's what I've that's what I'm learning right now okay sounds right yeah, the energy of situation from the potted plant nutrients are coming yes now the plant says thank you opens through them and grows bigger and better thank you thank you and at that moment they're in harmony could I say the plant is equal to the what the nutrients are potted plant yeah that's basically a potted plant pattern but come up with your own sense I think pot of Clan is easy it's simple but you, play okay thank you very much okay good to talk to you yeah long time uh somebody, wake me up here come on Oakland's Oakland I don't know the, last speaker brought up in a very interesting point so I wanted to just I mean it was it kind of made me chew on something so um let's say that potted plant is in a pot and it's in a pot oh really okay we all are go ahead it's growing and it wants to get bigger it wants to be a bigger tree it wants to be a stronger tree and the pot is still the pot and it's like how do you break the pot or maybe you don't right wait, wait, wait this is dimensionality this is why we're talking at the beginning about the or whatever said a easy settle open more room more room more room so the pot needs to is in a dimensional it's in a dimensional like everything else here yeah, with this amount of room I, I can't quite straighten up enough or you know get enough, guts or something okay easy settle open easy now this is dimensional for the space pot easy settle open and starting to Surge already exactly my fingertips getting a little warmer and got a bit easy I'm like breathing it in taking it I call that slurpee you've heard me because when I Slurpee so the pot is dimensional okay yeah uh so I guess let me say and then you can jump in uh, the plant can outrun the pot, I want to be a tree and it's only a little tiny shrub I'm going to be a tree well, that's sort of out of a chord could I say with the size pot it's in so let's do this properly yeah yes but you're, right did you want to be more then this circumstance is pot yeah it needs to be more and it it's there it's available it's all there okay but dimensionally we have right no that makes me think because um when uh like I have a goal right I have this I want to be this I want to reach this goal right achieve something um but physically I'm not capable of it then if I keep working at that that's when injury happens right or that's when something happens where the gift of injury I guess is kind of where you shift to the downtime and you're like oh I, now I can be a little bit no we'd say you bit off more than you could chew how do we know that you hurt yourself right it's not you got hurt you hurt yourself your own system so you know you're out running me trip drop that weight on your foot or some damn thing yeah but those are nice times to also like oh okay I'm injured which sucks but to reopen what if we go back okay you want to attain something what if you try just a little bite and practice with that instead of the big bite that you'd like to attain what if the little Bush says well I just want a little flowering on the bush no it's just practice we, know the bush can do much more because I'm not going to be a sequoia tree and I'm too big too big it's not going to work um or if you just add a little something and play practice there with that little something and see if you get any results with that little bit yeah that makes sense yeah, no I think in The Human Condition we have a potential to outrun ourselves so somebody's going to take this or if we got into uh, uh something like uh imagine yourself rich and by the by the way the laws work there ought to be energy equal to that, will supply that make that happen they won't start with a hundred dollars or whatever for practice so yes a billionaire yes it's too big a jump you know you go for that much stuff and you're getting this much stuff you can't handle that much stuff you have no practice, so play with the little things play with the little thing don't sell the little the little thing don't sell the little things short it's practice it's practice it's practice if, the whole creation kind of thing is up all energy let's say uh you just can't say okay give me the all energy that's why it's running into the sun saying I want uh whatever the sun is uh I want to be sunnier and you run into the sun you're gonna burn away here right but you take a little a little warmth or, a little bit of light you practice with it can you get sort of used to that much lighter warmth or whatever and then you go for the next piece Bobby Robert Nado a one by two by three by we need practice in The Human Condition especially, to get used to and comfortable with how it works and learn things like uh how not to bite off too much how to how to work it knowing it's going to get faster and better yes but, not necessarily on your first shot or kind of thing you know yeah something like that thank you play and let me know how you're doing yeah right Amy back again yes what area could you tell me what area we're talking about are we into lifting weight shares yeah I want to be stronger there's a straight goal that I have yeah hey hang on a second you've got to open the depth the sense of depth and the openness of the depth more yeah you can't have your feet just on the ground, and want to be stronger sense of deeper and open deep and more opening, okay, a deeper darker nutrients in the in the pot deeper darker nutrients I, have a feeling you're not taking those into consideration so the, nutrients of the deeper darker lower in the pot aren't coming into the system, okay, play with that yeah I will play with that and keep, in touch okay, oh I think I'll be teaching in San Francisco the 30th I think the last Sunday okay 30th I have to double check with uh Ross but uh I think so I'm trying for it we'll see if Ross is okay with that oh, okay people uh thank you Amy that was that was that was cool so Basics, Basics practice train situational Yeah the more I think about it the more I really like the Potted Plant sense it's so simple if you actually practice you see oh yeah nutrients in the pot oh yeah no you gotta stand there and sense deeper into your pot you got to open up deeper into your pot so deeper and more open well since they over and over go for the roots NADA Roots, deeper, okay remember a lot of us tend to be uh upper, upper and we either aren't aware of the importance of deeper or because we aren't aware at first the heavier dimensions of deeper or ugly That's What I Call it's ugly or that's where the snakes were biting me, or think whoever knows uh the wild animals were biting her that's the ugliness of the energy at every level yeah okay but you know the game settle we're going dimensionally open and it's getting a minute and whatever some minutes there easy it inferring opening it to finer opening into finer now at that level of finer that, was what is it at this level this level and it should start to if you're doing this right show you it's starting to change okay, so but you gotta practice I tell you my stories about the snakes and the, underworld and stuff like that but you have to play it's not just an idea that's a start that's to get the game going you have an idea you read something you heard something, something you heard something, cut your attention yes okay now you gotta practice you gotta fun you got a laboratory, you gotta get involved you gotta you gotta get involved you gotta something whatever word you like there right so for everyone the deeper and the dimensional sense of deeper and the finer because it's going finer dimensionally the finer the finer the finer, they're for everybody in uh Dr Alexander's book what was the name of that uh, proof of heaven Sensei proof of heaven uh he runs into dark he passes over right uh temporarily and he runs into dark and it's icky scaly things icky he wanted out of there itchy cleared a bit some stuff came back to a dark again but it was a better dimension of dark he says oh this is not too bad I kind of like it boom there it is there it is he hit it under at a heavier level icky get me out of here, came back at it at a finer level and the more truthfulness of that through the dark could show it was it was better nicer he was okay with it and there's more yeah Bob you never tracked that Saint I forget her name Theresa who, was it say Teresa of Avila you never tracked uh red if she followed that wild animal to the next and next the Sheep I believe she did but I, didn't get the details that you asked before I need details foreign, I'll try again okay I, think I think I think tonight really what I would just want to emphasize is sense feeling of a character and whatever form energy field whatever and situation energy and the energy to the energy and energy and the energy to the energy and energy to the energy there's a harmonious oh sensical um level okay and for a while continue that pattern that this to that and that to this potted plant uh one by two or two by space where the center circle stuff can show to a three by where it gets the, center circle gets the show at a finer level boom, so the character is better the world it's in is better and clearer simple Basics but I would like I don't know I think I'd like us to have a I, think something Justin is trying to say where uh, Justin maybe help me here with this daily practice or daily sense of this to that and that to the this and that he's open to it and he's prepared to recognize which is coming at him, and to oh yes and yes and yes then yes uh that we get to a place where it's a little more what's the word a little, more what's the word a little more a happening a little more about here and now a practice uh I need a word I can't come up with like sustainable personally sustainable yeah I want something that brings us closer to this sense to get a little and let's say further way further away from just the idea of it a little bit more into the I don't know hanging out with it on a daily basis oh yeah I'm this and I exist in that easy but I know if that changes this will want to change to be equally balanced with it and as this improves and vice versa that will want to improve to be more balanced with me kind of thing okay dynamic yeah whatever um seems like hello, can you hear me smudging a bit Danny, okay yeah all right um for me the, practice that we're talking about has become like a kind of a default setting that I go to I, had to um have a um have a um what they call a pet scan you can go into a machine recently and I thought I was pretty well prepared for it but if I found that I wasn't when they laid me on the table they strapped me into this table so I couldn't, move at all and then they said this is going to take 30 minutes and that everyone left the room because I was radioactive they pumped some material into me I thought how much how do I do 30 minutes of this I can't move this is this is crap but immediately I went to I, just started to I said to myself easy Danny easy, easy and I started to just quietly chant a o to myself and I, I still as I was doing I could still feel this pressure on me it felt like a pressure that I imagined maybe birth might be like but here I I'm tied in I've got no room to move it's hot and I don't know when the change happens but I I've felt almost like there was no time that I was out of time I I'd gone out of this, um constriction okay hold that one, second so what we're talking about here for this moment right here where time changes the balance situation changed the there was some balance between a situation and Danny and Danny in the situation and he hit that spot where whoa, this time has really changed here so that was an example for that level yeah go ahead yeah and um it didn't become Pleasant I, still knew where I was but in, this almost timeless um space I was able to feel like I had more room and, I wasn't constricted by time because this 30 minutes was freaking me out and, before I knew it, was over I was out and interestingly I had to go out the back door because I'm not allowed to go past pregnant woman yeah you're radioactive right out the back door so I had to walk all the way around this building and I'm, thinking uh this has taken me a long time but as soon as I got to where my pre-arage time to be picked up as I came around the corner my pickup vehicle came at the same time and it's just I know it's just an example for me of being in a really a situation where um it wasn't even a one by one before we all couldn't even get into a one by one but that there you were yeah distracted and um yeah that okay I have thought what would have I, had done if I didn't have this background of, this group I don't scream, get me out of this machine yeah give him give me the hell out of here I can't handle it um, and I'm sure they've had that happen yeah what could have been quite traumatic, I actually birthed out of it somehow I felt maybe that's too wild but um I would say birth into it yeah just because I believe people running to get out of things instead of inner finer of things is why I change it yeah all right great thanks Danny thank you as well no I think they said it's working on um in the dojo on the situation and character we're doing the same in my classes down here so interesting other side of the world and doing the same thing yeah thank you yeah that yeah thank you people who are approaching the end so anything to say go for it go for it said say this is Justin what uh Danny reminds me of is, of the last time I had to sit in a dentist chair and uh you know making and allowing more room for myself helped me achieve a level of comfort I didn't have when I first sat down but, moreover I, really find how as especially some of the earlier speakers tonight like Steve was laying out his process of, easy and subtle and open it, helps us achieve a achieve a, listening and sensing and trusting place where we don't we don't have to know we don't have to know because if we're listening that information will come to us and don't let the not knowing of something stop you from sensing feeling because that information and the stories there want wanted to share themselves with you yeah uh you're at a level like if we were the plant for example we don't have to know that we need iron or calcium or something it's just there for, us natural so anyways don't let the not knowing stop you from experiencing sense of trust and Trust Factor we've been funning around like with uh Amy's wanted to be stronger uh it's okay to sort of I don't know dictate that the right word uh to say hey I'd like to be stronger now let the process start Center to Circle and circle the center, to Circle and circle the center or plant to nutrients and nutrients feeding the plant uh so to be clear on what you're working on can't hurt you know yeah whatever God whatever I'm not sure what's going to happen there, uh so to be a, little a little I tried to stress that I think a little bit tonight of, uh there are two main pieces here uh character and situation, characters sort of be clear as to which one you're working don't, smudge them too much be clear okay, and if you practicing bouncing back and forth in a little faster form be clear which one you're working that minute and when you're changing now let's work this one be clear you're talking about this one so this will be, clear with yourself as to what you're doing don't be all over the place kind of thing yeah Basics basic, you know uh, right Amy in the gym we're gonna focus on bicep we focus on bicep right the only focus on that muscle yes my set right not your cash around we're doing this, let's work this simple, old, school barbell gym anyway people I think good enough you got nothing me and Brad are out of here heading towards catch's kitchen see you next week thank you Sensei thank you very much good session thanks everybody questions

okay hey okay ah before we get into this uh and she teaches you want to mention uh, quickly how good you were at last week's conference where you were who was there, yeah well thank you for that Sensei yeah I had the opportunity to speak at Drake University, and um and um uh in Des Moines Iowa of all places and during that time the theme was, about creativity and I had really dialogued a lot with uh Sensei about creativity he gave me some great points that I shared with both faculty The deans of various departments and the philosophy department and uh it was it was very well received and just a point on that to say that the thing that Sensei mentioned that I thought was so important was not about tips about creativity but the experience of creativity so in the experience of creativity you know really connecting with that blank canvas aspect you know in our language in sensei's language you know it's easy the eye and open and settle now even though I wouldn't use those phrases without vetting them with the with the people first and you know explaining that a little bit I did talk about centering and the importance of that connecting with, this so that we, we understand the, the value of, settling and having that space beginning even with space so that was it was very well received very positive and well received by the community there yay good, good, uh before you move along in tonight's thing uh what we do last week uh questions comments insights something remind me what we did last week and everyone else jumping no one remembers I'm the only one has no memory of anything of course my good excuse is I was gone so yes, the teacher was according to University groups yes, yeah Bob Steve here uh we're talking about Circle Center Harmony and um, I guess you know the, main theme was that, as, the situation changes the character is impacted and as the characters impacted the situation is impacted there's this, Dynamic that goes on between them and there's this harmony or at least a, desire for Harmony and uh so that I think that was really the main thing yeah the desire it's not I gotta desire this unnecessarily it's within those two forces uh there is inherent in them uh within that a desire to harmonize balance whatever, to dance together whatever, yeah, so character situation, to yeah so again if we settle and open enough, and play with one and then the other and the other and back to this one it should, get clear and clearer for you as you spend some time with it yeah uh okay thank you somebody anything on the last week that turns you on or confuse you or uh center circle, Center Sensei this is Justin I would say that uh one thing that really has been coming up more and more this week especially for me has been the, trust Factor that's involved in the sense that we don't have to, know a whole lot about what's going on going on but if we're listening and we're settled open into a more of a listening space and just trusting the process the situation will inform us and our sense of character will inform us as well about what is possible here on levels that we won't always know and the not knowing shouldn't stop us from settling opening into this listening participating space so there's a trust Factor I'd like to once you do a couple of few basic patterns Bobby to Robert de Nado one by two by three by Bad Day fair day good day whatever, once you do a few of those uh then I don't know how much you need the word trust to know that whatever level you're at the next level is going to be a finer vibrational Dimension producing either if you're highlighting character a finer level of character or a better sense of the situation and the character in the situation, supporting the character that, relationship there so, yeah trust uh and at first I didn't have a lot of knowledge so I bumped in this I can't remember exactly but I remember, exactly but I remember if I make this next move whatever it was wherever I was at the time I don't know if I'm still going to be alive, this strong feeling uh but I trusted well so far my quote meditation seemed to be okay I'll just go for it or move into the next whatever you want to call that but I didn't know and there was that sense of a possible death now I say oh yeah it was the death of a Bobby so he could become a Robert or a death of this level of situation so the finer of that situation could show but at the time I didn't know I just got seen my way through so sort of my history I didn't have anybody holding my hand leading me laying out these beautiful diagrams okay uh so a lot of my work was on my own okay and so yeah in that case having faith Trust try it out uh yeah, yeah if you're too chicken I'm not sure how far you, would get in doing this or any process if you're I don't want to try that I'm not sure whatever uh I, thought it's gonna get very far with anything okay so whatever word you want to use trust sure yeah, but it does get easier with more and more practice and the continuation of things that the finer more encompassing they are it, gets much easier yeah, yeah somebody anything from period from last week, Insight question problem s okay if not if so pleasantly quiet okay our write-up for tonight was uh, reactions to the underworld there we go thank you save me from having a lift this, workbook, okay so reactions underworld but then I, was thinking about it and I thought well let's, play a bit with there and but let's do the, uh the other direction of it so to speak uh so that's what I got push and pull and that's why I have downward air arrows and upward air arrows uh what I'd like that fun around with now it's going to seem very easy so my quote Advanced people don't uh dismiss it oh yeah I know that I, don't care if you know it what, I want to play with is starting very simply with Bobby body or Robert body present okay you know so again the experience I it's like I know you all know you have a body and you have a name for the body I'm Robert you're whatever you are okay yeah that's nice but right now I want to feel my presence body okay, all right all right now the game I'd like to play is let's start off not knowing a bunch of stuff okay let's start off as if we're what to call them the heavier humans those people you associate with that you have pity on anyway let's start off at that that's fairly, basic really basic it's like I don't know anything about energy stuff or whatever okay now in this energy is moving upwards okay I don't care about the, uh situational thing I just want to work on this main Center the plant let's say the plant okay energies are starting to move up through the plant okay now as a human being what's your first sense of energies coming to and through the system these arrows should really be going through him and through him okay so energies are beginning to the beginnings of flowing through the system, there you are now with you individually a vague a vague feeling of these energies or a sense feeling of these energies they what would you attribute that to what would you say for example I'll give you my example right now it's a little faintant of nervousness maybe, a little potential quiver in my knees okay I'm just sitting here but, there's this vague sense of nervousness and a little more body feeling a little quiver in my knees okay so let's say that's one of my very early pickups on the energies from under starting to come up through the character plant okay somebody what's yours I want to hear a variety, at this very early level feeling, here comes some Energies and I feel a sense of tightness in my stomach and chest a little bit okay, so we'd imagine the pressure means pressure here that pressure it could be I feel pressure from the world I feel pressure, from the world I feel pressure in my head or I feel pressured here so for me clarity yes physically agitating I'm physically agitated and, that it produces a this agitation results in a tightening of my abdomen and my chest a little bit so if you're just sitting there and suddenly you'll notice things are getting a little tight okay, okay now, because, you don't know anything about what's going on energy wise what would you think is happening for example in my case was I nervous I might look around to see what I'm nervous about and I could find something I got tacha in the kitchen she makes me nervous I get you guys out there you make me nervous I got the world out there makes me nervous texts are coming up that really makes me nervous okay do I could run around and find something but, I just want to stay with the character okay you got the game somebody uh Sensei Bob here yeah pressure in the neck and the back of my head and I feel like I'm stiffening against what I think has changed it's coming but I don't know what the change is so I'm kind of starting to kind of stiffen and resist it a little bit okay so something's moving through in Bob's case this starts to happen okay all right hydrate so you can see this starts to happen and he's noticing that he would reject that fight it I, don't want this to happen you know I gotta go get my neck massage or something where would you go with that Bob just from there would you go get your neck massage where would you go with that yeah I'd call my chiropractor and say hey yeah I got a stiff neck can you help me okay you'd have to use mine by the way just as an example but if that's what you do cool okay, somebody Here Comes softly through I feel like shock in my in my nervous system, it's detailed that that's too big that's too big for me keep it simple for me the beginning of the feeling before you get the totality of your nervous system can you keep it even smaller you're sure fear okay, um but also excitement though okay so some activity that we could misinterpret is fear and other people could misinterpret as, excitement or the both like fearful of jumping out of the plane in my parachute but I'm excited about it or something so, yeah okay so apparently a couple of things could uh that happen okay fine cool thank you somebody that's very early beginnings Steve have you said anything yet come on I need help yeah, my butt is, very uncomfortable sitting on the chair uh it's, I'm, just getting kind of restless here okay and my body is a little achy um uh probably I would want to move somewhere else I would want to get away from this yeah so if we had started with uh Steve sit quietly suddenly he's having a problem he can't sit quietly okay, okay is there any story you would make up about that at that level any story you'd make up about why you're uncomfortable or what's happening to your butt or something uh, just, be a general restlessness here uh, um, sense of uh discontent about something I'm, sure I, would have a story about why I'd be pissed off about, why I'd be pissed off about something or other you know the world or whatever would be pissing me off and I'm Restless I don't like how things are so I, like that so in our restlessness because we're not clear really on how things work we have to make up a story is that okay following you here yeah, that's, accurate Bob has to make up a story that he needs medical attention somebody working on his neck uh my fearfulness I'd have to find something that why I should feel fearfulness I can come up with a bunch of things again right the wife in the kitchen the taxes coming up uh okay I just want to point out how see I want you to feel what's sort of normal people feel and what they do the stories they make up and the amount of whatever time money energy they put into the stories when I'm sort of inferring I'm not sure how much truth there is to the stories at this stage of the game the truth is there are some energies flowing up flowing up the stories you make up may not have anything to do with it it's your reaction stories could we call that maybe like that reaction stories okay if you're following my, practice plan here somebody Tisha you got anything for us um actually nothing that specific um when I'm feeling the when I'm feeling the energies come up it I guess the first thing I notice is that it's not normal it's, it's Unique from my normal something different is happening to me right now sitting here yeah okay how different, in what Manner different well specifically as I'm doing the doing the practice with you right now I'm just feeling like a little bit of like extra warmth along my spine so that's, just like the first okay it's not it's not my normal you know every, part of the day and for fun playing along with this game that I'm setting up what stories might you get into because of that occurrence in this centered character plant yeah it's I'd probably say oh I must be resisting because you usually if there's heat there's some blockage in the in a system to cause that friction so you know too much already simple, I don't even know if people know that oh he is because I'm congesting things and whatever it's simple, you're a dummy from the street you're Mr arm you don't know I want to stay at that level a bit sure yeah okay I sort of want you to understand in the sense when people say gee I sit down and I get nervous that you kind of go aha kind of thing do you say gee what are you nervous about now you're going to go into their stories maybe, they have a good story I'm nervous because I don't have the money for damn taxes oh okay whatever but we're talking about just this unit here the, the story I'm telling myself is something's wrong okay something's wrong and again in Storyland we can make up all kinds of sure am I am I am I getting sick do I have covid yeah that's what I was thinking yeah, I wasn't thinking covet but you know I'm sick something's wrong yeah not terribly sick but you know this is just the beginning like the beginning of a cold or flu or something like that okay, okay you all have a sense of the game I'd like to hear from somebody else other than my quote regulars hello out there in the world playing the game hi Sensei, it's Gina, hi Gina hi Gina okay you're sitting there and for one reason the upflow of energy wants its turn here it comes if I was trying to if I was like trying to learn how to meditate I'd go this I'm doing something wrong this is wrong this is not it and I'd probably all right how do you know that you haven't told us what you're feeling great it doesn't you know I feel really thick kind of like Steve my butt hurts sitting here and it's like so did she say oh you're not used to feeling my body okay and if I was doing something you know if it was like stage right or something I'd want to go have a glass of wine or do drugs or something to shift it well I'll join you on the wine part but yes but that that's another escape again yeah you can go into the stories or go into the booze or go into whatever continuation of the story yeah okay again I want we've touched on this subject before about the early Touch of energy but I thought just sitting here ah and suddenly something starts to happen, okay, and it's not because the situation has changed I don't care about that right now it's just this, body character sitting, for whatever reason the upward flow of Energies, but I shall somebody else well we moved along here somebody else New Zealand Chris you playing this game yeah yes it's a hell with you sorry there you are, you playing this game are you sitting no sit on the damn Chair Talk from there tell the team right so you decided to sit and just easy for a bit just, sit suddenly, after whatever some minutes or whatever here comes the energies softly early through the system what is your feeling of that monsters okay wait you said probably screw you Chris screw you no probably I want an experience it's a it's a, connecting a reaching down so but my immediate direction would say I'm calming but it's actually, there's something coming up and there's, something coming up and there's something coming down so there's a note yeah, so it's so it's so now in this show right now we're just working on the uh scratch out the coming down just highlight to coming up for me so it's a growth filling of growth so a growing okay but what was the negative you don't know anything about energies help me grow and like that you don't know anything but here come the energies what's your feeling at that level what's your experience at that level well I wouldn't say nervous and alert there's a um right nervous okay nervous a little scared there's something different something's changed yeah it's an idiot that's scary if you were home alone you'd probably double check you locked the doors the doors yeah that's funny, you should say it because you're home alone right now and you're getting scared yeah I'm in a different house so yeah the house with the ghosts in it yeah, I know that funny you should say that so yeah the little the little bumps the little changes of energy are certainly a little, uh noticeable subtle things a different noise and you're like Yeah I wanted to catch get you guys about this level where they're very early they settle uh and, yet that you have the ability of feeling then, feel how they touch you some people tighten some people vibrate some people you know you know get scared whatever, and also I added on and what storyline could you get into very easy they may have nothing to do with what's going on but that's where what I could say we all as humans might tend to go so, so he would lock the doors and maybe turn on an extra light or two okay there's a lot of very short baseball bats sitting around the place so I'm not too sure what kind of a neighborhood I'm in thank you he's establishing a reason for what's going on which Serta is, very much that's beautiful what people do with a lot of these first things they make up stories the doctors must get scads of patients who are in a certain way something but they're making up stories and the doctor can't find anything and that same person comes back every week and the doctor gives them a title of what uh hypochondriac was that what yeah, because it keeps feeling affected by something they keep going into the doctor, can't find anything so a lot of but I'm saying all of it but probably a high percentage of that is this that we're playing with okay they do feel unsure or scared or shaky or whatever well I gotta do something with that and here comes the stories yeah and God forbid they're watching soap operas on the hospital thing because they got all kinds of information now about illnesses doctor I think I've got okay, I saw it on TV and I had the strange feeling yes okay anyway I'm gonna get carried away here ah Okay so now we being more advanced know that this energy coming up no, big situational deals just you and the energy, okay what would you do with that for example I might say oh something more is trying to come into play, so it catches my attention Basics would be what settle open you'd have to settle too deep because it's already kind of there and we're surmising a little bit strong quick settle open with the sense that oh it's Just Energy and sometimes I play word games with I say oh sorry I didn't know you were here give me a second to open up to invite you more fully here I sometimes play quick little word games like, that you know you know uh sorry I, know you rang the doorbell but I didn't hear it I apologize come on in, this stuff okay welcoming so once we get the signal that something's coming through just as a character settle open let more of the energy come through and now it starts the say the up and down balancing beat okay energies come in settle back down come in again settle back down we could use breathing as a reference okay exhaling inhaling whatever and they're mixing, my word mixing uh a better character we surmise that's our pattern okay, okay so catching an early signal being more adapt adept debt what are the papers at this okay uh then you can instead of going into stories which often are just total wasted time money energy we just hang out with the Here and Now of it all right let's see what else uh somebody else says you're following this what, else would you add to this I, say oh I apologize I invite them in I know they're mixing my word mixing a fuller one okay Fuller one Bob you want to add something right, right here to this one well since the, fact that you didn't try to apply your previous knowledge and so yeah I know what that is by sticking to the experience you're starting from an experiential base rather than an awareness space okay very good very good so I think I mentioned when we started the advanced people would say ah we've done this before I understand this I know this know this what he said was right what I was trying to say to really experience but this is kindergarten well if you don't experience a kindergarten how do you how are you going to experience in high school or at the University you have no practice okay so a fuller experience hanging out with just the first sense of experiencing something that's very subtle but just the practice of feeling experiencing that is great practice don't Slough it off I know that yes I understand that's energy and it does this yeah that's all that's tough right it's another discussion right now we're here with this stuff here with this stuff thank you Mom that's about what I needed right there somebody else want to jump in on where we're going here the possibilities here Sensei this is Justin if when we've achieved a more settled and open can we not ask the energies for its story ask for more clarification ask them to rephrase or describe elaborate on what's going on the floor sense by asking those holy crap for checking good uh yeah sometimes it's kind of a cop-out I'll let you in once I know what you're going to do that's kind of a cop-out it's like the eye that wants to know is not the, next level of I or Robert or not though or whatever uh that is experiencing that and in that nose there is knowing in the experience sometimes a cop-out is I, gotta know about it before I allow myself to get into it and let it happen to me once in the workshop some guy came up this excellent week-long Workshop what are we going to do this week what am I going to get out of this week and I may not be saying it will uh but it was like in a certain way I don't know but do what we do and we'll see what happens kind of thing but he was adamant he wasn't going to sign up for this class or enter the meeting room I'm telling you exactly what was going to happen you're following me what am I, don't know what to do with a guy like that screw him I don't know if that was a good example story but there I am uh where are we where are we experience, experience okay so noting those things very early so you can start your process oh you, hear the doorbell earlier okay I don't wait for the, delivery guy when he's bringing food uh to walk up and pound on the door uh I pick him up when he pulls the car into the driveway right there and I see the headlights then I'm up there and with the money and waiting for them uh so earlier is better I'm trying to say dumb example sorry So within our own system if you pick it up earlier then later with more practice we get faster at oh go ahead and mix and what's it not a question what they're trying to do but uh as it mixes what seems to be happening in my system you gained calmer you're getting stronger you're getting wiser what seems to be happening in your system, did I say that right let me let me check with Brad you're okay with that Brad Brad's okay with that yeah somebody other than the same old faces that talk every week somebody uh always let your Chris from New Zealand again she um I was like if you had your turn I don't know if we should give you a second one but go ahead I'm sorry the camera's stuck on we better go the um they almost have that curiosity that very loose curiosity of experience and not have an expectation or want a result just sit in that moment of um just what's gonna out you're just gonna be and let go of those human qualities I know from an Aikido point of view there's always that I want a result yeah instead of trying to have an experience and a result yeah be uh by you know a product of an experience yeah you're on the right track there I, might say it in the tear different me uh, so it starts to happen oh there's something happening uh and there's yes a bit of curiosity gee I wonder who it's going to mix let's say in this case who it's going to mix what it's trying to say what it's trying to give me okay what nutrient it's trying to give me what quality it's trying to give me all of those things the men shows there yeah so there's a curiosity if there's no curiosity I don't know if somebody would inquire there's no curiosity about it, okay, but not to hang on to their curiosity not to make a story but just to like yeah it's interesting and go on the trip or curiosity and open something, yeah I had a question though uh, back to a simpler format those who are in medical so we got uh, Justin uh foreign on Eden's here doesn't seem to be no one oh wow what, I was going to add well I'll ask is keeping it simple a patient comes in and they're in essence saying when I sit still for a moment no, no, that happens, did I say that all right Justin okay you must have had some of those where, they sort of mentioned everything's okay until I, sit for a moment or something like, that then suddenly all this stuff happens Susan you want to jump in on that did you, don't know if I worded it well but you get to drift jump in can she hear me is she way back in the mountains again hey sensei did you hear my question I did I did okay, um I can't think of any off the top that um, come to me without um but what I wanted to say is that I'm I appreciated from the early practice that we did we did that it's almost that the more you worry about the energies in a certain way the more you call them up and so I'm appreciating how you know people who don't know how to deal with it how enormous their consternation might become oh hold it there that's a good point that's a good point something we should file away uh let's see so there's energy starting to flow up through and you begin to worry about them you say yeah what's this right they may increase trying to clarify the finer reality of them yeah that's cool that you caught that I've experienced that working with people where uh you know the first flows of energy for some people are very negative they, hear negative things like you can't do anything right and then have them settle and open if I remember what I used to do back when uh excellent days settle and open now what is it saying and it'd be still negative and not as horrible yeah and we continue in another level and I think I used to do a pipeline now you've got a, three inch pipeline more is coming through what's it saying now okay and usually by the third unless they're very negative uh it starts to change where it becomes almost friendly okay either at three or three or four for normal, folks okay uh says to become friendly now some people right there uh because it was sort of a monster at first you can't do anything right, and the voice sounds like your mother or your father's or whoever it is uh, that when it starts to say hey I'm here to help you uh a lot of people have a distrust right there no it's trying to con me and if I open to it it's going to get me kind of thing all right so I've had experience with that more than once and you were bringing that up cool, good call good continue con uh you never get a sense of somebody sitting there as a patient in front of you, where they begin to talk about these early energy moves of what they're feeling and why they're visiting you medical person and you kind of spot almost from the get-go let's say that ah they don't know what energy is oh it's just their own stuff oh no yeah I do when I see them you know both looking, sort of there must be something wrong um is often the, um concern or there must be something that the doctors don't know about that I have um you know I get people that just look all over the place for what it might be yeah and the stories come fast and easy huh yes and they're become quite convoluted, yeah once you get into the stories that yeah it can really spin yeah quite convoluted yeah and how to dialogue with them when they're in there convoluting because as soon as you say well what about right they'll say no it's left you say well what about left they'll say no it's right you say what about left and right, you say what about left and right they'll say no it's something else yes it's caught up in that in their trap and they can play games with you oh and on and on yes could potentially get endless you know that right it's endless, you know that right it's endless you've been through to that yes uh is that it from you yeah um, you know the folks who are able to just calm open a little bit um sometimes it doesn't take very much for the energy to be more friendly ah it used to be more okay so what are you saying once they stop being tight and if they will in fact settle and open a bit yes you ask them to straighten up or breathe or move their hands even yep uh or some people doesn't take much before continue yeah before it's okay and they appreciate those are those are those energies are okay that feels good all right uh Judson I'm sure you've got an example here, basically I'm asking somebody sits down and says you know when I sit quiet for a moment, it's very simple right at that level I'm sure you had patience I would think talk to me we, do so there's a lot that goes on under a the umbrella holistic but this aspect of, what we would commonly call mind or mind feelings stress plays a big part in, what they experience and every day somebody's sitting down with some level of what we would call anxiety or Panic or agitation and, they, they almost across the board seem to be living through their day-to-day with such a limited capacity that when they stop and they're still for a moment they almost freak out because they they're so busy that they're not listening they're not sensing feeling that's so off their radar that when they settle for a moment and immediately they're, exposed to this the energies they get really agitated and they don't realize oh my I'm only available for this and the energies are requiring me to be that yeah and you can run every test like Susan said a lab work Imaging and it really is just ABC and they have a hard time believing that a lot of them that there must be something wrong no it could just be anxiety but energy really it's not here to bother you there's something going on there it may be foreign when they have when they've reached the level of it anxiety which they think of as mental as mental than to say okay in a certain way you're saying not really subtle open let's feel the body uh that there's that what are you talking about my I'm I got anxiety what are you doing down here doing this kind of thing so um, that by experience if we give ourselves the chance to take a deep breath even if it's incremental there's some space that's created and they do feel um a little bit better something shifting even if it's less horrible that's good we're moving in the direction of good it's not from horrible it's awesome yeah but you know Bobby to Robert Robert's not fantastic but he's a lot better than Bobby it's a small let's say small thing a fair Day to a good day sounds big time but really it's small move, you know a fair Day to a great day or whatever or honey I had the greatest day in my life now that's a big jump can happen uh but the small increments as practice, practice, sort of I started starting a sense of dimensionality [Music], once you get the flavor of that and how it works then the advanced people I want to go for more original enough of this development Bobby Robert Nado whatever no, more original right, there with what you got so I set this up as a b the character and the situation, and character a certain level of balance Harmony whatever there Bobby level Bobby can't pull it off Robert could be but not generally let's say Robert and not do it should be enough if he's doing this process of Center Circle Center kind of thing uh then I call that one if he's got a good one he's in alignment with more original it continues inner but it's not it's not Nado to Mr Nado to Sensei to Shihan to a certain point where enough of that okay now I know some people jumped the gun and said well enough of that I'm going for this great self of number two one two and like yeah, that's an idea, Here and Now experience and don't be afraid of the small experiences practice okay, but people are too fast in the mind they don't want to do this they wanna I know it I know and maybe they got a little scope here they can see finer or is it an actual experience in the fineness of things actually so, tricky, with people at that point anyway okay now uh before okay Before Time Goes By too much uh so we did a little game with the, push where the energy for whatever reason is saying to the plant character be better you know you can be better and the character begins to feel that and says yeah hey honey I wanna I think I wanna lose more weight or I think I want to put on some muscle or I think I want to make more money or something he gets enough of the character we're starting to want to move out in, expand the situation, character, situation so don't again don't know if I worded it well but that where, am I going okay so you have energies that highlight the character, and I'm just trying to make those distinct okay staying with characters still but the opposite side of the coin if there's a push there's a pull so let's call this a push boom and push-up okay trying to make the plant a better healthier whatever boom plant the other side of the coin is its reverse Direction the pull the pull that's what the light green line is supposed to infer again should be going through the body as opposed to out there someplace but good enough right now playing the game again come on sit settle easy you don't know nothing right you're just sitting there you're a human being, sitting there you can feel yourself as human beings feel yourself now the first hint of a pull in only pulling down she was talking about the physical we're not talking about the situation, talking about you by yourself right now the character the first sense of a pull in give you an example Bob your first example, and congestion in my nose and uh nasal passages and everything if I was going to make a story up here I'd say geez I'm getting like a cold or I'm getting sick or something okay so congestion what was the one you told me this afternoon when I asked you to run this uh I think of the body um getting narrow uh compression a compression like, my spine was getting compressed down you know like somebody was pushing on the top of my head that kind of feeling okay so tonight's example and again you have many examples it's a variety of examples and within yourself you're going to have different examples so today you can see the whole body start to whatever you said condensing congested the second goal rights is all getting congested in the nose okay anyway easy that was that was an example or two in your case sitting in settling and suddenly there's a Down a pool there's a pull going on easy is going on okay no I'll ask you to be it's a little bit more sensitive than the norm to pick up that pulling sensation how you physically first begin to feel it keep it simple keep it in the early stages I feel the heaviness in my legs Maybe yeah she as the pull would happen the heaviness in the legs would probably infer I, can't pick my legs up to go for a walk or a hike or a run or something like that just adding to it yeah okay so heaviness, okay so maybe people that feel like they're a blob, what's a normal Human Social words there for that feeling blob is not the best one come on Couch Potato sluggish Couch Potato okay, uh maybe some examples people give me some examples, who are sitting there but it's okay it's okay and suddenly seemingly out of nowhere starts to be this thing happening my breathing change changing the bread but shortened almost rougher yeah great good reading of yeah get shallower shorter yeah, could somebody I get a pressure in my sinuses okay, so it's like um again it's like a compression it's like somebody squeezing my sinuses okay you and Noah tonight belong to the same Club somebody normal day suddenly seemingly out of nowhere there's this feeling what do you think I need examples different examples Bob I feel a tightness in my gut okay here I'm wondering asking a questionnaire we had tightness in the gut on the energies coming up but you're saying on the end there's tightness in the gut Yeah a different direction might I come is that a Jewish thing, only get tension this way and you guys get tension that way go ahead I'm sorry I cut you out they're stupid me more in the butt being pushed you know and I'd be antsy but here is more almost like um, I might feel a little anxiety a different quality to it um not a Restless thing um uh just um in the past I probably would have wanted to eat um but I'm unsettled in the tummy so to speak following the Jewish line is this where they say meh, no this is not mad this is beyond man oh beyond that oh yeah that'd be spilkus anyway uh could, you all give me uh instead of just physical on this one a search sort of an attitude also an attitude change on the on the dumb thing here you should say I have one this is amen go aiming mine is um it's a sense of curiosity I feel when I if it's just a normal day and, oh I get that, pull down now I'm just say pull down tell me what you felt or, your attitude sense of things on the pole don't sell yeah the pull down okay, we're starting as normal dumb people here, right so let's keep it simpler it feels like I'm in the center of the drain and I'm drawn into the wharf The Wharf I guess I like that one because when I was funning around getting ready for this that was when it showed up for, me definitely true so very good but again that's ours there's our many, I'm not saying yo people you must experience this I give you a couple for example okay, so it could be yeah great it doesn't feel like it's a negative at all neither Direction really feels like a negative it just feels like oh I'm curious about this what's this okay, let's see if we can fit her in so then that movement didn't negate your, thinking sense of things no you're okay with the movement you're, okay with the movement you're going oh okay what is this she might I want to explore it yeah, yes, we got that my patient is really okay with down energies okay so when they begin to happen she has no fear or gets negative about them that doesn't occur in her system and she goes oh what's up today where is it going what level am I going to hit and then who will I be okay by the way that's what those lies rep represent uh going down to a to a different level hey inferring easy settle open in first dimensionality finer dimension dimensionality finer dimension and that you're standing on a finer floor or a floor that has a, bigger pool of energies there so we'll get a re-beat so down, down and eventually boom and from the boom bang kind of thing so am I getting too far ahead of anybody here for the Simplicity uh so okay we'll file that away some people are so okay with the down, would you say during the covet time that we talked a lot about downtime and that, you were okay with the sense of down and you could sit with it and fun with it was great it was great yeah okay yeah it was like before everything I mean there was a sense of anxiety but it was a lot of it was like oh I like that I like down she's, one of those type yes okay yeah anyway to recognize that either the attitude give me an example of an attitude, okay one for me would be would be as this is happening it's an unsurety I'm sure yeah I'm not even sure what to think about right now okay or If This Were happening when I'm prepping for a show it would be unsure about what tell I should try to lay out or unsure about should I lay it out that way something like that so unsure for me is part of the what's that what's the word there Attitude Change not just physical okay we'll note it in the physical okay because I would tend to feel skinnier yeah okay more incapable now is this an attitude now a little more incapable honey let's go to the gym no uh not, not today I'm in this and I'm incapable yeah, so that'd be the story that I would make up well no I can't as you get more versed in this then we know the tricks of being bang and we can if you so want to but it's possible yeah, yeah I gave you a few examples you talk to me the not just a physical sense here through for like Words attitudinal change go I got one Sensei um Sean here I feel like sometimes uh I can be hopelessly lost in thought and then I'll catch myself for a moment of, uh Reckoning comes I don't know something happened boom and there I am and I get miffed irked I get uh angry at myself for her being so lost um and on a better day or okay again we're just keeping it very simple yep want to go on to a better day I don't know if I want to go there but give it a shot but I'd be like okay if I hang out with it for a bit and realize how much grief I'm giving myself then I can settle down a little bit and feel like you could afford to be a little more gentle with yourself and you know like my thing is there you go again Sean all buddy you know it's sort of like a mantra I, wonder if in this case people you, guys play and research it if getting caught up in this mind drift or yeah, and realizing you've been in this mind driven getting nowhere accomplishing nothing kind of thing uh that you got ah what am I doing and right away there this starts and as soon as this starts you said something semi-positive right there in the early stages of oh first you want to get angry at yourself yeah okay but that's that is being more gentle with myself like there you go enjoy yourself a little more humorous ironic yeah so again I'm pretty good at some of the so I wouldn't hang out with angry at myself very long but for a quick moment to notice it I wouldn't hang out laughing about the humor of it all for ages I want to keep moving with this keep going on with this so I experienced those things but I don't stop there I don't stop at that angry station for long hopefully or the happy station for long I was like yeah that's cool at this level and continuing what's the Fuller of this that's happening kind of thing what's the Fuller understanding of what's going on yeah you've been you've been a great guide that way especially in the last two weeks I, think another word for grape guide is pain in the ass yes he agrees okay [Laughter] oh before I forget how many do we have on right now uh 27, okay before I forget no next week okay, I'm gonna try twice a month okay now digest this feel this the first and third Fridays the first and third Friday every month if we continue and continue okay first and third so in May the first Friday yes the third Friday yes okay yeah did you feel that it's memorized now so that would be Friday the first Friday is May 5th in California, sixth in New Zealand the third Friday is May 19th in California the 20th in New Zealand bro well Friday is May 5th third Friday is May 19th May 19th and for us non-forners first and third okay another reminder San Francisco Aikido people the Sunday the 30th San Francisco Dojo will do a shot what time oh I think they know one o'clock I think yeah and what donations are welcomed I made a joke to the my Engineers that my, Starbucks bill is, adding up they're going to not give me service here so here so yes we have the uh There's the link for uh donations so there you go empty your wallet into the into the Coffer there yes please do it it's uh it's important to uh in supporting, not only this work but sensei's work and, uh so be as generous as you can thank you thank you uh so running, over here anything about recognizing whether it's a down Pull and again you, know the basics down tool to a certain level you have to catch that level just feel it something there and from that level Boom the inflations it's almost like a exhale to a certain point and then an inhale I call it Slurpee sometimes or a mix um enhances the character of Bobby going down can around and be a Robert okay or a 10 pounder funning around can be a 20 pounder okay so I mentioned to uh okay Oakland Amy said I want to get stronger dad said the sense a little bit deeper into this a little bit deeper it a, a better floor that better floor has more a pool of energy of strength okay, and cap it Slurpee it mix it and something should begin to happen if you swim around I just felt her depth wasn't quite enough for what she wanted okay blah right Amy you've been funning around of course when you get results and you'd say wow I know yes working on it okay, so we're, okay on down floor more available let's do a quickie quick Aikido type thing okay uh let's say yes Brad I need you boy okay when I turn around I'm gonna do slow motion okay uh forget this is the situation I'm not worried about that right now character boom down deeper okay hits a certain floor from that floor more fully through the body okay, that was what I just said right lady get to do very fast not as an idea well it works oh yes I understand be there been good okay, as an actual even the actual gets very fast boom deeper open Slurpee Fuller and Fuller, and Fuller okay when you get a guy like uh this style, when they when they do something and then come up from their shoulder it's like no they just have a little extra shoulder energy yeah but not good enough or good I, want everything Fuller so that's uh a simple Aikido technique that can really highlight that sort of like do it now and then okay thank you okay oh where are we where are we uh, so we've got bush okay yeah so when you're getting pushed you realize you're being pushed quick settling don't worry about going deeper, it's already there pushy okay but do a do a quick you know stop so to speak, being open allowing to push Energies to come in and add to the character mix up a better character, okay, so, the pull down to a certain level open and the mix starts with that newer energy that's the time the up the up just position yourself open welcome it oh sorry I didn't hear that first doorbell thank you for being here, going to be interesting to see what quality you are I just continue I don't recover what quality are you I'm interfering with, the mix okay let me think about the mix oh yeah I'm gonna be handsome and socially acceptable don't me here boom breathe it feel it have an experience, the experiencer will have knowledge but if you try to get knowledge about an experience that haven't been experienced we're getting into land can't say it any better but I'll just keep saying it okay, how many students try to show them something physically unimately and they say oh yes since I understand but when they say that I'm just I'm there with them I feel no body changed nothing changes in their energy but they understand and they keep doing it they don't change this part of things critical, critical okay so yes so yes there's a place for understanding that a map is my presentation of that part of it, but then you have to sit and feel and have the ability of playing these games, okay so yes it's very useful look at the sitting man oh that's right I understand let's do it sitting so easy to see easy to read about it but someplace along the line you've gotta do it and play with it and play with it for a while and then more fully being it okay yeah if we go back to patients for just a second on what you said on pit clients patients mere mortals if you will the, idea often takes people to not understanding but misunderstanding and because something's so uncomfortable at that first level and they misunderstand they are reluctant to open and welcome what's deeper and more available for them there so they do brace themselves and they sort of tell these stars and pocket out because they've established it as a monster I make jokes about this all the time uh I'm asking people to stick their bare bottom over the edge of the rowboat in a crocodile infected Lake they're monsters so we have to in some cases very easily present they look like Monsters they feel like Monsters they sound like Monsters but just play it a little bit here, what if they're not can you settle an open a bit just, try it out a little bit, okay stick your toe in the water not your whole butt okay just a little bit easy there's a little more room here easy and even right there you may notice ah that that's already a change and you could ask them right, there because you feel the change right you're a pro you feel the change you see the change you say what about there now they may not yet be experiencing it so they might may not yet said yeah I don't know or, no change but you, know it's coming you go okay one more whatever, so we have to gently so far anyway take them into this because they've created this again this bad PR that underworld energies has that's the devil's land and it's horrible under there looks that's what it first looks like so how to introduce people that have a innate fear I do a class and I ask the people just sort of settle bend their knees a little bit no don't crawl around the ground just bend the knees just be more present with the ground just sort of open just a little bit right there you know out of every good sized class it'll always be a couple are standing there with stiff legs looking at me ain't no way they're going to bend their knees, you say oh this poor person they're really uh Bob you talked about uh, being uptight on your, G's up yes people are so really that way and you say bend your knee no not me man because it infers to them they're settling deeper and, and so you know you, show them a simple thing a little bend your knees here and we'll breathe little stretch we'll move we'll hum whatever and, a couple at first ain't gonna do it they ain't gonna do it that's a real fear I mean we're not asking them to do gymnastics they're saying bend your goddamn knees be more physically present oh when I'm present I start to get so we got to deal with those little people in some form or cut they're either simpler exercises for them or better verbal explanations for them something but you guys are in the field you figure it out you research you play okay oh quick story esslin needs to do this thing I guess we're probably uh talking about settling or something and I have somebody a guy lay down and eight or so people whoever could fit around them we would touch this person with their hands not heavy pressure just touch with a sense of subtle easy stay at all inhibit and there'll be people touching it his shoulders his back his hips his knees okay some people soon they did that the person go immediately deeper and settle you could you could feel them on my expression pooling out like oh, this is great this is Grand but out of the group there's our always be a couple I think there are many guys don't hold me to that uh who as soon as it started to happen they would come screaming out of there I mean really strong physically their next move would have been to lash out I mean really they, couldn't take any settling and in the added a little no pressure but it'll add a little, they they'd freak out they'd freak out what does that tell us tells us something, enough for tonight nothing next week right back on the first uh Friday of next month thank you thank you thanks Bob thank you

## Flow Through from Sensing World to Normal World, Robert Nadeau, Aikido 8th Dan, 2024-04-19

**Date:** 2024-04-19

time. So, this is the first time that anything like this has come into print. So, we're all pretty excited about it. Um, it was some good uh definitely hard work by the editorial team, but I think we were we're happy with the final result. Of course, it's not exhaustive teachings. It's not everything, but it does lay out some of the core teachings, some of the core uh principles that uh Naido sensei has taught over the course of his amazing career as a transformation meditation teacher and certainly as an Aikido sensei. So, the idea for this having this uh in, what was called a Roku uh which is kind of a record. It's a, it's a it's a term that we use in Zen sometimes and uh but a, record that is brought forward about the teacher and it's often stories but we expanded it. Um the we the, team the editorial team expanded this then to include a really great biography Sensei and also to take the opportunity to at really at, sensei's request and our delight was to look at these core teachings and these fundamental teachings stuff that if you've been a student of Robert Nadau over time. You've heard him say many times, you know, the one by two by three by easy the eye, the eye, you know, all of these uh the in his own way of speaking about the transformation, the Bobby Robert Nado piece as well. So, in that way, um we're excited about the book and we'll let you know more about it. There might even be um you know an in-person book signing at some point that Sensei will attend. Yeah. Autumn just are we still on Phil Autumn just had a chat on the chat thing link you can order if you want to. He's ready. Wonderful. Oh yeah. Thanks Autumn. Thanks, Sensei. Good evening. Hello. Why don't you name the people who are on the committee very more in the future but why don't you, because you talked about this why not say who, well this thing together the one and only uh Bob Noah of course and Richard Moon um Susan Spence Elaine Yodar uh and Lauren Hair of course and myself made a, a team of six and uh We worked um quite well together. I thought, don't you think uh Noah that and uh Moon who are on tonight that we I, think we worked really good as a uh as a team putting together uh the teachings, the compilation of the stories, the chronology, the, the biography, which you did quite a bit of uh Noah yourself. So, thanks. How's that, Sensei? I got I think I got everyone there. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Oh,, I believe we touched some degree on this subject last time we worked together. Uh, but let's start. Okay. What this diagram is wish I wish I could draw in different dimensions. Okay. The black is our basic Okay, that we're in and there's some developmental work that has to be done in this world. That's the Bobby Robert Nado the get more room uh one by two by three by uh stop majoring just in this half aware that you have a body. We should try to get more body presence more experiential from underbeat there. Okay. But that's basic uh so we need a bit of uh of course if some of you have had years of this uh a basic positioning the basic sense of things the basic the basic sense of things the basic experience of things. Okay. No, in the same uh I have to make up some words here. In the same universe, but not on the same level underlying it, could I say is a sensing, if we're going to call this a world, let's call it a sensing world., Okay, there's another world that lines up to and is related to the really butt up close the normal physical world that you can see and touch and whatever. Okay. And in the black world, a normal world that we get different words from the world of sensing green is that green. Yeah. uh we get uh sometimes a flash through or a flow through or a bleed through and whatever other words can make up. Okay. Uh for example, and I'll ask for examples from you all when this has happened to you where you know something you shouldn't have known. Okay, but it was kind of clear to you. We start with that. uh that I'm saying we're getting a flow through, a bleed through, whatever word you want to use that coming from that sensing world. Okay? Again, it's so close that that's trying to show that it's there. Oh, where the hell should we go? I want to shift it over to you people. Uh somebody who knows what I'm talking about, could you start this simple with a flow through or bleed through whatever example? May I who that may Richard, yeah the, one I think is, classic and I think maybe some people know about it and there's an article and there's you know whatever on it uh it was in Stros's book as well but I was my brother was hit by a car was in a coma for a month and um you know people were going aren't you going back and I thought I don't have any idea why I would he's in a coma all of a sudden one night I get this message. Go. And I've got like $180 to my name. And that's how much it costs for a one-way ticket. I don't have any clothes. I'm in shorts and stuff. Some go wake my brother up from this coma. If you want to know more, you can touch in with me. I'll hook you up or it's Stros's book. But anyhow, it just out of nowhere all of a sudden I go there and I wake him up from a coma with an iikido technique. and uh kind of blew everybody's mind and uh but it was just the message that came out of nowhere. How long had he been in a coma at that time?, A month. A month. A month. Yeah. With the doctor saying, "We don't know. He could be there for years, right?" Yeah. That it was absolutely nothing. And I mean, it was it's kind of funny, but you know, I come in and I just uh my mom says, "Well, forget it." You know, I said, "I'm going home." I said, "I'm said, "I'm going home." I said, "I'm coming." It was just whatever it was. It was so strong and I just went in. I walked in. I put like kind of a Nikio type thing on him until he responded. It went in. The nurse went crazy. She goes out. All of a sudden, the doctors come in. It was It was kind of an event, but it was to me it was just Yeah. A month had gone by. Nothing. I'm sitting there, no urge to go whatsoever, a message from or a push by that, you know. I can't Yeah. I can't tell you the, you know, it's kinesthetic. It's for me. I don't get visions. I don't hear voices. It just it was a feeling I had to go and, it kind of takes on words, but it was it was one of the strong ones. Anyhow, one of my favorites. I' I've got a lot of them actually, but that was No, it doesn't have to be what you said though, hearing it or seeing it. Somebody's walking down the street and they decide to take this street instead of that street. But they always take that street, but today they had whatever word you use, just a feeling to take this street. And on that street, the building fell over, killed everybody on the street. Uh, so whatever that feeling was, you don't have to hear words or whatever. It's kind of a let's be free here for a while with how it talks, how it shows. Let's not limit it to you got to hear it. Well, some people are going to pick it up by hearing it. Some people are going to uh in their sensing get a visual on it. Uh, but let's keep it wide open. And we're too new at this to box it in. Okay. You all right with me on that, Richard?, Good. Absolutely. Okay., Uh there's a part Seattle. Do we have any simple examples of a flash through that? This is where people say to you, "How did you know to do that?" or why did you say that? There's no reason to say it that way, but that's the way you said it. And even caught you by surprise when you said it that way. Um, uh and if you're basically intelligent, you realize it just it sort of came out of nowhere and, you don't have any explanation. Now, some of the heavyduty mind awareness types, I'm a smart guy. Oh yes, I was just being smart when that's not what happened. It was a flowth through kind of thing. So don't want to confuse the issue here. Uh but let's be very open to the varieties of possibilities of what can well first show through from that world. Then we have to get into how to be more present in that world. That's where we're heading. And that's that step is part of our journey from the heavier to the finer to the more original. That's part of our journey. So the better we get this whole unit both worlds and we get sort of comfy there next big step which we'll get into eventually I hope should be easier. Okay. Uh, Okay. Uh, somebody a little quicky about a flow through and Noah, let's jump on you. I'm not sure who should come first here. Uh, insurance business. They send them to buildings to check if they if the insurance company should insure these people. So, he's got to scan their safety factors and all of that. You want to throw out a Sorry. Yes. I, went to an assisted living place that a company we were already insuring had recently bought. It was in the uh local Bay Area here. And almost before I went through the front door, I knew this place was not good., And then I was able to get We have to use the right words. You had a sense that this is not a good building or something. Strong sense. Okay. I, I was tempted to just walk out, turn around, but I couldn't do that because I had to collect the information to support, that sense was, correct. Anyway, it was bad enough uh when I got in my car, I called the company on the car phone, but I didn't wait to write my report and I said, "We got we, can't insure this.", Yeah., I said, "If if there's a fire here, there's going to be multiple fatalities." So the company uh refused to insure it and about a year and a half later they had a fire. Six people died. The owners were charged by the local DA with negligent homicide. And I saw a news conference with the local fire marshal. They said, "Yeah, we knew about this, but we couldn't do anything." Which was he was covering his butt there. What's the phrase? Saving your ass or covering your covering your ass. Yeah. But it was just an instantaneous sensing that then I was able to collect the information that told me I was correct. But the sensing came first. Yeah. Uh so what we're realizing with Noah is in that business. See, we each have uh at least one at least one potential major lineage that facilitates us tapping into the sensing world on the lineage we're on. And again, let's keep that open. Don't lock yourself into one thing cuz I unfortunately said one but his apparently cuz there's a few other stories he has about knowing about the buildings whether they should be insured or not. So he was sort of a natural I think even one of his bosses caught that and said you know about these buildings in the first five minutes don't you? Yeah, one of our company executives said that. Yeah. They started to catch how good you were and that's why he rose to the big level in the insurance company that he got to before he retired. Right. Are you people following my drift here? I'm trying to show a flowth through factor., Okay., Uh, Steve, you got a nice simple one for us? I'll give you a simple one. Um, you know, for many years I uh wanted to be a rock and roll star and, uh get, on the stage and I, did it quite a bit, but I always was very self-conscious about my voice and so I always got in my own way. And uh I just recall it's it was just profound in, its simplicity. I was playing uh at, my house with a guitarist, a very good guitarist, and I started singing. And I'll have to I have it on tape somewhere. I should really go back and find it. And I did get out without realizing it. I just got out of myself and started singing from a place I didn't know where it came from, but it was it was like I like that when you're in the dark the black world and something comes in from the green world, you don't know where it came from because you we haven't been taught or versed in oh the world of sensing we're calling it right now. Oh, a flow through. Oh, go ahead. I'm sorry. Catch up. Yeah. So I, you know, I mean, I was stunned, but I was totally into it. And, and the thought that I had was, "Oh, so this is how these great singers do it." You know, I had no clue, but I was in that zone. Yeah. Okay. So, again, I think many of you, if not all of you, have had some flashroughs, flowth throughs. Okay. Now, maybe because you didn't know quite what happened, you made up stories, which just confuses the issue. But if you just play my game, uh that knowing things you shouldn't have known, having that capability for a moment or some moments, in your case, singing, uh that you're astounded. Where did that come from? That's a clue. Where did that come from? It's not your normal I'm going to try to do it better thing. It was just zoom a flow through. Yeah., Thank you. You people got the drift of what I'm playing with? I'm talking about the flow through from the sensing world calling it that manifest in the physical cuz it's so budded up. Okay. Apparently it's there going bing, bing more often than we know. Help me here. I'll give you one more if I may. When, I first met you, we were teasing at you were teaching at the church and I can't remember who was there or anything, but you all of a sudden had an uk the one of the young guys, strong guys, and you go I, don't remember what we were doing. You go, I can sense a hole in the energy right here, whatever. You put your finger there and he fell down or whatever, you know, whatever. It was just it was one of those complete energy techniques. And that was kind of the place where it transitioned to me that we were studying something else here. And I I'm not unfamiliar with that from yoga, but I'd never seen it in the martial arts world. Yeah., To get the impetus to trust it and to touch him there and have that happen. Not something I could figure out. I'm good, but I'm not that good kind of thing in the dark world. Uh there's something that ah you feel like saying it. you feel like doing it and there's a result like where the hell did that come from and you know you can't do it again. That's another clue. Uh anyway, you're getting a drift what we're trying to lay out here flow through from that what I'm calling the sensing world that manifests to different people at different times in different situations in different degrees. So, you got these sometimes maybe a quick mental flash through. Don't go there. Okay, I won't because something bigger. Okay, let me throw one of mine out. Uh, I'm with a very good uh swordsman, just me and him and a couple of bow cans. And he asked me to stand in a stance. Okay. And I think he's going to come in to show me where my openings are kind of thing. And I'm just for me I'm just standing there you know as best as I can in nice position whatever and sudden he starts to experience consternation and I realize he can't see an opening he can't come in now this is a really good swordsman and I'm nobody here and I he can't come in at which time he came in cuz wherever I was standing for that flow through to be there. Suddenly wasn't there cuz what the hell's going on? He, over there can't come in. Bing he came in. Of course that's my fast story. Uh I have a couple of others but that was pretty cool. Uh Susan, Susan ah should we shift to you sensing? sing., Let's go to the earlier years and not into your medical proficiency using this pattern. Uh we'll get to that hopefully soon. Uh you mentioned something to me on the phone about an iikido experience. It was in New Zealand. Can you hear me? Are you on? Yes, I'm on. Was there something in that story that could fit in here? yeah I guess flash through experiences one that came to mind was okay for you. Well, there were numerous. Okay, Susan. Susan, hang on. Let me check with people. Let's see if your voice is coming across. It's breaking a little bit here. Anything you can do there? She lives out in the boonies someplace. Well, I'm actually on the road. Um, okay. She's on the road. Yes. Try that. That sounded pretty good. Okay., Okay., So, yeah. describing that experience of Uking in New Zealand. And Susan, if I may just try speaking just slightly slower to let the Yeah., Yeah. Thank you. Lower volume. No, just slightly slower to let the digital analog slower., Okay. So the experience I had with you in New Zealand was such an intense hit that when I went down I couldn't didn't have any desire to get back up. And I'm sure other bouquets have had this kind of experience with you. And you checked on me to ask why I wasn't getting up. And the image that I had was of being hit by, you know, a 500B anchor. So it wasn't, you didn't notice me being more physical. I'm going to get this Wasn't that kind of power, but there was something boom there. Okay. Yeah., Good. Go ahead. And it was just something so out of the norm from a normal a normal hit, you know, it wasn't painful at all. It wasn't it was just so encompassing and overwhelmingly powerful. Yeah., Um, something bigger than me was there and that's what you got hit bit with. Yeah. Yes. Much bigger than you. Yes. Yeah. And you hit the deck. And come on, Susan. You told me more of this story on the phone. There was just there was just no sense of, getting up from that. Um there was no even desire really to get up at the moment., Could you tell us about the mattress? Dear God, I got to pull things out of you people. you laid out beautifully on the phone and then you suddenly come here and you know different experiences of being thrown by you where it's not again it's not landing on a mat it's landing on a you know a mattress that's a, floor below the, ground level. So it's way, below normal ground level. It's soft. It's soft. It's um again it's just not normal. It's different from the norm. Yeah. Oh, thank you. And this again is nothing I can control. I'm going to say I'm going to throw them and they're going to going to throw them and they're going to land on a mattress. I, can't control that. I don't know anything about that., I don't know anything about that. But apparently when I stand and sometimes, you know, uh when I stand properly that there's a little more rush through and that big hit was that cuz she's my UK. Uh, I care for her. I'm not going to try to damage her, you know, especially at a, demo class in New Zealand. Okay. But something big hitter, okay, that she described pretty well. And this mattress thing is something I've heard, especially the females say to me uh often. It looks from the outside like I threw them hard. And it may have, but they hit this mattress and they come up smiling or laughing. Some guys sitting on the outside who don't know me say, "You're kind of harsh on that lady, weren't you?" Cuz they don't know there's a, mattress there. If they would just watch the UK coming up smiling like, "Oo, that was nice. The mattress was nice." I don't think so. We don't know everything how this works. We're just trying to come up with some more examples and I'll study it more and more. We'll get a better create some better words so we could know when we're talking from the sensing world or describing it from that world. Uh, and what entails standing more fully in that world. Okay. So, that's where we really have to go. But I thought it'd be fun to hear your stories and for other people to hear your stories of a, flow through a bleed through. Uh what whatever. Help me here. Dear God, people. Uh since I got another one, if you want one for me. Hey, go ahead. I'm in a movie theater with my wife. The movie is over and they're playing the credits. So, we get up and we're getting ready to walk out and this older guy who was sitting in front of us also got up and he's looking at the credits and this guy who was sitting behind us told the guy to move because he couldn't see and the guy didn't move and he told him a couple of more times the guy didn't move. I could tell he was really getting mad and he was going to hit this guy. And all of a sudden, I was standing at a different place and the guy had to look around me and then he saw that the guy had a hearing aid and he couldn't hear him. And so that, diffused the situation. But I didn't even know I moved. Yeah., My wife said, "How did you do that?" Yes., Yes. And you said no idea. no idea. No idea. You can try to own it in, in this first world which we have a tendency of doing and say, "Well, I'm just really cool. I've been doing martial arts, honey. I'm cool." But yeah, you didn't know. No, I And that's our clue when other people say, "How did you do that? Why did you do that? How did you know that?" That's a good clue. That's a damn good clue. Yeah. Susan, stop the stupid car. Susan. Yes, I'm here. I will stop the car in a couple minutes. It'll be due. Uh some I wanted to give some examples of earlier in my work where I started to trust that the questions I asked people or the insights that I had that led to, you know, other questions for patients. I, So we're in your field of dealing with patients., Okay. She's talking about her earlier years that she's developing this. Are we okay so far there? Yeah. And people would, you know, other, therapists would ask, you know, how did you know to ask them that question?, And I did the same thing Noah said, I don't I don't know. That, question Yeah. just showed. Yeah. And it would often turn out to be a really critical question in understanding the patient or understanding their history., Yeah., Early, on I was um interviewing for a position with a one of the biggest um at the time orthopedic clinics in Marin County. and I really didn't have the experience that they were looking for. And part of the interview was evaluating one of the senior PTs. So, I was a little nervous, but I spent a few minutes feeling his system. And then he asked what I found and I went through, you know, what I felt. And he, was surprised because I didn't do the normal PT evaluation, but I picked up a lot about his system. And he was impressed by your we call it insights, maybe. Yes., And that was one of those moments where I really learned to trust. Yes., That information. Yeah., That was coming through from the sensing world., Yeah. Remember the doubter is in this first world of basics and there the doubter is really can be strong. Okay. And that one will block everything out. If you're a Bobby doubter, nothing more can happen. He doubts everything. You know, hey Bobby, do you know there's a Robert available? I doubt it. I'm Bobby. They can doubt you to death. Yeah. So trust. That damn word keeps coming up through the years here. Uh, TA loves it. Trust. I, got one. Who that? That's Amy from Florida. Hey Amy from Florida. Um you know besides things like when I wrote my book taking a reading later I saw that I used words that I didn't know that I knew, you know. But the one that really comes to me is my father had died and um uh it was, you know, a while later and I come home from work in the morning and I sense a presence in the room, and at first I kind of like fluff it off, you know, but I really sense this presence and I these are not the right words but kind of like I hear my father say to me, "Take care of your mother." And I, flip it off, you know, fluff it off. I'm making it up. And I keep hearing it. Take care of your mother. So I turn around. I say, "I always take care of my mother." And he says, "No, take care of your mother." That afternoon, my mother had a stroke. I'm laughing. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to laugh. Yeah. Oh, okay. In the sensing world,, I, just want to I, just want to not have people think they only get stuff from their father or their grandmother who's dead and stuff. I don't want to lock them into that. Okay? So, what I say is based on that in the sensing world, you can begin to sense the presence of beings who have passed on. Okay? These used to happen to me a lot where even people that weren't necessarily friends as people I happen to know would pass by and say, "Hey, I'm doing great." Da, da, da. And okay, great. Thanks. Uh, but they would, but now in retrospect, I was a little more settled and to some degree in a sensing world. So, it was easy to pick up on them. So, that's all I'll put that. But, let's not box the sensing world just into dead people talking to you. Okay. Yeah. All right. So, you understand my, thing there. Amy, your pictures always smiling, so I guess it's okay. Amy, you okay with me here? Um, I'm not sure. But I said something nice. I said in the sensing world, it's easier to pick up beings who are in another dimension because in the sensing world, they're more available. Yeah. So, yes, but let's not lock the sensing world into only dead people talk to me in the sensing world. Yeah. That's all I want to get across to people. I ain't necessarily even talking to you. Yeah. I just want to make sure nobody out there misunderstands. Yeah. Okay., So, sometimes people I make corrections or add-ons and you think I'm talking to you. I ain't talking to you. I'm talking to the other 30 people, whoever is, on, hoping no one misunderstands what you said. I'm not saying you're a screwing up. I didn't say that at all. And if I say that, you'll know. It'll be a little different wording. Anyway, where the hell are we? Oh, now one thing I don't know yet is this degree. Again, we get these maybe mental flashroughs, but then we start to get some that are more fully, like me with the bokeh. that was more fullbodied, I guess because he couldn't come in. Okay. So there was something a bigger field there I would surmise. Okay., Ah so again what's the difference between a quickie where you can know something for a moment or maybe Noah's he, just stepped over here just a quickie but that he moved and he didn't think about moving. It wasn't a I think I'll move to protect this poor old man. He just moved. Uh there's little quickies like that, but also there's these bigger ones I have. And I'll have to sort of diagram that out and maybe label those like I don't know in the sensing world there was a level one and a level two and a level three or a 2-in pipeline, a 3-in pipeline, a 4in pipeline. I don't know if I want to get that tight with it, but cuz we hear other stories. A great one I heard talking on the phone to Oliver who lives in Scotland now. He's a collegiate teacher uh university and he likes my work. He's visited out and I was mentioning this is the area I was going to play in tonight and he said, "Oo, I got one." He's 21 years old. He's late for something and he says he's running lickickety split, whatever words he used in his English Scottish form. But he said it again and again later, how fast he was running, how into the run he was. He gets to the crest of this little hill he's running up and apparently right there's a street and a curb, but he said right there he ran into a wall. not a physical wall, what you call it, an energy wall, stopped him fully. He didn't say, "Oh, there's a car. I better slow down." He didn't say, "Holy let me dig my feet in here cuz I'm racing this way." He, didn't see the car. He just bang got stopped fully. He ran into a wall at which time a car was coming by so close that the rear view mirror scraped his clothing as it drove by. So uh so these flashroughs, flowthroughs, bleedth throughs uh apparently can be fuller and fuller and fuller., Okay. So far what I had one I have to talk to him tomorrow. We have coffee tomorrow uh to go over his car story. He's driving and he's not a particularly fantastic driver. Uh and anyway, he went over a cliff, and I forget so I want to go over it with him tomorrow, but it's something like, the car took itself over and steered into a tree there. He may have been impelled to steer it into the trees. So again, I'll go over the details, but it was something like that. And thank God the tree was there cuz it stopped the car. If there had if he hadn't and it was not straight in front of him there was there was an effort by something to hit the tree which is over here. Thank God because if he had continued a big cliff he's dead man. So uh eventually as we get better with this uh I'm sort of wondering how big can this be uh if I look at old sensei as, say operating from this level not, that he wasn't better than this I have to fine-tune that with him but, that he was in a sensing world and for example guys would stand behind him with boan or Joe stick and boom and he wouldn't be there anymore. Okay, he'd be over here. But he'd do that one often. He's saying what? Let me paraphrase him. In this world of sensing, if that moves, this moves. Cuz the harmony in here we go. The harmony in a sensing world is different than how we talk about that in our first aware, first aware normal world., The normal world is a bit of is it this or is it that okay in this underlying world it's its own world has its own way of doing things has its own flavor of itself. Okay. and the better harmony, the two things that were is it that or is it this uh it doesn't exist that way there apparently that that's when they're beginning to show a real relationship. I call it they're dancing with each other. Okay. So, if this moves, this moves. If this moves, that moves. They're starting to dance with each other. Actually, there's an actual energy presence that accounts for this. How are we doing it? Where are we? Okay, let's go back over that. Now, we're going to try to figure it out and be aware of it from this first world. And I have to say again, you really can't do it that way. You really can't, do it that way. You really can't because this sensing world is its own world with its own vibrational rate. It as you move into this world, and we'll talk about I think a better way of moving into it. Uh it'll appear bigger at first. Okay. Now, they're the same size,, but, we may have condensed oursel in this normal world where we're still a bit boxed in a certain way or boxed in boxed in a certain way or boxed in through years of being boxed in. We sort of think that's it. Okay. So, your first sense of moving into being I hate to use the word aware, that's beginning to sense this other world. It might show bigger. Okay. It might show stronger, more powerful because this world in this in our normal world, I use the word energies., Okay. If Bobby wants to pick up the pace and be a Robert, he beats energies a little bit. Boom. There's a Robert. Robert wants to move on and be an adult. Uses the energy patterns or up and down is how I first started. in and out also another way uh and boom I'm more an I'm not, kind of thing okay but the second universe is a finer setup so I call it alive it's alive and it has its own rules remember the rules here was is it this or is it that it has to be one or the other no way can it be both okay But in this world, oh, something different here. They're, merging with each other. And as we move on, uh they'll even probably show more of that even at a better level, could I say? Okay. Now in case we run out of time here uh we have time but uh we've asked you in this normal world my past teachings have been how to get deeper and I called it pools of energy one form or an under floor a deeper floor and you settle and you open kind of quiet or dark and, and you have a feeling that uh that feels like a floor and standing from that floor that floor has more to offer. It's a pool of energy and with that extra pool of energy up and down and ah easier for Bobby to become a Robert or Robert to become a nad. So we've used under in kind of an energy sense. Okay. And we can all probably go a bit deeper with that just that way of using it. Hope you're following me. But if we're going to move from this first world to the uh sensing world, a deeper sense of down and, and we're shifting there into this world of sensing of sensing come up into a different world. So do be clear. What is that? Do be clear uh that we're not using the that style which is very good in first universe for development. Very important. Okay. The up and down and the depth height, the in and out. Both of those are fantastically important to play with in the first normal world. Okay. Some of you have been playing in there for years with me. Okay. Now to shift into a sensing world a good trick settle even deeper, deeper reach a point where it's where you're maybe more open and there's another world we're calling the sensing world. So be prepared for a sense of size. Don't be too quick to try to figure things out. You should have learned that in this first realm world. Okay?, And I'll clue you into a couple of things. But you have to experience cuz your experience may be a hair different than mine. It follows the same pattern. I'm not saying you get to do a different pattern. I won't go there. But your, experience, how you flavor it is yours. So I can't tell you everything what you'll feel. You have to get in and have that experience. Okay. So from deeper a world sensing world it's more alive. It may in some form show stronger. Watch out for that one. That could push you away if you're not sort of used to opening to more. It could push you away cuz it's a lot more than, the extra energy from Bobbert to Robert. Bobby to Robert. There's a little more energy from Robert. A little, more energy from Robert. A little more energy. You're starting to be an earlier major. Okay. So,, as you settle deep enough, open more open more and then play the game of a sensing world. A sensing world. And hang out there experientially. Let it lay itself out experientially. You can't just continue being aware and intelligent a certain way. That's the rules here on this half of the board. And there's more. But that's okay. Uh but you're entering this world. It has its own rules, has its own flavor of itself. Okay. Did I say that? Okay, best I can say it at the moment. Okay, more stories. Somebody you tracking what I'm trying to do here. Yeah, Bob. A couple things, Steve?, Yeah. One thing we, had talked about where people may remember stories that um relate to their lineage, something that, they normally uh would be attuned to and, and uh so I, was thinking about another example and wondering if as we get in tap into that sensing world, how it affects others sensing worlds. Uh and, the example, uh I was coming from a class at night. I can answer this immediately but go ahead., What's excuse me if you're sensing and anyone is settled kind of sensitive they ought to pick up that oh he's sensing they ought to have or may not even know that it get well let me just give you the example. Yes please. So, so I'm at the market and uh I h I've, I've got some songs and, I'm always looking at, uh and yeah, I'm from LA, so you run into people all the time. So, who's in the market? But Rick Nelson. Ricky Nelson for those of you that uh remember. Um and I'm getting close to the checkout line. He's there with some woman and he's in another line. So, we're side by side, one, checkout line and another. And you know, I don't like to bother these people and all, but I've got this great song for him. And I said, "Well, I make a deal with myself. If, I get out of the line first, I'll talk to him. If he gets out first, it's, over. I'll let it go." Well, sure enough, he gets out of the line first. He's at the front. I'm, just about ready to put my groceries down. And I don't know what impelled me, but I went like that. I didn't say a word. I just went like that. He turns around and he's with somebody else. He turns around, comes over, and we start having a conversation about this song, you know, and he gave me a, contact number and all. Nothing came of it. But, it was it was it was like here's this guy who, somehow got a message from me because I was impelled to, uh to call him without saying a word. Did you ever think that you have the magic snappers? Did you ever think maybe you're a magician and whatever you want you can just summon? Well, that's where we have to be careful when we take these happenings into the normal world. the stories people can make up and then for days after they're trying to get people to turn around and look at them. I'm, joking, but I'm serious. Don't go crazy with this in the heavier world., Yeah,, I said it in NO speak, but I think you heard me. Now, again, not talking to you. I'm talking to the troops. Cool., But we're talking we're talking about two different people, right? The one who's connected to both realms and the one who's only in the one realm and the can't the one who's only in the normal realm, he goes crazy and makes crazy stories. The one who's in the whole realm, he's actually telling the truth or something. Yeah., No, I'm saying what people will do when they know about this or if they if they get a flash through and they've had an experience, then the wild stories they come up with about why that happened or how that happened is all I'm trying to say. Are we sort of on the same wavelength? Did I miss something? Very much. Very much. Yeah. I I'm just cautioning people not to be too stupid and that's an impossible thing. Uh cuz the human condition, unfortunately has a strong draw cartoon about limmings in the paper lately and it's like it's the limmings. One goes over now get a whole crowd going over. Anyway, uh stop me before I go crazy here. Uh who do I want to talk to? Uh TJ, do you want to say anything about the uh the uh Oh, wait a minute. I want to go back to Noah, too. Ta, do you want to say something about the uh bird lady, the crow lady? Oh, yeah. Uh it's this is this is a kind of a of a bleedth through or a connection to this type of dimension. Uh years ago and not that many years ago I was teaching a retreat and I met a woman who um when we were talking she said you know I, can talk with crows. I have crows and they just come up to me and we hang out. hang out. Said hang out. And uh I said, "Well, you know, that's very interesting." And she showed me pictures and so on. She had birds all over her cracking up stuff like that, you know, a minor St. Francis that in, a way. And so, uh I ask her kind of from, this level. I say, you know, uh how does this happen? And are you are you listening to the number of cause that they make? Are you listening to the rhythm of their cause? CA. And she said yes and no. So this was the interesting thing that it wasn't just from it wasn't just a mechanical referencing of listening to the number of times they make their sound or the rhythm of it. It was it was deeper than that but it included that. Yes. Okay. Let's say it this way. We talked about this. Let's say it better. Hopefully, you're establishing lineage. When Susan does her work, she sits with the client, does the normal scan, and then continues into a, finer of sensing and boom,, boom, boom. Really developing will uh that we're establishing a lineage. So, I think I think it's time for me to relate to the bird. So, of course, you'd see them first, listen to their chatter for a moment. But that's not where she's really, making she's just establishing lineage. Yeah., Yeah. She was a she whether she knew it at first, she was a crow whisperer, you know., Yeah. Apparently. Yeah., Apparently. Yeah. She a and it just continued to, develop and she had all these stories about, connection and, what they can how they perceive uh their environment, their nature and human beings. And you mentioned to me that you could sense that she was sensing as she was laying this out. Well, it was like when I asked her about the mechanics, you know, asking about the mechanics of what was taking place. Are you listening to the to the rhythm? Are you listening because that's my lineage, right? That Yes., Yes., I'm kind of trying to relate to this from, my lineage. Yeah. From what he knows and is good at in this first world. In the first world. And then she said yes and no. And when she said yes and no, it's like, oh yeah, I kind of I understand that place. It includes it is it's not exclusive of this other stuff, but it includes something else. It's Yeah. It's, not a, yes and no here. It's a yes. That's true, but no, I hear from another level also. Yes., Yeah. And that filled it out. That, actually for her was a full experience. And I felt her experience of that., Yeah., Not that I'm going to be a crow whisperer., Yeah., But I but I um I could kind of there was a, sympotico a an appreciation that was taking place there. You see, there's a lot we don't know about this world of sensing. uh you know somebody is pretty cool, they have some degree of it or they can hold a certain consistency and make money as a uh psychic in whatever form. Okay, where am I going? Where am I going? But it doesn't mean that they in their the way they're a psychic can, pick horses to win or pick companies that are going to triple in the next two months or this year. Uh that we can't expect them to have a fullblown thing out there. Okay. Yeah. Susan's got her lineage, right? Yeah. Susan's got her line. She's got her lineage. But you're not going to ask her. Choose some good stocks for me, Susan. You know, I might try her out. I tried Noah orientist. I tried Noah out once on it. We spent some time with it. He's a nice guy. He was trying to help me out here with this. Uh but didn't quite go where go anywhere really. Uh and now I say, "Oh it wasn't his lineage." Yeah. But I used to practice a lot with my groups uh, you know of trying out different things uh that probably weren't their lineage but for fun practice, you know I used to take a group of four I don't know four or five I don't remember maybe Diana remembers if she was there at the track time and we go to the track and say which horse is going to win kind of thing. I was just experimenting because I didn't know all the rules at that time. We're going back now, you know, 50 years or something or more., Go ahead. Sorry. I was just going to say the Elaine Yodar story too about her, dropping in to the space to understand what happened to that bridge and you know here you're, having u or they're having millions of dollars and, all the expert all the structural engineers from everywhere. Yeah., and, Elaine gets it like in Yeah. So, let me tell the story again in case, or just to say it again. Yeah. Say it again. I'm doing what I normally do in front of. So, I hear about this uh overpass they were building that collapsed. Six guys were working on it and they got killed. Six eight six I think six guys got killed. Collapse. And we heard about this from some company that sends engineers and all the different types to go study what happened., So for practice, I say, Elaine, let's check this, overpass thing that fell over. We're into it. I swear to God, may have been over five minutes, but it was before 10. Okay. Bang. She picks up the first pier support. She moves into the second pier support. Boom. The ground is soft. The ground's bad. They shouldn't have put a support pier on that ground. You know what they found out after they sent all the engineers? That ground there had been used as a dump. So, of course, it wasn't stable. They didn't check the ground apparently properly. She picked that up in less than 10 minutes after they sent all these engineers for how much that must have cost him. Yeah. I love the story. That's sensing when you know something that it's impossible for you to know. She never saw the bridge. Nobody sent us pictures of a of an overpass. Uh just in the dojo. We're in the dojo just settling and walking and sensing. Boom. I screwed that one up. I saw the first pier, but I for some reason went up into the cement and was tracking the cement. Did they dry it long enough? Did they cheat on the on the whatever of C? I don't know anything about cement, but did they did they cheat on the product and use cheaper cement or something? I was out there tracking. Uh I stupid me. I didn't notice it started with that and I should have followed with that. She did. I, did didn't. So catch some, miss some. Anyway, that was funny. Uh the story I love the veterinarian. Okay, we're in Eland property walking along. I'm very interested in her cuz she's a sensitive. I can feel it. And we're just dialoguing. Fairly new meat uh at her and she happens to glance over there dog in the yard. She said he's got a bad back. Again, I have a pretty good eye for dogs. I worked in kennels. I was a dog trainer. I made money training dogs. Da, da. Went to dog shows over and over again, you know. So, I got not a bad eye for dogs, but let's give her the benefit. She's a vet. She, sees more dogs than I do at that stage of the game, which is okay. Oh, he's got a bad back. Okay. But when she added, "Because, the kids are riding on his back." Oh, wait a minute. Now we I knew there were kids living there. You can see a couple of toys in the yard, but there are no kids near the dog or no kids in the yard at the time. I want to check her out. her out. Okay. Again, I have a good feeling for this lady. We became friends for a bit. It was nice. Nice lady. Uh, I'm very sensitive. I knocked on the door. Lady come to the door. I said, "Did you know your dog has a bad back? Bang." She comes right back at me. Yes. The kids have been riding on the back. We asked them not to, but you know, kids, how did she know this? There was nothing viable., There's a good clue. They know things. How did you know that? Okay, Susan has a bunch of stories of people saying when she does something or says something, why did you do that? Why did you say that? Okay, from the sensing world, it's not as apparent. Okay, so that's a clue with the sensing world., Sensei to um to quote you, you used to say fields relate with fields. When you're in one field, if you're in a field of intelligence, it relates with other fields of intelligence and it shares them intimately. Yeah. That's why they have what's that? Smart people's club. Men, thank you. That's why they have such things. The smart brainy people want to hang out with smart brainy people and compare their mentors. No, but it's more than that. It's like when you when you're sensing something when you're scanning the field of another person's field I as UK sense that field intelligence scanning me my field of intelligence and that helps me to relate to the field of awareness. Yeah, that's why uh okay can tell a few stories there but uh yes when somebody is in a particular level or field of anyone who has any interested in that can start to absorb or be affected by that., Okay., Uh, so I tried to say that earlier. I forgot what the conversation was. Uh, when O sensei was at the dojo, it was easy to know cuz the place would hum when he'd leave town for the weekend or whatever, the hum would quiet down. When he came back, the hum would increase. I knew to the m well not to the moment but I knew when he was out of town. I knew when he was back in town because his presence was humming the place., Okay. And they were affected by that in some ways to some degrees. Okay., Uh so there's a couple others like that. I'm blink blinking at the moment. Well, there was a time when I hadn't uk for you in I don't know quite a while for whatever reason. We were in New Zealand and I just could see you needed my help as it were. I went up to grab you and it was like um what did the guy say after he hit O sensei on the head? Is that a normal head Oisha? That's how I felt. I said is that a normal arm in the do it was just there was just a kind of energy, and in that dimension you know of course we're trying to feel it but it was like it was different. I don't know what else to say. And that I doubt was this world aliveness. That was a dimensional level in this first world. It wasn't Bobby cuz you grab Bobby and he's a man back off., It was another level of whatever level of Robert with his energy body. So you grab that and you're grabbing an energy body, but we're still in the domain here of, of that first thing. Yeah. I don't want Yeah. Okay. Yeah., Yeah. I mean, I'd go back with Amy's kind of whatever it was. There's a part of me that's going like, "God, am I, you know, whatever it was?" So, but at the time it was so visceral. Yeah., I, think here's a great uh example of harmony. When you when two things coales into a state of harmony, much greater things are available. And it seems I mean I remember um being thrown by you early on and thinking I want to get a pressuret treated floor to figure out what's going on because he didn't throw me and I can't leap that far and I end up being farther away from him than seems possible. Um and, um now I just accept it as yeah that's harmony. That's what happens when, something happens harmonically. Yeah. And again, not to screw up a simple map. We're going to throw in a new word here, which may be all right and whatever, whatever. But I'm trying to keep this kind of simple and acceptable and reachable experientially. Yeah. All right. So, we've changed so many words here and that's why I jumped on uh careful of thinking only dead people come to me when I'm uh when I'm in this place. Yeah, because it's a finer sensing. You'll sense them better. But let's not lock it in on that. So, I'm just sort of saying around the same thing. Yeah. Harmony. I already said that the harmony factor in the sensing world is different than in our first world. Yeah. So, I'll go there with you. Yeah,, my first one that I remember that I remember. Who knows what the first one was. It might have been when I was 8 years old and whatever. Uh I'm in the dojo fairly new. Uh definitely my first year uh home dojo. And uh I got two UK's and one I'm dealing with one and, another UK came in and I just put my arm out with no, intent no intent to do anything. I was busy with this guy. I'm still like a, you know, a white belt or something. And this guy grabs my arm and he flies back. Now, I didn't go. I didn't do anything. He just flew back. Of course. What the hell was that? Of course. I can't practice it. I don't know what happened. I can't believe the guy came for me. Not the way he flew. Yeah. So, I think you all remember that first clear one. It's almost like you can't forget it because it was so whoa. But watch out for those words of I don't know what happened or somebody else says to you, "Where'd you come? That was fantastic. Why' you say that?" Yeah. Sometimes at Essin I, could tell when something was coming through uh in giving a lecture at Eselin happened more than once where I'd start to speak about a subject that I hadn't intended to speak about or even it was one I really knew anything about and sort of the tone of my voice would change. It's almost like I didn't recognize my own voice, nor did I recognize what I was saying,, but that would catch me cuz it was like Steve's the singing voice, not your normal cracky voice. Yeah. So, is there something about that, Yeah. Well, I had that same thing there. It wasn't my normal voice. And I wasn't, my normal voice. And I wasn't putting on to do anything. I was just talking about this subject, whatever it was. Invariably, somebody would come up to me after class and say, "You were talking to me." Well, I kind of knew I was talking to somebody just because I never talk this way. I never talk about that particular subject that way. So, of course, did I say that right? Somebody needed the message and for some reason it worked through me to them. Talk about being a channel from what to what. Yeah. Don't know if I said that story well, but anyway, dear God. Anyway, what I'm trying to do here is best as I can keep it simple in a certain way that it's not that far away. Uh you don't have to whatever go crazy uh with whatever whatever. Easy. Settle. Do your basics. We're settling deeper and we're doing our basics. settle deeper, open, okay? And having a sense of the depths. Hopefully, you should have knowing you're not working when something starts to happen there. You're not working a normal a bigger pool of oil for energy for Nad to become uh sensei or something that starting to get into a different zone here. Okay. So, so we need that sense of it to get into the different zone of the world there. That is I call the sensing world. I like the coming up cuz hopefully and sensei pushes this uh that in coming up there's a more sense of experiential. Okay, that apparently you can in your smartness awareness shift into these different worlds. But, you're always missing something. You're missing the experience. So I was surprised to hear from O say that, one could shift into finer and finer with just being smart or whatever, being aware or whatever. Uh cuz I was thought you needed a fuller package to shift in. But the problem is still there. You shift into a finer a finer and a finer. Okay., But you're missing half of the story there., That stuff that mixes up what we call a body., The stuff of creation is not being experienced. Could be knowing. Oh, there's stuff there, but it's not being experienced. So coming up from under helps, facilitates more experiential. Okay. More experiential. Word of warning to you or a helpful trick for you. Again, don't know if I said that right. We're beginning to run out of time. Anybody with some exciting flow through, bleed through, whatever, whatever. Come on. There must be somebody who's not a normal., I got one for you, Sensei. Who's that? This is Roy. Roy,, Roy,, I had shared this with you before and uh with some people before. I was uh leaving work one day on the way to the dojo. So I had all my gear and uh I was waiting for the street car to come and uh so the street car comes and you I climb up the stairs to get into the street car. I wand myself in with my fastpass and then just take a seat and uh you know then the street car starts to move and you know I'm looking around because I took a seat next to this woman that was sitting there and uh kind of boxed her in with all of my gear and myself kind of squashed her in and I was looking around the street car and I realized that there's nobody else in the entire car and I sit next to this woman right and so I'm sitting there you're lucky she didn't call the police man., Yeah. Right. Exactly. These days, that's a dangerous thing to do., Exactly., And you know, as I'm looking around, I'm thinking to myself, you know, what am I doing here? I mean, I should be sitting over there and I was thinking I should move and blah, blah blah. My mind is going nuts with and I just I just settled. I just said, you know, I'm just going to sit here, right? And I just sat there. I settled. And then at the very next stop, this old lady is getting on and she's climbing up the stairs. She's got this, you know, cane. She can hardly make her way up these, you know, four stairs to get into the street car. She wands herself in, you know, with the machine and then the street car takes off and she comes barreling down the aisle and I was sitting right at the aisle and I just reached my hand out like this quickly and just stopped her dead in her tracks. Right. Just immediately stopped her dead and then I just motioned for her to sit, you know, just have a seat. take a seat in the seat across from me. And she says, "Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you." You know, she's very, you know, uh, thankful about the whole thing. And I said, "No, no, it's okay. No problem." She goes, "No, no, you don't know how important this was." And she said, so later she tells me the story that she had just come from the doctor and the doctor had told her that she had a fracture in her hip. So, if she would have pitched her weight, this woman was going down, right? I mean, I stopped this woman from going down. And so I realized later break, huh? I Yeah, I realized later that, you know, Yeah, it was one thing. I've trained for so many years, right? I mean, yeah, I stopped her. That wasn't that big a deal. But the fact that I stayed in that seat, right? I had no business being in that seat, right? The whole street car was empty and I just that was where I stayed and I allowed this whatever was there, to just be there. Yeah., Yeah, that's a cute story. Yeah. Um, you see, again, he could have owned it by saying, "Well, I train. I'm a Nike doist. Of course, I'm fast." But to include all the other stuff, the you know why he sat there cuz really it was not a good place to sit. You and the one lady on the damn bus. Hey man, dangerous. Dangerous, right? They could have hung me for less than, uh but yeah, nice story. Thank you, Ray. people. I think we ran out of time here. Uh so mull on your experiences. Uh we've got more to hear from Susan about the why this is great. This sensing is say using Susan for example uh as she continues working in the sensing realm the I don't know it's called Susan can you still hear me? Her yes I can. yes I can. Yeah. So we first start. Let me fill in anything I missed. The physical body, of course. Okay. Some degree of energy movement through the body. Of course, say yes., Yes. Okay. Unless you want to slip something else in here. Uh maybe a finer level of their energy system in relation to their, energy system in relation to their body. Yeah. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. But then it began to open up more and the family's relationship, let's say it's a child here, the family's relationship with the child starts to show if they're screwing the kid up or something. She continues doing great work here. And oh, if it's a past life carryover that begins to show about there, okay, self,, the magnificent self of that character begins to show there to the point where you can sort of dialogue and help it guide you in about its character. That's a pretty good move. And there is more. Don't know what it is yet. We need time in here. But you see that, progression. Yeah. I mean, you see the progression from the vet. Okay. She's got a good eye. He's got a bad back. Okay. But to know why. the bridge falling uh thing. Uh, that's cool to have these abilities. I mean, what if we sense better? Okay, we just created a new drug. Is there a level in sensing that says, okay, what's the benefit? And it lays that out. And you say, what's the potential bad stuff? Some drugs have killed people, right? Where you got to pull it out the market real fast. That all that should be available and more. Dear God people, this is I want to say f you fantastic world. Okay. And so much more we can talk about here. But anyway, I just wanted to get the some of the stories of the flow through, give you a quick hint at the approach and the entry into it, and you go and play a while. I'll see you in a couple of weeks. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks, Sensei. Everyone, thank you, Sensei. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, Bob. And unmute and say goodbye if you'd like. Please do. Thank you, Sensei. Thank you, TJ. Pleasure. Thanks, everybody.

okay and everyone else hi High, okay get my notebook here making notes on this [Music], session maybe a find out what you've been doing because you've had a nice break here what great awareness developmental work have you been doing had you bumped into quote insights experientially uh questions along the way 's let's dialogue for, a little bit if you like you're a pathetic group I'll say something Sensei This is Dusty that's okay yeah I've had an interesting summer I've gone through some um health challenges and I'm now like literally kind of rewiring my ner nervous system like literally from my center and I was talking to you a while ago about how I get nervous with time and you said talk about it another time I get anxiety when people are late or when I'm running late and I guess I'm wondering like if you had any Su you said you might have some suggestions there possibly yeah, maybe if time gets short you're boxing into from your two by two to a one by one and even tighter so maybe time and that boxing in have a relationship see yeah really get into I I'm running out of time what you're saying is I'm boxing myself in more that's what you're feeling my wild guess of the moment okay and the more time you're running out of the more you tighten that, one buy into a half bu into a whatever buy that's my guess of the moment the moment have fun with that yeah that's thank you right on love it can't go wrong with acknowledging there's more room okay you know I can move around and go to the to the kitchen and eat and probably dry my C without acknowledging it but it's a fun if you play with it easy what I used to do with estland I remember, how much room is here when I was walking in the morning to the dining hall and I'd have a sense of you know so much space and then I'd go okay how much room is really here and whoa instantly it was a much bigger space and all the more fluidity whatever that goes on in a bigger space was, there uh so what uh it the bigger space was there but I had to acknowledge it call out to it okay so a lot of things we don't have to do as a weird Bobby human being I can get by but we're not practicing we're not practice more you know in these odd moments between things practice yeah I don't have to do a big deal to go up this flight of stairs here uh but often that's my practice I stop for a moment I got to shift from normal Bobby to Stair climber easy energies makx pretty fast now and I can get up the stairs a bit better not quite ready for a stair elevator yet but up to you up to you up to you right if you're interested if you're an Inquirer that would catch your attention but whatever that's, your thing okay did anybody come up with something thank you on that uh Dusty somebody CH Chris here from New Zealand hey Chris the um was probably a little bit on the same theme to be honest I've had um quite a hectic few weeks both work and sort of home life as well so and quite often when I'm getting that hectic moment um sensing the almost the space or that almost the in the theme we've just spoken about the 3X3 or the, 4x4 close by and having an awareness that it's there and that I'm not you're in that se that wrong place and you need to shift settle and shift into that space um so having an awareness that there um all those qualities are close by but need to shift into that space or harmonize with that space um and taking the time to do that yeah connecting with that space and experience is there a questionnaire or just what you've been doing just what just what you've been doing just what I've been working and noticing over the last few weeks in my yeah so, yeah there's a naturalness let's say in a larger space let's say Bobby space one by one what okay easy settle open there a 2 by two space the energies qualities whatever you want to call them that are there are mixing up Robert he stands taller he's got a little more backup he's a little more efficient his voice begins to change a bit his presence changes a bit from I'm not sure if I should be here to hello I'm here is it, okay so that mix is natural so you can I don't know maybe you want to give it an extra moment and appreciation with that who am I now kind of thing as an experience who should I be who could I be natural experiential who am I now easy, boom yeah I, think and I think it's nice to recognize that that's your that separation and that you can shift to that space which I always have to yeah it's right here the border between a one by to a two by yeah they could look like heavy walls but that should be part of the practice where you after a while begin to realize easy I can pass through these they're not walls that keep you out unless you're really dense then they will because you can't go into finer when you're that dense but easy, boom passing through no, big deal after that yeah and then some of those things are a lot there's a lot more clarity in those nicer things of there where it was confusing before things get simpler which I qu that's the, beauty of it should be so and later get faster and you know well it's, always fascinating how we're sort of not in that space how we're bumped out of that space all the time but it's nice to recognize that you can shift you're out of it and you can move to that space and hopefully align with that space and the, gifts that are there for in that space are there for you yeah if you can do that watch I'm trying to be a martial artist oh yeah cuz G I feel like I'm in a nice space walking down the street suddenly this guy jumps out from the alleyway and says hey [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] very aggressive big body of course you might be bumped right there but you got to hate and hit that space or a better space to be equal to that situation if you can't do that you better get out of martial, arts right thank you okay somebody anything here we'll move along in a m moment but we got time somebody nothing yeah Bob you know I just find that, utilizing the uh you know the count the one by one two by two Etc you know it's just a good immediate like you say immediate switch like you know when I'm tight one by one recognizing it just calling it pretty much will, kick me into a 2 by two naturally because there's a recognition that this is a tight space the 2 by two is say waiting for, me to open up a little, Etc and then I find that the um you know calling on, the sensing don't jump me here okay, all right but along the same lines so I won't even go any right yeah uh yeah after a while it's a quick hate kind of thing well since I could cover I don't know what to call it uh go from you know the old man to the Vio whatever in uh and it was Bast and they all was that's fast y so we can use them 's own sounds or sense of it yeah but just saying after a while it should be so should be so yeah is it is it with the thought that the that space is there we just need to align to that space and all the resources are there hidden we just have to there's a sense that there's an alignment for us to be aligned with that space to yeah but, if you get your basics down you know it's a bit deeper there's a center circle, Center yeah you're there you don't got to bring in a measuring tool and, and look at your compass for 15 minutes to see if you're lined up and centered you know come on it's faster ni now again stipulation watch out mental people for oh yeah I'm there and it's all mental and it's no somebody's not home okay so watch out for the word fast when I say fast I mean an experiential fast if I say hey there better be a n do here That's My Style by the way so don't try to say to, be a better Lev you got a growl and I just like okay I have fun with that one uh you could be sweeter you could be prettier you could be more sensitively aware that's, yours so don't, mind me I tend to be the monster type for a little while at first tickles, me remember I showed you my, beautiful Uh Wood block print with Goro up gling the bamboo anyway so let's, get on the subject, ah the sensing Highway okay what I'm trying to do tonight is okay so here we are in the Manifest world and uh colors don't show but that's green and this is green okay and we do our basic one by two by three by Bobby Robert not do bad day fair day good day great day you know blah, blah, okay and whatever words you want to use with that as long as it sort of follows that pattern so to speak okay now and that world can go on finer and finer and finer apparently virtually forever but you don't get more original well since he likes that word go from finer to more original okay so here the more original is the sensing world that, next Circle okay so we just need a little bit of Bobby Robert n or one by two by3 by and sensing, world or sensing to a sensing world will stretch it out a little bit here okay we are we all right so, far, now, apparently uh even at a Bobby's level there is sensing there okay and so what I'm heading for tonight if I can say it right is sensing and keep following sensing maybe a sense of finer sensing or more sensing I add on very quickly experiential sensing so it doesn't become just an awareness idea again we have to be careful of that you'll miss a major half of creation again for lack of word experiential sensing, okay in the experiential sensing at whatever level yes you'll be aware of things intelligence about things but it's through the experiential sensing that, will, come, in all right is that piece okay just again over and over again Watch off of just being aware and aware and aware and you're missing something very important I call it the other half uh or if that's the mind the body but I hate to use body because body no I mean the experiential of whatever level you're at here you know but there's a character that's character there's a character all along the way just finer character okay so one of those things I said this old man he was referring to his character at that level and then he later use something like uho and you better be careful here because there's a lot of power is he had a different character sense of himself experiential sense of himself okay and then there's a even another one which I won't get into because we're in the Divine element here it won't help you any other than this thing of characters continue all the away okay sometimes a misunderstanding because you get a finer sense of things and you think oh there ain't no body here just me floating around a wear uh no if you double check there's a character at that level now his body may not feel as heavy as this right but there's a something akin to a body there a presence a field of energy body uh what whatever are we sort of okay with, with that b kind of old Basics I hope okay so what I want to do tonight oh that sensing is here uh I said to Sensei once uh I'm not sure I understand this word sensing what that is and he said you, use it you're just not aware of it but you use it I thought I use it then later he said you know when you go from Bobby to Robert you're using it oh so just in that there's a sensing in this more open space who am I and then this, mix happens and this character better in his world in the world of character uh so a lot of sensing in, there okay so anyway sensing apparently exists here but we may not be aware of it like me being kind of heavy dumb took me a while to figure out what it was as its own, piece uh but if we play for, simple Basics at least settle be present at least okay now I'm not asking you to go through a two buy and a three buy and a four buy I know those of you been around getting little bored which is that fine but a momentary whatever ah and then sensing, and again experiential sensing, and again experiential sensing what the hell that means sensing and just, play and we'll move from that word, uh let me thr here again you can't see the colors but uh, the hidden here is this uh Violet kind of kind of color that there is present here in the Manifest a sensing presence but some so may not notice it but as you play with just sensing, sensing so that's what I'm asking you to do play with this sensing easy sensing okay why I'm doing this is I'm trying to get a straight shop trying to get a faster what we used to call a travel vehicle okay into this next World okay so I'm trying to cut back the need biger knees trying to cut back the, time trying to cut back the distance factor to that that's already here okay so this hidden world is here but I can't see it CU I'm in Bobby's level okay oh I can learn it if you tell me yes, Mr preacher I believe you or something yeah but to experience it that's the game so the sensing world is here so if you fun around with sensing start with anytime you start with where you start okay play with sensing, sensing I'm hoping by doing that, when you move into the this one here the whole world the whole universe the whole, world the whole universe the whole whatever word you want of sensing it's its own Universe it's its own thing has its own flaws and ways that it presents itself or ways Vibes something okay see I'm thinking, if you just do your upgrade of one by the two by the three by the four by and you happen to bump into a sensing world it's so different and you weren't giv a heads up I'm trying to give you a heads, up I'm trying to give you a heads up on it uh it may really bump you because the Hidden World we already know from some people uh the, power of it I would say the more aliveness of it but some people say whoa It's really strong it's really powerful that it's a bigger size okay compared to what I was experiencing in the Manifest is a sense of in increment of size H could be much brighter something in texture changes it could be a new quality that it will make up you as a character there that's where Steve for example talks about The Golden Boy there see when he starts to play around in this sensing realm just making an approach he starts to get this Golden Boy thing okay and we'll see who the character so I'm on them to yeah but eventually tell me Golden Boy what okay be a fuller character uh so yeah that's the quality it's golden for him here's a be a different color a different quality whatever okay so that's just an example if I use me as an example I'm just using me as an example I didn't like I did with the monster I don't expect you all to be uh that's me in the earlier stages I like him I like that but you could be more beautiful you could be more caring you could be more Medical insightful you're, you okay so, careful of, I got to roar like sensor RS or I won't make it to Heaven crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] okay [Music], yeah see remember a lot of teachers don't know this and they sort of settle in open and they experience certain things and they feel better yeah one by do two by example I feel better as a two tuai and what they feel as a tuai is say oh you ought to feel it the way that I feel it because they think oh that's the only thing I feel fresher you ought to feel fresher maybe you don't feel fresher maybe you feel stronger maybe you feel more caring maybe you feel and you're right that's you in your world so we're not duplicates of each other that way we're individuals I'm on my not lineage here for a bit so I get into finer levels of whatever that is lineage and you're on yours okay the basic structure and how things work I'd like you to catch on to okay so it doesn't matter if you're a musician a one by to a two by can't hurt in the in the beginning okay if you're a bodybuilder a one by to a two by can hurt Amy I think we tried to present that with the kettle bells uh that if you aren't in the next level with a sense of deeper you don't have the support coming up to lift that much weight or move them or what whatever so it doesn't matter what your lineage is musician bodybuilder fighter lover healer whatever a one by two a two by two by two a three by is pretty cool okay but who'll be there will be you on your lineage this kind of Basics are we okay here H Okay so again play with sensing wherever you're starting from manifest world of figure but continue to play it and play it uh sense of more, room of it or finer level of it without getting caught up in the walls of a two by and then ah great oh there and now the walls of a three by we're not we're not playing with sensing we're not overt ly stuck in that one by two by three by with those uh what do we call membranes we're sensing through all of that the words are a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we're going to have to create a language here did I lose you any place yeah who what that's funny that's great who's talking to who I don't think anybody's talking actually sense Tom, had his mic open oh sorry I had my I loved your creting a new language so I'm I just smiling I'm sorry I didn't mean I, had my mic off wonderful thank you okay I'll be [Laughter], quiet uh okay uh again never know if I'm losing somebody or if there only going blank feel free to tell me or have a question, okay see I'd go talk to and say when I had a question okay on my process, okay a lot of people most people didn't nobody did trying to be truthful to you uh people didn't clamor to be at o sensei's door to dialogue with him that, wasn't, done I'm a foreigner and we hit it off the first time I asked him something and he gave me free, access uh and I'd wonder why other people weren't there even when he gave a special lecture it's not like there were droves of students there they were small groups and I thought holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what's with that I don't know he was too much for them too advanced for them, whatever so blah, sideline okay sensing, sensing I I'm afraid that in moving from the Manifest world if suddenly whatever the world of sensing is there because of the size the power the little change of qualities that's there whatever, might throw you might bump you okay might confuse you to the point where you say I don't understand screw it I'm out of here and go back to year 3x3 or what, what whatever okay so I'm thinking playing the game of sensing doing the best you can experiential sensing and, just playing there experi, sensing maybe check what's what are you sensing about I don't know easy and finer level of sensing and just continue that just play around okay then when trying to say if when the full world of sensing that's right here shows it's, there potentially because you're already warmed up to it, doesn't the bump isn't really a major bump it's like oh there's something different here whoa It's bigger whoa It's stronger that, you won't get bumped away bumped out of it okay I said to Brad I said I had this dumb idea what do you what do you think about it I said it's like you're going into your swimming pool which is a bit cold but if your body is wet is it true that going into the your cold pool is not as not as a harsh it's not as scary because you're wet, already and he thought that would work I'm checking you that does that work for you is that s give you the flavor I'm talking about fun around with sensing easy sensing, easy sensing easy okay see where it brings you so that when we actually hit the Fuller world of sensing the, shock there won't quite might be a shock okay you won't get bumped, okay up to this point where the hell are we are you following Sensei Chris here again from New Zealand um along our journey we've talked about um different dimensions sort of leaking back and sort of getting glimpses of that would be along the similar path as the sensing like you'd be in a certain place and it'd be a sense at Sonic house would be a bit bigger than where you are sort of leaking into that space and you're um what am I trying to so yeah I'm trying to get the words right sorry um and Chris, Chris you can't talk in your normal New Zealand voice for me right you have to clip it a bit for me if you speak normal New Zealand whatever one G [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] DEA anyway so but that will help me so I guess the question is um some of that higher sensing um the potential for it to leak from that higher space down to where you are wherever you are wait, did you say, higher yeah well you know I mean I don't know what you mean you mean higher Heaven is up there when I'm saying it's here yeah no I got to make a correction people I'm sorry but once you continue with that you're going to be mindful about that and this whole under half is going to be left out and we can't continue that that's an ancient problem it goes on and on throughout all the levels, unfortunately so correction made Contin um so from The Next Level some of that I don't want to say higher now the next level sensing coming back to you so in the one you're in it scenario you're in it yeah you're in a sense you're in that level of a sensing space yeah I come back to me I might sound like I'm, holding Chris kind of tightly here you know this it's again me, well I guess it's you're in that space to some degree of feeling I felt them hit me there was a little okay then I continue easy finer easy finer feeling okay I don't know when I move but I maybe when his fingers weren't touching that was a little slower he glommed in a bit more there, I to pick him up a little bit earlier going from feeling to finer feeling to sense feeling right I'm here at that level all of me my, my whole everything is at that level of level of sensing okay or at least a sense feeling let's call it because it's not a pure sensing yet but sense feeling and then I continue finer sense feeling later on it be I feel his back I'm just making that up because I'm not at that level right now but his back is coming in sensing I can I, can sense that he's coming around that's why he was able to move him that way I felt a little bit of a circle in his system felt I S Felt he's straighter, he was straighter so although he, moved because he was on TV his energy is really a little straighter get out of here anyway something yeah, okay ah okay so people I'm trying to give you a heads up that the sensing world is there and that if we play with that word and experience at whatever degree just continue with it that it will assist in our transition into being a fuller citizen of the sensing world okay see I mentioned I think uh the 1935 iido film he go sense it was more fully in the sensing world and that started to get kind of magical okay uh he continued past that but that film is right about sensing World for, him so we're where am I going with that forgot why I got on to that oh that he was active he was present sensing world was there for him so it's an active alive thing it's not just an A belief they'll run your ass over for on the M, okay sense experience they start to move he's already moving okay it wasn't oh let's say I see him moving and, oh he's moving that way and I'm going to move this way there's none of that by this stage of that game at that level 1935 era zo don't know how to word it but it's like when movement came in he was moved equally something like that but enough let's not get locked in on iO techniques and stuff so people where are we what do I need to say here what do I need to clarify okay who Ms let's say this is a map this manifest world and I'm using right now the 1 by two by 3 by Bobby Rober not whatever as a lineage heavier, to finer and finer and finer okay and now I'm saying but after a bit good enough good enough we can make this shift from this page one page one to the page that's right there underneath it like a medical book okay couple Pages there's the human body there's the skeletal there's the whatever I love that I always had to love that medical book presentation okay so same, thing here so this page is basic physical that can get finer and finer and finer and finer okay but after a while enough okay and certainly some of you are getting bored okay with finer and finer and finer you want to cut to the chase maybe okay again not mentally but yes s sense, and after a bit sensing to the whole world of sensing that should be available for us we're getting more into o sensei's speed and again watch out for Speed meaning oh I can think my way that there I'm there no you're not you're making it up [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'll punch you out just to show you you're not there, okay but you can experiential move fast okay so this next World of sensing is right here in the overlay pattern easy so I'm saying yeah you guys been around long, enough you can begin to in most cases is back off from uh checking your 4x4 and then your 5x five you, got the sense of it if one by the two by the three by is pretty whatever and you feel kind of balanced or whatever sure good enough now again starting as a human easy sensing okay now right there's not much for me sensing easy sensing again I heard yes finer feeling sensing and now it's half and half I can sort of feel this but I sense something around that bigger than, that so, I'm sort of in a half, world I'm feeling to manifest I'm getting a little taste of sensing there's something, going around I can't quite put my finger on and I just continue till more sensing more sensing more sensing and again it'll happen that the Fuller of the sensing world is here zo you can become a citizen of that world okay where are we where are we did you follow that okay did I say it okay come help me out here you're allowed to is talking now yes I um it makes it and it's, balanced you know I getting a an inner and an outer experience of sensing that there's as, much on the inner plane of my being as there is on the outer and, and it's like a u I'm experiencing as a sort of U oh like a breath breathing in a breathing out the sensing is, um it's becoming more fluid and I, feel like I can move now I can I can stretch out in the space you can be I'm trying to understand how you're laying this out of ver you can be in a sensing World apparently and still be present in the physical world, yes, uh that yes it is inner traveling to get there but then once you're there it's here yes they can be in a sensing world and be aware oh those are other human beings, or whatever you don't lose the world yes yeah yes yeah yes but you don't to get pushed into dealing with the world BK, like world people deal with each other yeah and again there's those sensates fully in this uh hidden level and he's dealing with all these people and things are naturally happening okay wasn't just a belief dear God protect me okay he cut on as a little kid that, wouldn't work okay I mentioned that story quite a while back another time and go over yeah Tom you weren't finished yes that yes that was the, the essence of, my experience with this yes thank you for the followup for that thank you I've been realizing more and more that trying to get to a sensing world has been all virtually I've ever done as a done as a teacher I think back of all the early practices back in the Noah teenager years and that's what we were playing with you know Bob if I forget remind me uh we feel them grab okay easy finer feeling and you pick it up little earlier easy finer feeling then we say turn your back, or we'd blindfold you CU we're getting to a level that's feeling sensing or sense feeling and as they were reaching without making any noise no stomping on the ground no heavy breathing nothing like that you got very good you were a teenage Prodigy here uh of he's coming in now and you're timing was Christine you know he's starting to reach from over there and you're saying yes here he coming so we're doing finer, finer to sensing and I did so many different practices different things you know what do you see okay I see the physical thing well of course you do he picked up his right foot and he stepped now what are you seeing meaning finer settle, what are you seeing and after a bit they say oh I see some energy before he picks his foot up in steps okay great easy settle open finer, seeing what do you see and depending on the person they were able to say oh I saw this whoosh of energy behind them and then they moved in stuff like that I did hundreds of different dumb practices, working my way through finer to sensing okay we touch a piece of wood because I had benches and in those days around the dojo uh and I'd say to my uh it's my daytime women's class okay what do you feel and they tell me the obvious what they felt and then we play some kind of easy settle whatever words I was using in those days and touch against now finer feeling what do you feel and there'd be a different level of feeling and I forget what right now okay and then after a bit finer, to more sense feeling and again don't remember the exact details but stuff would come up like they're, feeling the tree that eventually became a wooden bench they're sensing past its heavier presentation into its background it's it as itself its, history say with stuff like that so we did all kinds of games but if you just look at them all the same thing trying to move from a heavier feeling to a finer to a sense feeling and, as I continue with this work at this level I like oh my God and those practices were based on this and all those practices over there were based on this I've I been heading this way, yeah Bob historically you got anything to add to that whatever that meant Sensei I think you might have even used the word the word sensing at the time even though the way you're using it now of course is much deeper and more sophisticated but even at the time I think you may have used the word sensing to say there's more I had to use something didn't I yeah yes you'd say there's more than the physical and what is it and then that sensing process as you now explain it was occurring when we did dumb things like put the arm out with this energy flow practice kind of simple basic right energy flow and it'd be like what do you feel what you feel capable of but then after a bit finer and finer uh it change it a bit uh it's not an arm anymore what is it now we're starting to shift from feeling to finer sensing feeling that was an example yeah yes that's a even if we go back to the arm thing where you know people would call it the unbendable arm but you didn't call it that hated that phrase yeah soon as you say unbendable some monster comes out of the audience and bends your arm right besides that it Li it limits you to the Manifest you called it an energy arm and you had various names for it but you never called it the unv arm because of what you just partly what you just said but also you're not sensing that yeah also at the level we were at oh same say he could probably say that and back it up right we seen him do other things didn't do that particular one that I saw but other things akin to it at the level he was at yes he could say unbendable or you can't defeat me and at the level he was at that's a fact okay because the level he was at the energies were so balanced that if this happened this was happening he didn't have to say oh here comes that I better jump over here there was there was some level of being present partaking of that where whoosh, whoosh whoh whoo whoh whoo just a natural happening s it often say to me I don't do, anything except be at that level be in that, world and a lot of it takes care of itself right yeah then he gets fancier he gets more to the Divine he says as soon as you think about attacking me you're already defeated it gets even faster and Fuller we don't even need a movement from UK as soon as UK says I can get this old man that's when you go what are you doing why are you thinking that way where are we people am I losing you any, here two maps is cool hi spark me you totally understood all of this Sensei tesia here tiia there all right so uh I appreciated actually that you called this evening's program the, sensing highway what an unusual title and because we in moving into sensing that process that you often talk about from, concept or from idea into, feeling and deeper feeling into the world of sensing that's a that's a process that's a way that's kind of the way that we move so it might start with the head and with the idea for a moment yes of course it's okay for a moment understood no, argument here I was yelling at all of them so that, intention moves uh and it I think that it does need a little bit of that feeling because the feeling begins to move out of the conceptual out of the ideation The Experience yeah experiential sensing yes beautiful, so the, interesting thing for me is to think of this and in the way that we're languaging about it right now, we're kind of working a little bit with language is sensing is direct experience is direct knowing uh so we think about knowing as being conceptual but the direct part is sensing yeah so it's a kind of sensing, yeah so it's a kind of sensing is a kind of knowing but does not rely on concept it does not rely on the kind of experiential sensing which has no this even though that's not its major that way that's this one's major yeah, that's right this one is lacking a bit it can have a let's say on the mat a physical body that's where a lot of people when they say to mind too mind to mind say what they got a body and they wiggle it around yes you got a body yes there's a body there and in some cases the more mental people can have a very good body it could be semi-pros you know sure but that doesn't mean they've got this whole underworld of the major of sensing, experience that yeah so that's what we're talking about here yeah we're, talking about here yeah we're talking about that space of flow we sometimes use that term flow is being in that direct knowing or that direct experience for instance I, think you and I may have talked about this before in a good in a good randori to go back to Iko for a moment in a good randori when you're watching that and we're watching somebody that's in the flow you can see they're, not thinking about it but if they stop at any particular moment and start to strategize about what they're going to do with the next guy then they're then they're out then they kind of get it's a mes bumped out it's get bumped out of that uh that beautiful direct knowing as level they were at yeah yes yeah, anyway good I think that's for me that's always been a good example because our iido does provide the opportunity for that sensing direct knowing if we if I could jump in for just a second since I with the example of randori it reminds me that we earlier had a question two questions about feeling hectic and under time pressure not enough time and I think we've observed we've all observed, experienced that in the flow of randori there is enough time and when you step out of the flow all of a sudden you're pressed at that level and we could use space I use space with Dusty at that level in that size space you're not crowded yeah we triy to show this from the, GetGo, boom okay and I don't have any time goe oh, and the new people will do that for 50 times in a row, oh now do we teach them how to do a technique not really not me easy settle oh easy settle more oh, yeah, I didn't teach him a technique I just said man at the level you're at ain't no way you know if anything you're going to get more hectic you know you know when they when they jump and attack you God damn it when they jump and attack the attacker uh no we don't want to go that way so from the GetGo I tried to lay that out you know settle and look at how much time you have look how much more room there is if you settle into that whatever you want to call it dimensional level the more space of that dimensional level then all these things about being crowded and it don't seem to exist there go back to a very simple, practice I was thinking about going over that one tomorrow it's interesting in kind of in the deeper levels to, go back to what Lauren wonderfully observed is that it's there he was saying there's, plenty of time and in away in the Flow State and I'm not just talking about randori I'm talking about you know for me like sometimes musical performance it's without time there's no real time, in the way that we think about the sequence of things it's just presence it's so that infers you're at a better if you to manifest a better dimensional level yeah and you get a clue about o sense saying where I stand there is no space nor time before and you say yes yeah, there's something there how do you know because you went from ah to more to the level you're talking about so he says that not a spark your interest because you've had experience all along the way unless you've been so dumb you didn't notice what was happening as if it's news to you, didn't notice what we were doing with the Kata hit he didn't notice that at a certain level of playing time is different, yeah so when someone throws out the a very Grand level of time no space whatever it's like H really don't know how to do it yet but it sounds feasible huh, maybe I'll ask This Old Man how he gets there because that attracted my attention this time difference okay yeah sense say in my experience in, my practice on the mat and in my business practice there is this immediate recoil sometimes that and I recognize it but on top of that there's this immediate reaction to do, something quickly to rush to a response to not take time to absorb what energy is coming is coming in when I when I best re especially in business in a conflict when I best respond it's the next day or the next two or three days or even the next week when I've had a chance to let it settle let it simmer let it cook for a while then I come up with what is a better more balanced response and the same on that too it's uh, that's, my error to rush to yeah to do something let's stay with the it Rush yeah something happens and it's already mixing right yeah but we don't quite enough practice with it uh so you can't maybe, instantly since it' be instantly but uh of opening its mixing and proper response, person at first it's just mixing and it's glowing a bit and bumps you out you know why you bothering me with that problem that's not my business that's a contractor over there you know whatever, whatever yeah but taking a day you're just doing the same thing but in a, slower Fuller form yeah so that the mix character that's there at that level responds better yeah I caught this uh pre or back in the workshop days people would call me sometimes come do a workshop in a different state or whatever and I knew if they caught me off that I'd have a Nega I don't want to you know so I learned a little trick for me at that time was uh listen to what they had to say and then say can I call you back tomorrow or in a couple of hours I just make a time thing there and then I deal with this extra surge of energy and the energy mix and, and, if it felt okay I would normally accept the workshop, offer you know out of 10 or 20 or more maybe there was one that didn't feel right I turned it down but it just felt queasy but all the others I, took but I like that trick of let me call you back whether it was an hour or tomorrow whatever we're at time to get okay with my energies and be okay with teaching a workshop there in that manner to those kinds of people so yeah same, yeah mute, Tom it is the same and uh it's very much the same and I um and as a practice even during the day thoughts, will rise up you know why is that guy speeding on the freeway in front of me why is did he cut why did he cut me off why am I even worried about that why am I reacting to that why am I and it, you know I don't Guilt Trip myself for having negative thoughts or whatever because they pass and I recognize they pass I'm human so we're going to have these thoughts we're going to have these, thoughts we're going to have these responses I think you've always said over on Mission Street we at the dojo if you see two people fighting across the street they're, across the street, they're, across the street they're fighting but somehow Energy starts to form you look at that and you go huh I'm connected I'm connecting with that energy right now and this whole process starts to happen so we learn and we go back to somebody swerving in front of the guy in front of you where you get a bit of a rush because apparently things we can see touch us yeah, but then the realization of the rush you got isn't a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about him because he got nothing to do with you he's already over there and in the next Lane over heading down the highway whatever but you got to there deal with your own energies and, and whatever to get to the truer sense of them whatever the words are now yeah we can't finish with this with that stupid ass hole yeah I don't think that's healthy boom so that'll happen more readily that will get faster at sensing Susan you're on right she's here Sensei I can't quite hear her can you hear can you hear me we cannot hear her well okay I'll talk for her uh she's using these sensing levels to do her work with patients and doing very well we're having a ball with that uh learning a lot with that um she doesn't have time to be a sensing seer, uh a sensing healer whatever to spend an hour just getting present and looking at the patient and getting present and looking at, a pure physical level uh she's virtually got a start now easy sensing level and then may maybe finer and finer but boom she has to start there we don't have time in the medical community with a patient who's got an hour scheduled with you to do nothing for half an hour so, it should get faster getting faster with her she starting to sense even with people who aren't patients or just in her vicinity she's starting to sense something much deeper about them yeah so her normal state is becoming more of a sensing level normally which should be so okay did I say that right, yeah so she doesn't have to go I'm going to do some magic Now give me a while to settle and I'm going to sense easy ah finer sensing uh we'd have to do that after a bit Yeah a moment a moment yes, yes but sensing and finer sensing and continue it and we'll see if the sensing world doesn't show more full bore and hopefully because you've had a lot of presence in this warm up of sensing that it doesn't shock you or bump you or confuse you too much okay that's another main thing that I wanted to get across uh that it's closer smoother potentially faster don't, jump on that word uh but it is faster and it should facilitate you becoming a citizen of the sensing world where there's God knows unlimited okay whether you're musican or a Healer or what the hell ever a martial artist unlimited possibilities here okay give my notes but I think that's, that's about what I wanted to lay out Sensei your title today was the sensing Highway yeah your choice of Highway as a word here in the title Easy Flow straight away we don't have to stop unless you're an old man with bladder problems so maybe we'll talk to somebody else there but uh at every gas station or every bush along the way that this get really fluid that's what I'm trying to say sensing, sensing and there you are and there, is there is Susan a minute and she's starting to get the sensing level and seeing things doesn't take her an yeah, because you're not stuck by the walls of 1 by one and 2 by two and 3X, by3 we're not really using those anymore although we may be aware of them but we're not stuck in the structure of them you're stuck in the structure of them when you're heavy in the Manifest, okay but in the sensing it's more fluid it's, so if you can get there and get a flavor for it then from the beginning it's easy it's fluid yeah see I teach the slower earlier form historically feel your hand easy settle a bit now what's before the hand oh my wrist oh cool easy settle now tell me about your arm oh the forearm is really coming in strong here oh forearm wrist hand oh on and on and on now we get to a sensing arm or an arm that sense gee it's not an arm anymore it's it feels like an energy flow out there, whoa okay now ensei didn't have to go through all those steps to be ensei on the map the map this was boom there he was e or whatever okay I, lay out the, step out of time patterns historically because that's where you were at most people were in there one by one or Worse, okay so we laid out a step-by-step process that could be experienced so then later we can pick up the pace they used to call it the checkerboard game at first the game is one sare Square One move next Square One move next Square One move next Square One move that's the game you're in then they King you at the end of it from that moment on I call it the checkerboard game you understand why can you hear me do you feel me and important it's not just an intellectual it's got to be some experiential in there okay very important I'll keep mentioning it so when I say sensing I'll throw in experiential sensing okay experiential sensing and the experiential sensor has knowledge about that'll be there but if you just go for the knowledge there's a tendency of majoring in the awareness and you're missing a main part okay a problem we've had from the beginning it's still here and it carries into other levels unfortunately see there's a reason o Sensei passed on he said I could have taught the normal spiritual level stuff but there's already a lot of guys doing that you know he brought in the body and functionality and deeper ground okay with the sense of more experiential because that half historically has been, lost there's a lot of awarenesses a lot of spiritual awarenesses and yeah you can see finer levels and stuff uh but there's something about not having a character a body boom there's something that's not there that will be critical as we get into the Divine if you make it that far okay it'll be uh and anyway blah, I think, enough it trusts me on that experiential see when you say yes since I understand we're talking about some physical presence so yes since I understand and I feel not one iota of change in the body I say damn one of those they're aware they're intelligent but I understand well let me feel it if you understand it should be a glow a something a little change something that naturally, happens I understand and can do I don't know what to say here the creative language, okay te you in the folks you oh my God we eat have time in the folks that you deal with some similar problem of course I'm sure you want to say anything here try to clarify what I was trying to lay out um sure in working with folks with meditation, say the uh one of the challenges of course is you go into you go into different states of, uh Consciousness and often people will drop into that um a, very settled and calm State then they don't want to leave that they're, they become satisfied with and for some people like that's plenty don't, bug me let, me jump in for a moment especially if they started with I'm so nervous I got to do something gee I have a feeling I should take a meditation so as soon as I hit calmness they're happy yeah they're happy at that, point was their goal right yeah it was their goal and so there's no sense of further uh exploration uh and, if you bother them too much about it there I'm out I've got I've got what I want I've got leave me alone I call that historically level of comfortableness yeah it is, a it is and if they if your student really says I'm comfortable here sort of into a sense of back off Sensei usually I'll back off I'll let him do whatever [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's doing in the corner of the mat there okay because he doesn't want to be nudged he doesn't, want to be nudged he doesn't want to be reminded yeah the that's again one of those ongoing problems where in even doing a one to a two or two by to a three by where you can get Superior okay and you enjoy being you're, the top guy in the neighborhood okay you're the big fish, in a little Pond though you know yes there we go yeah the frog in the Little Pond whatever yeah uh and they're happy with it and just say move on when here they get afraid one reason is that they'll lose their prominence like they don't quite caught on that a Robert is better than a Bobby and a n is better than a Robert and a Sensei is better than a n kind of thing they haven't quite caught that and they're very afraid of Letting Go and that's another reason that the sequencing of the ways that we often practice working with one by two by3 by so, to speak or the deeper settling and then eventually in that easy the eye because inside the deeper sensing the direct knowing is not an eye space is not um I'm, realiz I realize this you know that's, too much that's too much time between thinking and being and the sensing is more and if and if somebody says to you well if I can understand what you're talking about I got it yeah, I, got nothing to say to you people I'm sorry I, I can't talk that way yeah tell me all about it so I know about it and then I'll make believe that I'm there well when it comes down to meditation and, what you're teaching people are, actually afraid of transformation oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know maybe we should have retitled the book something else but that no I think it's I think it's I think it's great the but, people will bump into their own fears about genuinely changing because when, you're in the in the space of transformation you're talking about genuine change there's a real change in character there's a real change in the depth of your of your perception of your being one of my first yeah funny obvious ones teaching in the early very early iido in Mountain View and uh added little meditation class and one student I guy and I said oh you haven't been coming to the meditation classes and he said no and then I don't know why uh his idea was if you meditate you can't have sex and he was happily married and I thought what the hell look at me you know world yeah it's okay but his was so he's not going to get into meditation because as if all of his sex drive would be gone said ain't no way if you're sexy baby you're sexy and he continues but he really amused me that guy poor guyh anyway never got into medit meditation people I think we ate up our time uh I sort of covered the main points the practice even though we're at first still in a manifest world but, even getting into the sensing as sort of a, major even that's rewarding and when the Fuller of the underlying map the next map shows that it's there H you won't be bumped or startled it should be an easier transition my first talk to Sensei about this he sort of inferred a bump that's how I heard it then later when I was getting this sense of, of that sensing, and sensing World sensing Universe uh he said yes uh it, doesn't how do you word it doesn't have to be a bump it could be but there's no reason for it to be but I'm thinking if you if you're not don't have a little bit of a heads up on it, could be a bump and I hate to see you run scared or get confused and, not hang out till it clarified itself uh when it's okay it's okay yeah so I hope I got that point across anyway that's it for me any last things

is that right we, go uh 6:30 to 7:30 uh sometimes after 7:30 jump in I want to talk to you for a couple minutes okay, sounds good thank you okay where are we uh the history in retrospect I've been at this for God a long time some of our earlier practices and I'm going back 55 years here okay for example we would do personal work okay here their hands and I'm feeling the hands and they feel a little heavy and they're a little cold and I don't feel like I have too much exterity uh you shouldn't hand me a scalpel now to do any kind of cutting work I'm not there and then easy settle personal work ah hands in a finer World hands I'm noticing some pulsations or tingling uh some energy movement I, call that the way it's pulsing and tingling starting to Glow a little bit I think easy set the sense of moving into a finer level okay of easy hands here they feel longer than my, physical stops here but the hands I have out here feel like they're longer they feel like they sort of want to reach out and activate hold things catch things throw things I don't they want to activate a bit so we would start with something like that and then I would uh bring them finer and finer we probably end up with something like in those days something, like in those days something like okay don't look at them anymore because your eyes will see the more tangible we've already covered the tangible few levels we usually end up with something like okay they used to be hands but at this level a finer feeling what are they for me right now A distinct a two flows they are two flows and of course my attention gets drawn back to my physical pains because my body is such a wreck but I yeah that's that that's the heavier now back to this level of finer feeling the flow level and easy yeah there's some aliveness the way they're glowing if you were to start talking right here about the Poss ability of laying hands on people and, helping them get better whatever it'd be like oh yeah, I can I can feel the aliveness in the hand that's beginning to make sense to me yeah so that was one oldtime practice all I was doing was getting the people to shift from the heavier into easy the finer feeling and from there easy the finer feeling so again just a work my own body I didn't have to go out into the Great Space uh just here just here in this area here was good enough my uh concentric circle pattern was internal finer to finer to finer okay so that's why I sort of didn't like the big diagrams that way that's, a different discussion okay inner finer so that was on the old practices uh we used to do a lot of partner sitting uh where I'd have my hands uh don't think we have to show you Brad I don't think I'll need you here uh and somebody would sit here and we found that the right was more a positive flow and the left uh reverse uh the left received that positive flow and the right would continue to go out so there start to be a circuit now at first you would just feel the tangibles uh their skin texture do they have calluses whatever, is right there obvious feeling and their body warms pretty quick right there obvious feeling then we continue this pattern of Easy A little finer sensing okay so we're moving, inner to a finer level okay uh what some of the things I won't follow a particular order because I don't remember the exact order now again 55 years ago uh okay the first there'd be that your tingling energy level and you notice they had a tingling energy level that you could feel okay easy that would continue and then you begin to realize currents are coming from them through you back out to them so starting to create a circuit okay and in those days it was always the right seemed more positive the left was more receptive that's why we did it that way okay and there start to be this current going through that both could, begin to sense no not sense yet feel at a finer level, okay if we continue what would we get into, uh maybe begin to finer feel, them not just as energy currents going through their body but as if more and more of their whole body was sort of like an energy field and there'd be more of a, sharing or relationship with that energy field okay you're really with the person you're starting to in, energy terms be inside of them and they were inside of you kind of thing so anyway we, do that with Partners a lot and we could also give each other feedback oh I think it's coming in here and going out there and, if they said yes, I'm feeling that too get a little confirmation which is kind of fun in the early stages okay games and then I tried to show some of that on the mat now I'll borrow you uh but not sitting standing thing I, think I started off in the old days with uh, the first heavy grasp oh okay I'd be stunned well what just happened okay making a little joke there if you're really heavy that's what happened okay as you easy you feel and right here at this level of finer feeling I felt a little Direction so I felt this direction go on so at that level is easy to begin to blend with him okay easy finer feeling and I think was a hair sooner you can take your time there so they can see there it comes there it is okay so I don't let him glom on I'm already feeling that so I've laid that kind of stuff out in iido just as a beginning kind of practice to settle down and open up using this finer feeling finer feeling to get to a sensing world that that's hair and very important along the you anybody remember history here no you around then and we did a lot of this in Mountain View Dojo yes we did Sensei anything that I forgot to mention that finer feeling sense of the energy field got more and more pronounced and it began to experience things about the other person that came with that finer experience of the energy field okay yeah uh let's see okay at Elin used to have people uh let's say at the beginning of the workshop I'd like to thr this one at them right have them sit with a stranger and just again settle feeling easy finer feeling and what would happen the way I set it up with them was they could begin to feel the I don't know let's call it qualities if their partner was a jokester they could feel the humor if their partner was a philosopher type they could feel that okay and then I'd have them uh again they don't know these people this is brand new they all strangers to each other okay I'd have them go out for a long walk and have a normal conversation but see if they're I won't say sense here but if the, finer feeling they had about them was verified was the jokester a funny guy was the philosopher definitely obviously a philosopher the way his conversations would go okay so they get some practice realize they had a certain level of ability that came really fast and verification on it yeah so I did quite a few of these things at the SN workshops I used to head them in Fairly deep past finer physical feeling I'd set it up with both of you be more open with the sense that you're opening so you're partner can sort of pass through and, feel the truer you making up a word here the truer you not this you that you're this thing you're putting on to cope with the world but the truer you kind of thing the inner truth of you okay and both, of them would open up to allow the other one to sort of pass through touch more of their core who use that word there that who are you really core and what would happen one thing was they could actually feel as they moved into their system they could feel a movement coming from that system into their system they could actually feel the, breeze energy Breeze that was there so that I showed up funny story there knew they were coming along pretty good we, Chang Partners there so you get some variety uh again help verify you weren't just making up stories uh because they're so different uh three people sat with this guy there's no conversation and the three people didn't converse with each other about this guy okay it was a silent sitting and soon as we were finished with that piece we change Partners had no discussions about anything we change partners and do the same thing with a different partner well the three Partners in a row all experience the interior of this guy bear with me on the words they all saw a white, stallion no he wasn't wearing a Cowboys belt buckle right he wasn't wearing a t-shirt with a horse thing on it, just they just all saw a white stallion now in those days I didn't want to continue finer and finer to interpret that or have that explain itself but it just interesting that three different people sitting with this guy all finer and finer and finer in to this guy all saw the same thing all experienced the same thing I thought that was fun they had fun with that are you following anything I'm saying here absolutely Susan are you on a clear Zone She's Not Susan damn the Hills okay I was going to have her if she remembered yes I am here sorry were you sleeping did I wake you I had technical difficulties I was stopping so you wouldn't have to hear road noise this time okay slow it down a bit your voice carries slow it down um did you follow what I was saying did you hear what I was saying yeah yes I did okay and I have a question would you say that you were working with um selves at that time uh 55 years ago I don't think that word was in my repertoire although I may have been myself fting around there but why should that come, up we're just doing Simple finer feeling level uhuh I don't need a self per se to do finer feeling per do I okay don't lead us astray Susan never talk to you later uh what I was going to ask was do you remember can you go through quickly your stages going from a normal physical therapist body manipulator let's call you okay finder feeling and continuing that can you go through that quick as best as you can recall your history through those stages my so starting with training with you and developing a sense of finer energy feelings finer feeling of H your feeling of whatever levels of energy okay your work change then is what you're saying yes okay give us some examples first you're just a physical manipulator you're basic Physical Therapy what you learned in school boom you're good at it but it's a but it's a level now you catch on the finer feeling and you're touching those same types of bodies now at finer feeling well I brought up the story last session of appreciating how much more information was available about the system, um with really just a light Touch compared to you know the more complex detailed, physical manipulation evaluation that I was taught to do so that, information was readily available which is simply yeah a light touch yeah, so you could feel that information you could experience that information could, experience that information could I say yes yeah and I brought that up because I want people not to think this is just an idea and because you're smart you're going to stick your idea in this and no don't go there sensing, experientially, sensing and in an experience of got the word of sensing in that this experience that we're going through uh the experience of a finer Dimension and then you know more there's more intelligence right there with that experience okay so we need the experience, yeah people you got what I that's only that's only available to me if I settle deeply and open yeah and she's referring to a sense of feeling it experiencing it yes, okay see I'm trying to make a distinction over and over and over again because it's an ancient problem of oh I understand I got it no you ain't got it you got the library of it but there hasn't been any funing around and there's no gymnasium character defer feeling healer or whatever okay and you got to get clear on that difference otherwise I'll and moan about it forever because it's ancient and I'd like to sort of start to knock it off a bit if possible okay experience feel the feeling can't say it any better and Susan you're moving along moving into what level of finer feeling well certainly a Next Level if I'm working with a child and his or her family would be experiencing feeling much more of the Dynamics um between the child and his family okay you made a big jump there so uh that was a big jump no, problem I just wanted to keep it on a dot, dot, like I did with the hands you, know or oh, my hands feel warmer oh my God I think there's a current coming and going, oh your current is touching my current I think we're sharing currents I just wanted to go click, click, you did a big step for them and I don't know if I'm ready for it or if they're ready for, it is that okay with my apologies yeah, and you apparently can't simplify for me so should we move on yes I think well partly because I was working with kids and families all day to so that's that actually is very much a, next yes but see I didn't want the next, next I didn't want a past life appearance knowing why the kid is kind of screwed up this life I want to go there it's too far it's too much is, Elaine on tonight I'm sorry El Ela no, sense she's she could probably explain a next very, nicely well she has to be on to do so, anyway uh but this is good basic this a feeling finer feeling finer feeling so let stop there and dialogue for, for a bit I didn't lose you on that did I Mike from New Zealand can you hear me um yes I remember in some of the much earlier visits little slower a little slower to New Zealand Zealander blur for us all right and um you were doing uh basic too exercise but at the end of the or the end of the movement you were then maintaining the contact and walking UK around and the words you were using were because you're Gathering more information through the connection about what's going to naturally flow next yeah involved in a situation you can continue this what we call it movement into finer to continue to pick up even more information yeah, and, funny because I'd also leared that from my Kung Fu teacher years before that you want to have as much contact as you can with your other party for as long as you can because you gather information and that you know in, the in the case of what we're doing here now that um that develops a better relationship between you and your partner because you have more information watch out for very, short Eng short Eng ments yes kind of flavor not that you can't hit on with somebody really click but jump the gun too fast there's a lot of information you don't have yeah you miss yes and could come back and bite you in the butt we say yeah, thank you thank you okay so kind of Basics here I think say something help me out here people uh Sensei Bob, here yeah one of the things that used to happen in the partner practice you were describing that I think is pretty basic is you would start to feel that energy circulation and if the other person had a block in someplace in their system you could start to feel the energy moving toward that block and on a good day the block would clear up and then the, flow would be more complete yeah if they opened up there and stuff but you could feel if they had a blockage because the energies would go ging and then maybe but they weren't really kind of hear, and slow it things down yeah so it say to somebody what we say things like uh oh you got to loosen up your hip a little bit or something cuz it was being held too taut right yes that's right yeah, Jesus Sensei this is Justin I hi uh similar thing happens in um in the center when working with clients for example if, I'm if I'm settling an opening with them they, start to settle an open two in response and then they'll, remember or recall or Express things that at first didn't seem at all related to the reason that they came in much like I'm sure Susan experiences with her clients and they'll realize that there's, something deeper going on it wasn't on the, surface that comes up because we, resonate with each other and when one of us is settling in opening the other part if they're available for it and not blocking it per se goes through a similar process yeah to yeah that's why I tell the therapist types if they were more what words you use there open that because of this mirroring mimicking effect on each other that's possibly there that you're saying yeah uh that it's easier for them with their therapist to lay out the real problems CU in the heavy they just want to tell them some whatever kind of normal but the real problem is being held in if the therapist isn't open enough he may not catch that he may not know how to be more open so they can naturally sort of mimic him what whatever word we need there a mirroring or something uh for this to happen yeah, uh Susan has had the same experiences Susan you want to jump in on that piece right there yeah that's a really good point uh Justin and um what to say I think it is remarkable how much um people are able to open up and settle if I as a therapist if you part to open and settle yes and Susan often calls me I with the same kind of at first little story here uh where the child came in very protective and whatever and whatever she lines up the sense of her being settle and open the child is affected by that and the next week when they come in they're coming in more open they're happy to see her where's the first visit they were on kind of thing so I hear this from Susan all the all the time yeah it's not just opening for that moment but in a lot of cases they, retain that and she sees a difference from one week to the next in some cases just because they're more open their systems can flow better more harmonious whatever, yeah Susan you want to add anything there yeah, it's actually quite REM just beautiful sometimes how immediate the connection is when they come back and how clearly um they're able to settle in response to my settling at that next session I mean I it's almost as if they you know it's almost as if I'd seen them every day in between it's just um yeah, so you don't have to start off brand new heavy, again uh there's this continuation that seems to go on right yeah and you have to make up the proper words there but yeah, Sensei Sean here Sean there I um feel as if this is a um I've heard say stuff like this before when you say Fields want to relate to Fields they just naturally do that and even if a person isn't conscious of relating to as a field if the field itself of a of a Healer whatever um uh communicates with another person from that level it elicits it, brings out that sense of field energy in the client whatever patient whatever yes are the two people recognize as what maybe a similarity or they're a kindred soul could we use that phrase or there, there's a harmonic we talked about this the other night whatever word there yeah there's a click you want to call it harmonic you want to call it a recognition and or kindred soul any damn words you like but yeah we're all talking the same thing here okay got it so you like your words fine let me have my [Laughter] words the same here yep and we confuse people sometimes if we use too many variations words oh you do it that way I do it this way and, and they get old screwy with that if they were clearer on things they could say oh you're into music oh and you're cool I'm into martial arts and I'm kind of, cool there's a they know they're at a similar level if they are in fact they can sort of relate to each other certain way did I say that right yes you I, agree I think that what you say is um what, I relate to more than anything else is when you say Fields want to relate to Fields they, just naturally do that and that's where that word came, from just that sense of like one thing uh vibrating whatever and, it responds in the other person responds in a way that is outside of the norm yeah [Music] yes one of my boy to girl games waitresses whoever I usually ask them what their real job was meaning I know waitress isn't your chosen career what's your real thing and they like that because I was going a little let me use my words for a while deeper into this system and you got more going for you within you and you know it then the occupation you happen to be in did I say that right anyway they respected it they lit up it helped me play the boy girl game back in the day when I love playing that game or if I touch them I think I mentioned I had a good touch uh meet some lady and taking her home put my hand on her hand and she'd be like Bing and later she say that did it soon as you touch my hand I was touching her deeper I was touching from a finer place to a finer place so they feel instantly at more at ease with you comfortable with you uh all kind of they know you kind of care uh whatever so was all, boy girl games I used to play and keep practicing see that's the main thing way of keeping the practice going anyway and Steve your story with the uh the singer what the hell is his name oh uh rck field yeah now following the field, connection did you want to say that story the same or a different way to bring that out what we were just talking about right yeah um you know my tendency uh to see somebody like that would be to, get very tight because here's this opportunity for me and, I forget you know to blend so, that would be my initial probably my initial take but, in this situation as I mentioned before I was generous enough and I think that allowed me to open more to say okay he finishes in his grocery line first I won't bother him and it and I think that, allowed me to, get a little bit more maybe uh 2 by two 3x3 whatever and, so when that happened I was I was okay he was past the he had checked out and something that, came in uh it was not any plan was I just raised a finger it just happened and I'm sure see you he was his back was yes his he had already gone past he did not see me at all but I did this it was just instinctive to say wait a minute you can't leave yet you know it was compelled to do that and, and he turned around he felt that he, was attuned to that yeah and his eyes were on you they weren't looking around the parking he knew he zero on you called from yes, so uh I wish I had that facility all the time but it's available going to put the time in I guess yeah no of course that's why we're doing this nonsense here h right okay thank you ah so uh finer feeling finer feeling you reach a level where it goes past Feeling Again that the dumb examples we've used are you know things you shouldn't have known Elaine knew why that overpass fell over had no pictures of it we had no had no pictures of it we had no information it just it fell over a bunch of guys got killed why uh boom 10 minutes in maybe five she spotted the second support built on the old dump of course it couldn't support the, overpass that gave away and whole thing gave away and I think eight guys got killed how do you know that how did my vet friend oh she's got a good eye dogs got a bad back my eye is not bad for dogs I don't see it but will give her the benefit of the doubt she's a vet she spend more time with dogs than, I do at that stage of my career uh but then to add because the kids are riding on his, back, whoa wait a minute there's no proof here that's only dashback after I dropped her off at the island headquarters whatever knocked on the door and said did you know your dog had has a bad back the lady immediately come back at mean yeah the kids are writing on his back we tell them not to but you know kids how did she know that there was nothing going on there are no kids riding on the dogs back at that time that was a fantastic call you start to get past normal finer feeling level we changed the word there to sensing, okay yeah now unfortunately in The Human Condition we learn a bunch of fancy words and we use them use them indiscriminately so we have an idea well my sense about that is and it's not a sense you had an idea okay it' be nice if our language were got no control and constructed so when you said my sense of this is I know what level you're working from give or take, okay I know it's not a just an idea and you put this fancy word on it because you learn fancy words sensing is a better word than, uh, an idea uh so I'll use that word and, you ain't there so we, unfortunately are languaging if you notice I'm kind of tight on you about words like don't use the sensing word there we're not there yet this is finer feeling that's what I'm trying to establish amongst ourselves who had a be able to dialogue so we know what level we're talking from if you say sensing ah when I do work with Susan if she uses a sensing word I know about what level she's at with them and I get verification by what she's seeing and experiencing kind of thing so anyway blah, blah just so you understand my, form of dialogue and why I try to be a knows about certain things talk to me people talk to me how are we doing with this so far yeah I Sensei it's dusty I've got a little weird internet connection but um I guess I like this idea of concentric circles because I work with those actually before I got into keto kind of sensing like they're, going around like this I guess sometimes I'm wondering, when to trust the information we've been talking about information and kind of like, everyone yes okay so stop there let's stop there stop, let's stay just with that piece out of trust um for one thing again I don't want I said I didn't use that diagram here because I sort of didn't like the consent circles that way that's a different picture of something all we're talking about is an inner finer level of feeling an inner finer level of feeling, an inner finer level of feeling you want to call that dimensionality you can you want to call that a 1ex one space into a 2 by two space of finer feeling we can then we move from there into a 3X3 space don't get dizzy with this concentric circles I know you don't get, dizzy don't spin off yeah okay now you like do that's what you are want to do we say in the literary World anyway that means like to do if you, should know what that means uh anyway but you said something cool there go ahead well no I think it's like I don't know for me it's like this oh verification can I take it over again, verify ah wow I went back to this house with this dog and I knocked on the door you know why I thought this lady was a sensitive but I wanted to verify that's why I went through the trouble to go back and knock on the door and ask them verification uh Susan will tell you when she throws a name of a kid at me I always started off with giving her a physical description of some mannerisms that she would recognize to make sure I have the right kid okay so I'll tell you a story of where that came about my ex-wife called me she had remarried a guy who had two sons and they were having trouble with one of them and so they called me in to do what I do and I started to describe this, kid you know this, uh his psychology whatever the inner part of him was and they're sort of looking at scans at each other that doesn't make sense thank God my ex-mother-in-law was there and we used to do a lot of work to together in this, field play field play with being psychic or whatever we used to do so we were kind of tuned in and she said oh he's talking about the other son at which time they went oh of course he is so I had asked for this let's call him kid number one the problem kid but kid number two apparently recognized I could talk to his parents and he could, talk to his parents and he could talk to me at a finer level and I could bring that out to their parents more clearly did you follow my story yeah, okay so from that point on I verify when Susan gives me the name I just don't say oh yeah I got the kid I say does this kid sort of it's kind of shy and stands a little sideways and da, and da, and she say yeah that's, her okay then I continue I verify I've got the right kid just to make sure somebody else doesn't come in uh who needs help and wants to take the stage over verify, okay uh yeah a guy asked me about some exercises for his daughter and I said to do some exercises and, they were all about breathing and I said to, him is this do she have a breathing problem and he said yeah she has cystic fibrosis I no what that meant first time I heard the word or so okay so I gave him some breathing exercises that were coming to me uh to he could play with his daughter and then I went home and I couldn't shake loose this cystic fibrosis was just following me around uh like I had to sit and go into the world, of cystic fibrosis I had no choice it was just, there okay now again wanted to verify I mentioned to a doctor friend of mine I was doing a little research on it and he said oh I got a guy you should meet he did uh, research work on cystic fibrosis okay and he's okay with psychic type people let's use that word here again okay he said I'll, I'll call him and set up a meeting so I met this guy and I explained what I saw when I was studying cystic fibrosis I use weird language it's not medically based I have no, training but he was able to follow me if I said well it feels like a cliff here and I can't seem to get across it kind of reminds me of a spark plug that can't where the Gap is too big and the spark can't go to the other side spark plug you know what spark plug is how it works yeah no okay uh and all along the way he says I know where you are I know what you're doing continue even though my languaging was weird he knew exactly where I was in this process okay what I forgot to tell him and this is where he all have to be careful don't jump the gun don't so know what to say here uh because I didn't say to him what I just laid out was my stage one I saw the problem my stage too at another time if we had a meeting the next day or next week or something would be how to approach this problem so it's not a problem and I didn't mention that to him which was dumb of me okay we my group we were practicing I think Diana was there uh some guy built a measuring ma or some company had a new fan a measuring machine we had no information other than it was a measuring machine we knew nothing more than that so for a group practice that night after iido class where at my house which is a meeting house and we sat with this, machine, and got into it finer and finer and finer and it started to say what it could do okay we made little notes said he could do this and do that and do that our contact guy to this company brought those notes to the big boss and said whatever these people come up with this information and the big boss said well we already know all of that he didn't know we had no information about this and that was phase one phase two would have been the next in advanced model of that machine that was available to us too but we only gave them phase one or whatever uh the first level of what it could do not what could what it could do easily, better which would have been worth some money for him but it wasn't made clear so anyway people if you're going to bump into a capability don't jump the gun easy I don't know verify uh don't get carried away, um following what I'm trying to say yeah who that this is Susan go Susan go ahead yeah can I jump in for a minute because I think Dusty's question is, a really, important one um you know how to verify validate what you are sensing you know you and I have worked out careful he's not at sensing yet we're finer feeling go ahead but yeah how to how to verify that finer feeling information at, whatever, level um you have just tremendous experience that you've passed on to us and you and I have a really good system for you know validating and clarifying and what you've really helped me with, the concentric circles is you know being clear on where I'm at, and should being complete at that level does that make sense yeah so that when I get a sense that there's more information more sensing that's starting to happen know where I am and I can be clear that yes this is more and then it's a matter of, patience and hanging out a bit and settling even deeper deep knowing you're going to move into the next finer of that right, yeah, and so very, important to be clear about where you are and where you've been, um yeah see Dusty would probably tend to be too fast touch something and move on and touch something and move on and this hanging out with it to register this is a particular level put a road sign up for Christ's sakes that's what I do that's what Bobby Robert n do is it's a road sign that's what a 1 by one 2 by two 3 by it's a road sign okay that hang out with these levels if, you're let's say you're doing a simp feeling your hands and you're at a level where you feel like you have more dexterity will you hang out there how much, dexterity would it be proper to touch somebody else's body if you were a mour are you ready for that are you ready to hold a scalpel and make an incision it's like not quite okay uh recogn hang out and recognize and feel experience the level you're at so it can be marked on a map so to speak experientially see I know this is not Bob oh dumy this is not NAD because those are all the signs of Bobby being ired and really getting off easy this is not NAD do yet it's, a Robert beginning to settle a bit how do I know I, can feel certain things I can I can feel a better position my butt on the chair it'll squired away this here oh my feet are beginning to feel the floor uh that Clos me in on my map where I'm, at okay so spend more time with what do call it each level experience it more recognize it so next time you hit it you know exactly where you are because it's virtually potentially the same feeling yeah but you're fast and you zip around let's, not okay you'll get confused yeah thank you thank you Susan was that it yeah that was it thank you, ah okay uh did I mention I don't think I have a front page article in the San Francisco Chronicle uh the vine Whisperer, and we got horse whisper dog Whispers whatever the vine Whisperer this old Italian guy 40 years ago so uh Vine cutting, trimming uh what they call it when they cut things uh pruning, pruning he's a pruner and apparently from what I could tell from the article uh he's done that finer, finer uh to the point where he can really feel and get information from the plant the plant tells them which limbs are, getting icky because when he cuts them and shows this observers the winery owners and stuff they can see oh that's bad inside there uh they said the over trim is bad because you'll kill the plant too often uh but the plant will tell you when enough is enough okay anyway he's getting pretty famous he's being hired by bigname wineries because uh his after he's finished with them they do much better they produce much better less water on and on and on and on he's a Vine Whisperer uh this word Whisperer uh, Bob Noah was telling us about him being a building Whisperer should we ensure you if no why not and the building would talk back to him I'm a fire trap okay and he was picking that up again in that first five minutes okay so what do we call him a building Whisperer I guess we could it's a wide open field whatever catches your interest is a potential yeah I, don't think I ever trained to be a dog whisperer which I was for a while uh but I was hanging out with dogs dog shows training dogs uh stuff like that uh but I wasn't training to be a dog whisper just something that seemed to, happen no uh so I don't know how to get people to catch their lineage yeah what lineage might bring them to their sensing world uh but I would think it's something you're interested in that you keep following through with you know a person who can read their plants pretty good uh they have an affinity for the plant and if they continue they some of them know more and more about the plants oh it's not water he needs he needs some minerals da, da, they're starting to get better at that, okay I thought the film that was around for a bit on the my friend the octopus or whatever it was uh his approach to it was pretty good uh that he got fine and I like how he was going through the stages unbeknown to him probably but entering the cold water going Fuller into the cold water going deeper into the cold water was a sort of a physical metaphor for moving into different dimensions deeper in the water a lot of things going on but he's attracted drawn to that animal an animal the, octopus and had a pretty good relation I thought he could have done a couple of more clicks to get even better uh but for what he did was, pretty, good pretty, good if you get a chance to watch that kind of follow his process and you'll see the stages he's going through and I just added he went through some physical stages also using the water as a symbolic of moving it to the next and the next in the next so keep your eye open for that if you watch Sensei it was a, documentary called my octopus teacher that's, octop teer how many octopus films are there out there I don't know but one of my favorite scenes I don't want to spoil it he's, actually tracking the octopus underwater tracking it underwater picking up on the subtle things that other people don't perceive of course of course he's in a finer feeling experience so yeah of course of course and of yeah I try to train the yido people sometimes in the old days uh okay watch that guy do a technique what' you see oh the attacker came in and he stepped with his right foot forward and the defender uh nag I steep back with his left foot okay fine obvious you saw that everybody settled, down e we're moving into a finer hopefully here and watch the same move now what do you see at this level okay and after a bit if they don't see any change there it's all right we give them one to get a little better positioned so to speak uh should begin to see other things like eventually they'll be like oh there was a buildup of energy through the attacker before he stepped and reached okay and maybe even and nag was sort of feeling that and that's why he moved early in the game or something, so I would try to have people practice by looking at techniques and doing the same game okay and on and on yeah unlimited field here what what's nice for the humans is uh functioning from a real good sensing, level uh could be amazing, uh, Luther Burbank following the vine cutter we were talking about Luther Burbank must have been very good at this uh Samuel called me and was telling me about, he would plant have his people plant a thousand plants and he'd very quickly say uh that one and that one and that one we're going to keep and do something with but none of the others uh very fine level of past feeling sensing which are the ones that want to become the uh what do you call it in Plants the breeding the breeding plants, the breeding the breeding plants I don't know if they call yeah so when you reach certain levels uh poal really being special being a gift to mankind there's much more than that but hell we're in The Human Condition if we can be better human sensing why the hell not the horse Whisperers make a lot of money I did dog Whispering just for my friends and people in my dog club that I was a part of uh never made any money to speak of in this stuff uh anyway I, think I think we're reaching the end if people will help me finish up here before I talk to Autumn anything yeah Sensei this is Sean um I feel as if there's this sense of uh what patches your interest for me that says aesthetic but that's not just visual it's an affinity an analog on a field level so um it's an appreciation a heart level you'll feel it when you feel it could I say yes, you have to go through all the body parts I felt it in my knees it wouldn't have to go through there if that's your word that's your clue good but there'll be not only you saw it but it's you got touched a bit and, it allows you to see something less than obvious which is on a finer than physical level and it's, uh it allows you to anticipate in it and, hopefully to um respond to something that you see and emulate, it depends on the situation yeah that's right tell you dumb stories over and over again I don't know if you people listen to them I'm in an elevator there's an old lady there I've got nothing for old ladies I'm sorry even now I don't have anything for old ladies uh you've seen my wife you know what I mean uh but she was catching my attention a certain way so trying to follow Sha's words I was I was being more than seeing a nice, looking old lady or looks like a nice old lady I was being touched a little bit more so much so that when I got home I said Jesus she's sort of something is still there I went to my sitting room and I sat and I said what's with this settle eventually got into ancient female wisdom which was a beautiful experience I don't remember now in 50 years 45 years ago whatever uh but it was a great experience I picked up a lot of knowledge or whatever experiential knowledge by doing that yeah so whatever touch me we don't have to go through the details uh, if you want to go through the details in your system fine but let's not make up rules I didn't feel it in my heart it does that means it's not important I felt it in my kneecap but kneecaps aren't very important only heart's important don't Cloud the issue it's too goddamn easy it's too simple it's too there okay so thank you Sean okay uh say on the program I want to uh talk to Autumn for a bit but this is for everybody but little different topic Autumn let me see you I'm here I know I hear your voice I don't see you there you are okay I, was wondering I might have mentioned this before the Improvement of your first basic character okay not the actress Okay you Okay this you whatever you want to call that i' call the first basic character that you pump the pump I may have mentioned to you I thought you could exercise with it more pump to pump and Center my style of Center is to work heavily with deeper base and from that deeper base energies flow up and down and up I'm a fuller person just a basic person a better me okay in certain way I won't be Bobby any longer I'll be a Robert I'm Fuller I'm I I'm, there better as a NAD basically character yeah okay and the second way of doing it is you with the world that you're in you're married now right uh engaged huh engaged I, couldn't hear engaged, I, couldn't hear engaged, engaged oh okay well one day maybe uh but so that would be part of your circle and it is now a bit uh but that would be part of your circle your family is part of that Circle your Associates part of that Circle you basic in your basic world just basic okay the close loved one the family the friends what whatever and you can use that In-N-Out beat also to be the character there who's Fuller with that so I showed you both Styles the center only style and the a circle to Center back and forth style both of them create a character okay you double up on it it's a better Fuller character okay why I think this is important is, uh let's say you're between jobs one, little variation here uh your, between jobs uh there you could shift to in the world of theater let's call it uh you're available that you can rise to the occasion of whatever you could be offered they're quite likely you could meet all their demands or at least most of them whatever okay and here you're setting up a, magnetism where the energies of the circular World Theater are bouncing off of the energy IES of your Center and there little magnetism that goes on there where your name might come up in a what they call it when they choose uh actor actresses for a job Cas casting uh that, your, name your face something may, pop in a little easier to them because this energy magnetism glow that you're setting up you don't have to be in the office with them I can do most my here on my front porch okay so don't worry about that uh so that's a little aside for that okay and then when you go into your job actress then basically the same thing because you pumped the pump with your basic character better as you clear the decks actor clears the decks so the energy of the character needed for that part will start to get mixed and appear take your, space and, be there where you are the character kind of thing and you can pump the pump a bit more and get all the tiny details about this, character, okay yeah so doing more with you basic will facilitate you even being a better actress did you follow how I laid that out I out I hope yes I think so okay so continuing with the basics particularly of the character of your basic character yeah with we're back to acting now or on where are we here yeah three different points three different, points three different locations if I'm already I have the rol say, okay and I open up to the character and refine and refine and refine all of the aspects of that character will come through yeah and there might be certain points times where it's good to do that I just was talking to Bob and he happened to mention you're in the one, thing you're working on is you're the daughter of somebody but if the series goes on and on you're going to be the older daughter so your character as the younger daughter won't quite be right if she's 15 well soon she's going to be 18 to be 18 she's not going to act exactly the same she's going to be a bit different right so you're prepping for if the thing goes on and on and on that you're developing along with it and the same works for casting calling me in where I go okay open, settle and relax finer, pump the pump yeah open, so that the energies can mix up a character the, system the big system loves this game by the way loves, this, this acting type or this uh creating a character thing uh that's the universe seems to think that's fun and great so, yeah we're not doing anything uh anti-spiritual here cool, yeah thank you so much yeah everyone that was good reminder for all of you I hope um remember humans we tend to get lazy oh since they can about that a lot yeah they get too fast satisfied which is one problem if someone were able to operate better from a sensing world uh could be quite famous make some big bucks do a great service uh but there's more so the one there might be this is pretty cool and a lot of people choose to just that's it I don't want to go any further I'm going to just major in this not wrong but there's more the journey continues okay do with that what you will and on that note Sensei thank you so much thank you and everyone the next class will be on May 17th Friday May 17th in two weeks thank you everyone and best have a good evening thank you Sensei you Sensei thank you Sensei thank you everybody thanks Bob thank you Bob thank you Lauren cheers everyone yeah thanks to the team for your ongoing magnificent

ready oh there I is hello okay hello okay welcome thank you thank you thank you okay here let's start with any carryovers from last time we were on hello out what, you got for us no one's going to bite the bait checking names up here okay nothing okay uh sorry to announce that we have lost Danny from New Zealand he passed away last week from the cancer caught up to him so he's taking the journey ahead of the rest of us miss him he was a cool guy, so anyway okay what if what if I had something intelligent to say or what if we've been I've been using this kind of storyline the upper half is the sort of the normal humans approach to things and we call this the underworld uh a piece that they're unsure of and shaky with but what if we change that diagram tonight to what if we we'll give this guy the whole universe that we're in okay that whole, thing and that's the uh awareness some EXP erience increasing awareness you get your high school diploma then you get your college whatever and there's all of that you read, books and you develop you develop so we're giving you the whole space and that's your developmental space okay could I say that, pattern starts from a topd Down Beat, okay no I know that, doesn't make total sense right yet but let's say that one starts down up okay all the way down all the way up and there's your world and your dimensional World your Bobby to Robert Tado do use in there is a little more room a one by one 2 by two 3 by3 ah a little more breathing space ta okay and on and on okay now uh we need a name for, for that what was that you just said sorry about that oh um we need a name for, that because what I want to do now is have there be a second phase so this is the first phase okay that you're all EXP experiencing and have been playing with normal, Stuff Plus some energy development still basic okay and that's a topd Down, Beat, now we now we settle sense of depth settling, settling again a little more room always with the settling that there more room open, settle sense is that word sense a sense of from the deeper from down here starts this second phase and that's going to be a world of, sensing thus having a character who senses a presence that centers Okay so we've got to beat down for your basics, and, and, settling opening and playing this game if you would that here comes this second picture that's right there that you won't be able to see from your first phase from your normal Bobby Robert nadoo you know the word sensing oh yes I understand that word uh but I don't mean this knowing about I mean the actual of that, comes up and is present here in your world and it's a sensing, World okay sensing, and I was a character he she who senses okay did I lose myself did I lose you, ah, that we have to clear from our normal World okay to experience to take advantage to utilize this other world that's here underlying the, first whatever we going to call that the first phase, one uh physical mental awareness intelligence some experience and development in that world now we say okay let's okay let's, it feels to me like a, curtain closing and in that same space if we go deeper it starts here is this next World of, sensing, sensing, ER and sensing the character in a sensing World sensing, right now at first all the things of the first will look what's he mean I have to understand that let me look around and see if I can see it and you went back to that first one you forgot there was a screen there or a curtain closed you can't perceive it from Bobby looking around trying to figure it out but it's here but we got to balance a bit settle a bit square away a bit in our quote First World the first phase easy deeper curtains closing sensor from deeper and from that deeper this world begins to show it's not here 100% yet remember it's a percentage game most of my percentage right now was still in the obvious heavy world but as I play some succeeding, passes then this world that comes up here and shows that it's totally here the awareness World okay that's I said awareness the, sensing world will become more obvious so you've got to play there for a while okay the sensing World sensing World ah fortunately again we know that word in our first phase the your normal world oh yeah, sensing you can spell it you kind of have a sense of its meaning but that's not the actual world of sensing itself its own unit and the character who exists in that he she who senses it's a sensing world let's see if anyone's following up to this point let's run down the list of Bob you have anything to throw in right at this moment on, sensing world as opposed to your normal dot, world uh yes sense say it, it feels like the difference is the normal World often starts with thinking and then proceeds through that grid you had talked about before you know thinking feeling and then sense feeling and then sensing this one starts with sensing yeah let me go over that let me jump been here on just one uh sometime back I laid out a pattern of thinking Easy Feeling easy settle open finer feeling and very soon getting to I brought the word in sensing there it's being next and we sort of stopped there so, thinking easy subtle begin to feel feeling easy settle open ah finer sense of feeling and we continue that for another one or two finer, feeling trying to bring you to this sense of sensing, realm okay, now I'm saying okay but we're Limited in the first phase or this universe we're in as to picking up that way the, tress of sensing so say okay now you sort of settled enough find your feeling enough sense of the word sensing but now let's right there easy let's go deeper to quote the beginning of the sensing phase the sensing world the is here underlying the obvious, physical, okay here and the importance of the experience of that okay not just staying in, your first world thinking about that trying to understand that is not that itself experiencing itself with the character experiencing himself it herself as experiencer in the world of experence there okay of sensing you want to continue B was there anything more there we can't hear you sorry I forgot to unmute the experience is one of it it's a different way for the space to open and the sense that Circle and Center in the upper world that you were describing opens up sort of at the level you're already at but here those things come from under and you can feel them moving up in, and so there's a, much deeper quality of experience there than the other way okay yeah we're trying to get the fullness of it I believe or trying to say there say there yes okay I hope I'm not losing you all too, much here world how goad somebody sorry just Chris here from New Zealand I sort of um experiencing the moment of sort of opening my eyes that was no the usual ey you, know you see it to your eyes you hear in the room that shifted for a moment where it was you weren reliant on the seeing and the hearing it was another connection with things around although it wasn't it went back to seeing because you're sensing things differently you're not relying on the eyes the ears there's a, sensing that things are different than what you see what you hear trying to hold that for an experience okay so all this your normal world still exists but I want to shift us to this other aspect that's here this underlying aspect this second phase if this is the first phase here comes the second phase it's the phase of sensing, okay a lot of people maybe I'll shift here a lot of people who get to this level at the sensing level maybe I'm bringing this up too early but I mentioned to uh, tja uh tja uh yoyoma as playing from a sensing level okay I believe he said that you want to jump in on that one Tia you thought it was pretty good when I said it to you on the phone the other day so yeah that's right yeah so can we could we say we say that um you know the what we often talk about in terms of awareness is a is a kind of knowing and sensing is a different kind of knowing so not to confus knowing with the upper knowing it is a direct knowing so that's it's the that underworld is connected with direct experience and so when we were talking about yoyo ma as a as one of these amazing artists and people that move from he even speaks about it a lot he moves from and plays from that place there's no as Chris was saying there's, no as Chris was saying there's no eye in there there's not I am playing the cello it's like he becomes the music and it it's a little trite to say but it's actually what is taking place there is a there's a blend end of those two domains of knowledge the upper the upper domain of knowing the technique and the inner um uh deeper level of that coming up but there's a Harmony that allows that kind of expression so that he can really he really because say because they're overlaid it's not a distance away because him holding his musical instrument what's he play a uh cello yeah cello uh yes that's a fact he sits down he settles with that but then he does something he goes inner to this other world and he's done enough of doing that where it probably doesn't take him too long he knows when he hits it he's in the groove or I don't know what words he would use there but he's, there and he knows it he's in the groove he's in the he's in the flow he spent enough time during doing the technical part but even from early on it wasn't about he recognized it's not about the technique it's about it's about some empowering the music from this some different location the presence in that location, the presence in that location that we're calling tonight that sensing realm that's here that sensing world that's here underlying you're normal it's I'm normal now if I settle and shut up and open I can shift to more sensing and I've done a lot of work from a better sensing place I like what you said that, the those uh those parts so to speak are overlaid it's not like there's this part and there's this part that's why I wanted to change this sense got all of this normal physical development yeah and you've got this other yeah whole style way of being and you can get there and operate from there yeah, sorry I don't know how to say to any better people at the at this time yeah that's right did so can but can we say would, you say we can say that the sensing level is a is a kind of knowing it's not a probably say anything we just have to be careful in the words so if you use certain words I think 10 people out there are going to go knowing uh then I have to say ah let's not use that word or no let's not say it that way uh but yeah there is a knowing yeah it's not the upper level but it's not my normal way of knowing yeah, right I know your phone number kind of thing uh, this is just a knowing about things how the hell did he know that yeah okay mhm so I'll tell an old story again let's use this as an example uh met a lady at Elin caught my attention we clicked together there for a bit and she was a veterinarian from down south and she's very uh felt right away very sensitive could I say as sensitive and we're walking along we pass a house there on esing property and uh see happens just take a quick peek she oh that dog has a bad back okay I look I don't see the dog limping I've got a pretty good eye for dogs yet even at that time uh I don't see anything and then she adds to it the kids are riding on his back on his body and that's why he's got a bad back where the hell did this come from there's no kid sitting on his back there's no kids running around the playground although the yard although we can see there's kids there tricycle ever so I want to check on this lady I go back later knock on the door and say hey ah were you aware your dog has a bad back the lady of the house said oh yes the kids ride on it which they shouldn't do that but they have been doing it and yes we kind of know it's got a bad back and the kids would we're trying to keep the kids off the dog's back how did this lady my, uh veterinarian friend know this maybe she had a good eye and she could see oh he's got a bad back okay but to know kids were writing on his back that's why his back was bad where the hell did that come from sensing World get into a fuller sensing world and things unfold can be seen can be experienced you know much more, than you should know one story okay yoyo Ma has mentioned his playing POS location is a sensing location is that not right Tia that's exactly right he's in the world of sensing he knows it and he says in the world of sensing I play that play that world okay now if he throws that out to musical students they can say oh sensing okay I'm, going to sense and they're still in the first phase world the normal world uh trying to sense no it's a world itself easy settle Open start from under and covers the whole Space it's in alignment with it overlays underlays your normal world it's fully here, okay where are we so far uh, Bob uh, Bob you brought up something from uh anos Sensei, reference you remember uh you're talking about the Roy suaka, thing no thing no I'm talking about ensei standing someplace else oh yes, sorry I know sense said it was quoted in Linda holiday's book that when, ensei was in shingo and he was teaching the classes there he said we were all standing in the dojo but ensei was standing in a different world than the rest of us okay hold it right there okay now Aid it's very, Advanced even, past what we're talking about but let's use that level he's standing there in the physical world with the rest of the physical people in a physical Dojo but where he was actually standing from was a different world soone saying with tonight's conversation minimum he was standing in the world of sensing okay and that was caught by Anor okay a lot of people wouldn't even catch that but he C he's standing from someplace different yeah that was my take on them too where's this guy coming from how do you get there and how does it work but knowing he's not standing normally standing in a different world okay so a hold it at that level for old Sensei but I think he went even further I think I know he went further, I think I know he went further than that but following that pattern okay you can't jump through a pattern and then you go to more advanced but different discussion on a different, discussion on a different night, ah, ah sensing, let me see if I had somebody else in men hang up second sensing, sensing uh okay I bring up another old story I think I mentioned a long time ago is the lay yod on Autumn I want to talk to you before I leave tonight don't go away uh okay I mentioned his story but let's use it in context of this a bridge being built on Chicago or some place I don't know uh and Bridge and it collapses eight guys or more got killed and that happened I heard about it from a company here in the Bay Area that studies uh I don't know what their name was fail safe or some damn thing and they would have they had Engineers of all different types and they would send them to these locations to study what went wrong what caused this, okay so just for practice I said Elaine this, bridge that they were building fell over a bunch of guys got killed, settle at, that time playing with some level of this get into the sensing World okay she senses the bridge her attention is drawn to the, uh first support first support beam not Beam for a bridge but whatever pillar first support pillar seems okay she moves into the second pillar there it is the ground underneath that pillar is vague it's weak and that's where it broke down you know what all the engineers who were on who were sent on site costing half a million dollars or whatever they get paid all those guys where the second pillar was used to be a dump and they didn't catch it and they built a pillar on this ground that used to be a dump so of course there was no real support it gave, away this isn't 10 minutes 15 minutes max how did she know that we're sitting in the dojo practicing sensing Bing she hit it I screwed that one up I saw the first support but I followed the bridge up and was checking the cement was a cheap cement did they let it Harden enough long enough so I got caught up in this and there was no real answer there well she went boom and boom and caught it sensing world is a fantastic potential World okay things can be known there that normally you can't pick up or you can't pick up so fast and so on the button right interesting okay I mean what could the vet have learned in veterinarian school uh about uh well here's what a dog looks like when kids ride on its back I don't think they have such a, class she picked it up just in the corner of her eye oh yeah the dog bad back oh the kids right on them what the hell she didn't study anything and look around and pick up her microscope and check it was just a bing, boom she was very especially in her field dogs she had a good sensing capability with, dogs Susan has a good sensing capability with the client she works on for example the children who come in as for those who don't know her she's a physical therapist but by trade but her sensing is expanding to such a degree it's getting far beyond uh moving physical muscles around Allah physical therapist she's into seeing how, family whatever is affecting the kids's uh, growth and, his physical ailment all kinds of things are expanding because in practicing our uh work with the sensing world is expanding and opening and getting clearer lot of possibil I here and it's there for all of you it's not like oh that's something oh you got to be psychic I hate that word now psychic, I hate that word now psychic what the hell does that mean you don't understand go and be psychic a what the hell psychic there is a world available to you it's right here you got to settle inner sensing deeper and there's a world that's here at first you're still majoring in this first will is there anything there what do I know about it yeah again and again and again till that world that's here shows it's there and it can be sensed experienced and the character there takes up resonance as the experiencer of that sensing world is that sort of okay so far yeah, no did I lose you well no since they used to stand there and have somebody behind him with a stick book in and, just and S turn his back okay and as soon as the guy started oh since I was already here wouldn't get hit the guy was right behind him he didn't make nois he and say he didn't do anything like that just so since I wouldn't be there let me let me listen see if I hear his, gee Ruffles telling me he's going to swing no sensing you sense this incoming thing and you're already moving out of the, way, okay yeah okay yeah don't attacker has a sword don't look at the sword it moves you from the sensing world back into this world where you're limited you got to figure out how he's going to swing the sword when he's going, to swing the sword when he's going to swing the sword if you can move in time uh it's a limited world we can get pretty good in it but compared to next and next and next heading to, more original, it's a limited World okay so where are we did I lose you you're following anything I'm trying to lay out tonight what if you understood what I was saying what if I understood what I was saying what do you got to say uh say uh Sensei to share another story that you were involved with but I was present when Richard stroy Heckler got the contract to work with the Green Beret but before he' done any work with them he just got in the contract we were at The Old City iido Dojo on Turk Street we're sitting in the back room after class and he came in he was telling us about this and he said to you I said I'm not really sure what to do here so you said okay stand up there for a minute he said you're Jon Jones Green Beret what's your weakness and as soon as you had him do that he said I Tred too hard when you read his book about it that was a struggle he went through the whole time he worked with those guys is well it was very difficult for them to let go yeah but you heavy Achievers yeah but that was getting in their way at a certain point yeah exactly you had it before he even did anything with them yeah it's a lot of possibilities just in now and there's more past that but this is a hell of a nice step nice step towards the more original we're getting more squared away in I'm going to call it our, first Universe of two parts normal part and present there underlying it this sensing part and we get more balance there ah then it'll move into the continuation the heading towards the more original of things so it's kind of important to get balance this is the type of Mind Body Harmony but not as people think of Mind Body Harmony they'll do Mind Body harmony with this half up here half of the upper as you get Fuller with the norm and then Fuller with this second piece ah real Harmony there and that'll bring us to the next, next is that okay Bob we finish on that yeah the other thing is if you look at somebody like yoyo ma or anyone who's superlative in a particular field unfortunately the newspapers are full of I'm not talking about yoyo ma specifically but are full of people who have that capability in one area but the rest of their life is a shambles what you're what you're trying to teach us is how to do this regardless of what kind of activity we're involved in yeah U but, let's, be okay with the vet was very, sensitive could sense dogs and how they were feeling she could read them by sensing them that was her field Susan's doing basically the same thing I don't know if and Ma as a nice level of that I don't know if ma could, uh, uh be a stock buyer know which stocks are going to go up tomorrow not his feels he's not his interest so although that may be possible let's leave that for people that are into stock and getting into a better level where they kind of know oh I, have a feeling for that stock or something uh but, still keep the thing open so everybody can fit into this but not necessarily telling everybody they can do everything so yeah no let's, you understanding what I'm trying to say s I wasn't trying to say they could do anything but that this process could help us in a more General way just to have a more fulfilling life yes for anybody in their particular Fields yeah, that's, all I wanted to say yeah okay yeah uh so for those of you who want to practice, uh Chris mentioned being a Salesman uh couple weeks back and I liked his layout uh to say okay salesman and do this and the sensing salesmanship okay and I don't know what would happen but maybe knowing oh that guy I'm, going to go over there cuz that's sure sale when he hasn't even met the guy yet there's no nothing's happen for him to know this but he knows it that that's an easy sale for me that will be a happy client for me and of thing or who knows whatever but anyway a simple way of doing this is Major in your own your own field then if you want to expand it into another field feel free is, all I'm trying to say there okay yeah, s Chris here I can elaborate a little bit on that one um because that does happen I'll have a, a day that's not going so well take a moment and um suddenly sort of get either told you know having a, sense of hey why don't you ring them or go in there and I'll be like it's never worked well before you know you have this almost a conversation with yourself doubting yeah that sense and then I beginning to trust more and, challenge it I guess um and say well let's, go see what you're talking about sort of thing to yourself so I go in and experience what I've been pointed in Direction nine times out of 10 it's a um a very positive experience and something that I wouldn't have chosen to do and it's worked out very well yeah and let me jump in here uh the guy in a normal World he's great at being the doubter okay so you have to know that because if you're going to play an experiment play in this world of sensing you're out of the world you're in a different you're in that second phase you're not in this first phase of a normal uh where the doubter is really Live Strong sometimes the second phase and so you got to be uh careful of, those I don't know bad habits those yeah those bad habits we've picked up in world one or phase one that we shouldn't be trying to bring those into this real there a different realm it's a sensing realm so when you play it be easy with yourself oh Sensei likes the word trust along the way here we always talk about trust and I think that's a big at if nothing else because when you, get into more finer you're starting to leave the normal realm and that's where the doubter is and if he's still hanging around he's going to screw all of your process of opening and developing and experiencing he's going to throw it off yeah so easy, I had that the other night booking some accommodation for myself my girlfriend then I turn up the next day and she goes oh my daughter's returning back that weekend like and there was a whole lot of resistance around I was like really should I do that now but you sort of laugh you missed that, one okay thank you uh did I see another is there another damp I wanted to use since there's uh, another one we talked about a little bit and that was uh Einstein as yes that's just who I saw again there yeah is obviously very brainy and can, use the first world entirely well perfectly well but a lot of his, discoveries and his deep you know appreciation came from some from, another place when you read some of his writings people can how does this you know yeah, okay here, we go good yeah what people in, this first world or this first phase of this first world uh say is oh he's, brainy yeah but he himself says no I think he said no scads of times where he operates what word does he use there um Imagination, okay that's the next fancier word but right before imagination is the world of sensing, and soon the word imagination will come in, this next not don't next piece the continuation they're very close and he works from that world so let's bring it back a half a notch and say he works in the sensing World sure an experience is in the sex sensing world right yeah and sees things at a different level that people in the normal level, that people in the normal level can't see that's why he's brilliant compared to them that's why yoyo ma in your business is brilliant yeah, right I, loved one of the things I loved many of the things I loved many of the things that, Einstein said but he would he would he would talk about what you're talking about here in a way of saying the kind of thinking that's got us into the problems that we now have is insufficient to get us out of it right so he was pointing not to different not to more thinking but that whole domain of the way that you continue to pump those levels you can have a lot of character development of character in there but at a certain point it does have a it does have its limitations right a uh, enough already kind of thing or words that I use that's that and it's a reality realm my normal basic development style right that's that but now I need something finer than that shift to sensing, when I do medical research with Susan uh well I don't know anything about Medical but I can sense up a storm but I have to exit or Draw the curtain down from my normal World okay to get to the sensing world, okay to get to the sensing world to hang out with Susan uh doing these uh whatever we do Susan uh, these reads on what's really going on with these sick, people past the obvious right yeah she's getting so good at this that the doctors send her cases that have nothing to do with physical therapists but when they're sort of H they don't can't figure it out send her send that patient to, Susan she getting very good at the read yeah sensing as you spend time there and more and more open get to read more and more and more about why and how to uh help them yeah so she getting some fast results you know anyway thank you uh yeah so Einstein yeah we also talked that t and I were talking about uh I like the sense of child, prodigies as being kids who were what how to say this I don't know born more uh closely related to this sensing world, okay that that's where they're operating from okay so they're abilities okay yoyo ma apparently was a child prodigy uh somebody uh Samuel sent me a video on a little girl was a child prodigy in England and she's I don't know doing the score and everything for operas or something and she's still at it uh being the what don't what they call him the director of the show now she's about 22 uh but she's damn good at what she does uh, she can write the music for every instrument she was doing this when she was a little girl oh she's got a big brain it doesn't do it doesn't do it right so when they in interview her and that's what they interviewing said you must have a big brain it's like dear God you're in the wrong realm here she's in a sensing with music and all the instruments that are there that's her thing well for, one thing there I'm sorry go no go ahead I'm just mumbling go, for one thing you know uh someone like that the child prodigies you know even from the their piano players at two or three years old that are playing just amazing stuff they haven't had enough time in this life to have developed the kind of, skill that would allow them to do that in the normal progression of development so they're, deeply connected to something else yes that uh that um yeah they're sensing this, other domain this other world of music and there's a there's a channel that goes right through them and allows them to uh Express that yeah, well again they're overlaid so if you're standing in that in that realm you're functioning in the physical also yeah and you lose it if you come out heavy into the physical and get caught up in looking at the guy with the sword, who's coming at you then now you're going to lose it how to retain that and be in the world yeah so that bridge that, bridge that ensei sometimes talked about he was he was able to Poise skillfully wonderfully in both he was in both worlds or had you get free flow yeah, yeah, so I think the prodigies do too the, the, that are just so brilliant you see a shorter form of it but there it is yeah, you know a problem an 8-year-old six-year-old whatever shouldn't be able to figure out and they've got it [Laughter] figured yeah, thank you anyway people if you're interested in sensing studying the word won't do it making believe whatever you think about you're sensing won't do it you're thinking don't you know when you're thinking shut up settle play the game a sense of deeper easy settle deeper and play the game from this deeper here comes the we close we dro the curtain Here Comes this next major piece of scenery this right here called the sensing World your first pass or your first five passes you're not sure and there's little glimmers of something but that's where I practice I practice with this stuff okay till it's there Fuller and Fuller and later you get very fast at it but I'm afraid to use words like that because the Thinker will say let me think about it fast there I'm there no you're, not but if you take your time and practice it does naturally get faster but don't worry about that word speed I didn't shouldn't bring it up but just you know oh since it was fast you could go from this old man to oh my God just click look at he split and he tried to explain it by saying n at this level there's no time in space he just but he had to practice a lot slowly to catch how it works to be able to do that so practice if you're interested play with it okay and again maybe it'll be easier to play with it in a Arena that's fun for you or easy for you like the veterinarian Susan with her healing uh m with his music uh Einstein with his figuring out how the universe math whatever he does okay wasn't yung in here now he threw a bunch of psychological words at this experience of her wasn't he sensing things didn't he do very well in sensing things about whatever human psyche uh that weren't normally caught by the brainy people, didn't he introduce or clarify a lot of things wasn't that a sensing world that he was playing in whatever you play you check you get back to me okay uh let's see what minor, word of caution because the sensing World in a lot of and lot of times a lot of cases is a sort of a visual don't forget that it's very for like of words alive okay and the, character of that world is very alive okay so because a lot of it will show as just being able to see something, okay you may not notice how alive it is and how alive there is a character who is the rep of that world very okay don't know if I said that well but if, you heard me keep it in mind oh what else oh that probably because that second phase the sensing world is so right here underlies your normal world there's probably been a lot of little bleedthrough where you've all been touched or been affected by a sensing of something out of nowhere and you were right on the button okay in fact I'm you probably have a story or two about what happened to you when you suddenly knew something you shouldn't have known whatever uh that it seems like it can bleed through might be a better word than bleed through but show through is there name I think I told you a story I think my sister's with her husband driving from Hartford to Rhode Island or some place and, he's a truck driver and you don't tell him how to drive not this guy no way no way and they're getting to the top of a hill and she said stop the car emphatic stop the car they stop the car they get out and they look downhill the bridge right there is out no warning signs up or anything yet if they had kept going it was so close quite likely it would have ended up in the river okay what happened that she knew there was danger I never went over the story fully with her do you have a feeling of danger uh was this not a flow through from the sensing world of hey this world sees a bit better clearer and there's a bridge out, there you better not go any, further so what do you want to call that a bleed through a flash through uh but I think a lot of people have had those okay because it's so close wouldn't surprise me yeah so I don't know if I've lost you tonight uh chat with me somebody who I haven't heard from for a while everybody shy tonight Sensei It's Autumn hey Autumn uh could you talk a little bit more about sensing um and how it's very, alive and that we need to remember that and that the character as you're going through different levels how you can continue to tap into its aliveness I don't want to talk to that to you I want to talk to you about I don't remember what we're talking about but I want to go back to that subject of you the character you Autumn okay and I don't remember what I said to you but I, may have said I think she forgot she has to exercise or pump the pump yeah, mhm yeah you said don't get lazy don't get lazy uh because remember you got it lined up lined up yourself, is fine you're in the right field of theatrics whatever you call it and that you're an actor actress you're really lined up you just forgot how to pump the pump of the centered character you the person actress, okay now my read when you said you got bumped after a show was finished my read was I forgot what I said then but I'll say it see if it's the same one tonight uh that you allowing the, character of the show that the, character you're allowing the character which is what a good actor actress should do a law the character okay that when you were finished with at the show you don't need the character anymore so you're clearing from the character and you said then is when you get bumped at the end of the show when the show is over you get bumped and I don't know what I said last time I talked to you but I'd say here I believe again this is your that, makes up you Autumn was trying to be there Fuller, okay, yeah so you'd be bumped by the more of you the centered me character Autumn the actress as being the tonight no because I think she had a little different angle on it but she's not on Susan you mentioned something do you remember what you mentioned I see your name Susan can you hear me yes sorry Sensei do you remember your take on Autumn from the last conversation I had with her yeah I just I wanted to say autumn that I it's I was impressed that you were there and acknowledged and felt the bump you know that shows a level of, of being there of being present and you know just acknowledging that bump is huge that's cool yeah you see the dumb people wouldn't catch it as a, oh a bump of energy or a bump of equality and they wouldn't catch it they'd make up some story like I don't know I'm feeling uncomfortable let's go get a couple of drinks the show is over I don't know what they do but, I think she's saying that was cool that you caught oh, something's, saying something let me open and settle and allow it to be here and I suggest that what it's saying is you let go of that character good now let's come back to you because you're a little soft here let's, establish you a bit Fuller it feels like um the need to do more of it all of the time and kind of live in that place not just use it for the discipline of a show or performance you can do pretty fast you know I can go for a Bobby or I'm fast anyway but uh but just um let see uh just something simply, oh okay I try to bring myself into a little tighter uh I I'm okay, I'm okay easy settle open a sense of Boom things moving a bit boom, or boom, inhale exhale okay same difference and I feel a little stronger I actually do I feel straighter feel a little bit wider my voice is changing I'm not making that up it just is happening so yeah you get to pump the pump in a moment so to do it more regularly why not no big deal thank you Sensei yeah so when you're feeling good try the pump to see if you can even feel better if you're feeling down definitely do the pump to stop going Downer and Downer and Downer now that's all I want to talk to you about we're not going to talk about, we're not going to talk about anything from tonight this is important okay because again you're so damn well lined up don't lose that piece your lineup is so damn good let's keep working itth okay somebody you going to pick me up hey uh I see La Steve La Steve come on say something intelligent Jesus you know I don't know if I can say anything intelligent right but a couple things just one I just want to recommend to everybody uh to catch a YouTube video of, Yoyo ma playing one of the cello Suites out in the woods by a river talking about sensing he's just him in a chair, out in the middle of nowhere so check that out on YouTube if you can talking about, sensing yeah, well he, just watch it I us was he talking about Sensei or no he's playing was God b i, misunderstood okay, no what the thing that kept coming to me uh, earlier is you know long ago we talked about the idea of trading in a character and I keep going to that with this from, world one you know where you, know you understand and all that to world two you're actually trading in that character it you know the world one character can think about sensing uh okay if I'm following you okay this is a sort of a more major tradein okay you're Steve the atome guy now if you're going to go on the ball field you have to Trad in Steve the atome guy for the guy who's on the ball field and you sort of hopefully naturally do that you don't go on the ball field at Steve the guy who's at home right, right yeah, but it's just or the you know the idea uh the, first world guy the character I can understand about fire but the second world guy touches the fire experiences it is that fire is the, knowledge is not is not the same kind of knowledge um as the first the first world guy is the first world guy processes it up here the, the second you trade in that character the second one is, is that experience like you say the experience the sensing the experience in the world of sensing is whatever name you want to give them the sensing character but careful the word character, but careful the word character he's not he am I the sensing character yet yeah no yeah careful the word yeah it's it gets more well we're into a finer Zone here sensing zone is a bit finer but there's still a character present in that of that yeah, I just don't make the word character they're too heavy a character is no, you're out of that zone right but the continuation of a character type thing and then later the characters become archetype characters and that continues so that's having a character there is an ongoing okay yeah H it but it isn't the same I, mean it's, another charact the first, world character doesn't, experience like the second world character it it's, more of a separation from what's coming yeah it's a yeah it's a whole yeah it's a whole different world it's a different, world it's a different world so world so yeah totally and because it's not clear and in your first pass or two or five don't panic trust and continue playing that game yeah, it's its own world has its own flavor with itself and the character of that has its own flavor uh Don't panic it'll as you as you continue it your percentage there increases and increases and increases uh, so it'll even be true to you, won't have to sell yourself you'll shift into trying to sell other people how great that is whatever anyway okay we're we got a few minutes if you want or I can go drink wine whatever you're call people hello out there hello Sensei this is Andrew this, is not so much about sensing danger but um about a year ago I, had I guess I took the plunge to take some improv classes yeah now prior I'd been in Toast Masters International um they basically teach you how to do public speaking um so I started taking improv classes and after about a year I went back to my Toast Masters um some of my meetings and now I've been in this club for a long time um and so they've known how I how I speak how I debate and stuff but after taking quite a few improv classes they all said that oh my God you're more natural you're you flow better you form arguments better things like that and even, um even in um my professional of course of course and if somebody does judo and comes to iido for a few months goes back to Judo going to be a little bit different a little bit better the teachers H what do you been doing something out of sh so we're talking about he's still in uh we're not talking about the second sensing realm here he's just talking about an improvement normal in the normal world uh having trouble with this we might try that for a bit and then come back to this and often you're better at this because of that shift yeah that's basically what we're saying here right yeah and it, almost feels like I'm going to, a new level um yeah well you won't get hopefully you shouldn't get worse it should be a developmental process what we're talking about here go um like and there was a recent class I just took um I'm taking multiple improv classes it was where we had to learn how to create a song on the Fly you know singing um I was very nervous I, never sing in fact I avoid singing as much as I can um but even know when we completed it even the instructor said you know You' you found your voice you found uh kind of a flow and of course everybody sings very differently and stuff and I brought that back to you know I completed the class I went back to Toast Masters and of course you know my professional job and I got the same feedback from you know people who don't know each other they've all said the same thing oh you you're come off more confident you can you tend to I guess improvise for the lack of better words you tend to you're more present there you, go can I uh ask Andrew could you say anything about how you feel is there anything different that you could express that you notice oh absolutely it feels like um it feels uh I guess the best way I can describe it it's like the difference between regular unle it gasoline and then I'm given like jet fuel back to he asked how you feel sorry um I guess amazing yeah pretty like alive there you go let's go to visceral feeling is there anything closer to your uh musculature energy level uh you know your tonality you know level of tension I don't know uh, Richard he may have touched on it let's bring him back here when he said more alive if that's a if he's actually experiencing the th of aliveness the glow of aliveness then I think he's heading into what you're trying for back to him yeah I think I guess Andrew I'm just looking for what you know there everybody's saying hey Andrew you're different where is it from your does that oh does that surprise you or do you feel different and if you do I'm trying to get a sense of how you might help us understand what you're describing I do feel different um I'd say with the aliveness uh sorry yeah I mean aliveness it feels like I'm talking about visceral um like my muscles are I'm, just gonna throw it out there my muscles feel alive like um yeah there's a hum like okay Richard, we're, on target here uh he's glowing a bit he's humming a bit more alive and, his muscles feel different but all he did basically back to autumn, yes okay uh, that's what the pump does pump, and Bobby with becomes Robert and he's a Little More Alive Bobby shouldn't go to parties because nobody's going to notice him or they'll take pity on him mhm couple of pumps there boom makes it a Robert he's Little More Alive he's got a better chance at the party and on and on that that's all we're, asking you so he's just using the word alive okay I'm just bringing up that yeah you can pump into moral liveness it's there everyone's got it but some of them are working off of small batteries they learn a little trick I call it the pump where they inhale exhale is a pump pum a moving H oh hat whatever is a pump as long as you sort of have that flavor the battery recharges or goes from a, little battery to a bigger battery and there you are glowing I am me don't call me Bobby my name is n i don't think thank you Richard uh and thank you all if there's nothing else I smell food from the kitchen me and Brad are going to head that way anything, practice, if you're interested practice a world of sensing all right get out of here thank you thanks for hanging out thank you Sensei thank you everybody you Sensei thank you Bob thank you so much thank

## The Third Quality

**Date:** Unknown date  
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW6vsy-rmyg

energy flow say again said I need some energy flow that's what we have batteries f for okay which okay let's stay with that one energy, flow I think a lot of people don't we're going back to B Basics here in our normal World here normal human, being you have an energy source let's call, it but you have to exercise with it so whether you use a, let's say an inout pump for core as an ball of energy okay and it's there but when you get to there it's, like a battery it's really dwindling down but it's still there we have to like activate it so some sense of a of a beat there whether it's an inhale exhale or a hand movement or a ha ho HOA something to get this thing going and as these beats start going uh the battery is charged so I can go from and, and ha pick up the pace boom here I am so it's always there but some people don't know it's there they don't know how to activate it, okay also we're asking you to activate it when it starts to dwindle a bit where you don't feel like activating leave me alone kind of thing yeah so how to recognize a dwindling battery and if you're interested you go whoa I'm sting a dwindle wait a minute and in some form bing bang I I'm myself I like an up and down beat okay energies up energies down after a bit they're mixing, hey here I am because the up and down was a little bit better it activates the energy or it is more it produces more energy whatever words you want to use there so I like an up and down and after a bit hey who am I now the, the boom activating the battery uh, is that sort of O okay did I say that all right you want more energy you need more energy there it is it's always been there but nobody really told us nobody explained anything about it okay how's that that's a question yeah that's good um you know it comes when I when I train but uh I forget to bring up energy during the day yeah uh yeah the training watch which should we say sort of forces the issue or you're starting to move so it's started to come alive but you don't need that I can do that same thing just playing with my, hands that's why I do that a lot bang so nothing wrong with training good reminder I don't know what to say anymore here but just be able to do it just sitting there standing there at any time you want it's there it's there well I'm not in the dojo so it's not, here during the virus thing oh I'm not in a dojo I can't train we were hearing that over and over it's like oh my God people would you know how it work you train any time with anything NE a dojo per se oh you want a Ben R yeah you need a partner yeah I'm not talking about that I'm just talking about this Improvement of self Bobby to a Robert, to an Ado that that's all available there in that beat yeah, yeah okay where are we going tonight so uh following this first basic let's call it so normal human being here I am a Bobby or a Robert or whatever and so I, suggested for this program that there's a third quality let's say basic me is two qualities whatever they are okay two qualities okay um no big deal but probably some quality that got me heavily involved in physical and in martial arts another quality got me heavily involved in spiritual research don't know if I like the phrase but uh so those are two qualities that kind of make me up, okay no big deal not now as you feel do a little process work you come more alive you're not a Bobby anymore you're a robber hopefully you're a n so you're, you're two qualities are really Bing banging there mixing up a better you okay so saying eventually it may show on itself and bump you there's a third quality one that comes from this okay it's a quality that is for many people most people could I say hidden, because it's in the Underworld people are a little leery of the underworld so they don't like anything coming up at them okay but it's a third quality that's related to your system so my third quality is mine yours will be different if we call them colors if we call it a color uh my coloring will be different than you if you're uh a ruby red mine might be an orange red his over there it might be a green his over there, it might be a green his over there might be a blue whatever we have our own okay right okay I, want to go back over because I thought the Noah's example was so such a good basic U example so Bob you on yes s okay So lately he's been playing with uh settling down playing with this third quality okay now the anything about the first just sitting settling and anything there that should be mentioned that you feel pretty balanced and, very familiar okay, but tell talk to the people you sat you settle you opened what what's your experience in, this first being here you're talking about the first two qualities I'm talking about hitting the line hitting the floor feel uh comfortable that there's a lawful Universe in which I have a place I think he's setting up a safety Factor because I'm going to enter some strange territory in this underworld but I know I have a sense I believe that whatever he just said I have a place in the, universe okay and what else did you say you said some other words there lawful Universe in which I have a place okay it's a lawful Universe it's not going to purposefully screw you over it's lawful okay anyway we sit we settle we open okay now at first the energy quality see I always refer to the under stuff as energy because that's how I first approached it I went deeper as a centered type personality that I am got more energy and I work my energy beats up and down to move from Bobby to a Robert from Robert to a NAD do da, da, okay but let's interchange that word with qualities as you sit settle open there's a quality there at first may show like energy you, feel you get a maybe more body heat maybe get a get a maybe more body heat maybe get a little Twitchy maybe have a feeling of being nervous taking the negative approach okay very few people I think not many people would say oh wow underworld yes more people like oh the underworld it looks weird it's dark it's strange monsters come from the underworld, okay so here we are so when Bob first opened what he experienced was kind of oily substance that was very unpleasant to interact with continue with the ickiness of the oil in your words well it felt like it would clog things up and what seemed like a smooth as I said lawful Universe begins to have elements to it that it sort of interferes and it clogs, that natural process up and makes it less predictable less natural keep it simple so you want me to open to something that's going to clog me who would want to do that right first sense of that would be I'm, out of air I'm not going to open to that that's going to clog me up but you continued what helped you to continue what helped a lot was a lot of the training that we've done in the past I mean these weren't snakes biting me so if you could hang in with snakes biting you I figured I could hang in with a little cloggy oil uh okay uh he's referring you heard the story before many of you uh he's referring to uh one of my first memories of experiencing the underworld was snakes were all around me biting at me, okay I don't like snakes and I don't like Bing, could feel the Bing, what the hell's going on here Bo and I continued to I gutsi it out because I didn't know how things work what things work I gutsy it out basic settling opening, maybe a vague sense of a finer dimensional level settling and opening and the snakes started to kind of smirk or smile at me I aha the game is a foot I continue to settle and open a sense of finer Dimensions okay the snakes after a while change from snakes to spiraling energies I remember when I was in I had a sense of energies I'm sort of energy prone guy like energies I oh energies and they and they had a nice feeling about them they're helpful energies continued deeper finer sense of dimensions and they're coming from this feminine Source it's beautiful and they're like her pets Bo how to open to these energies and allow these energies and that's where we're going that's a quality okay so I'm going to change the word from energy so whatever that quality, was okay let's roughly say because they're coming from a female Source say oh a feminine quality and whatever I, don't recall now doing it in that form but it be a quality that my basic me my one two normal guy normal guy here was an add-on quality a quality that I probably needed at the time how do I know I needed it, was there trying to trying to show are we okay so far Bob you want to continue this the icky oil became what it stopped being something that was going to clogged the system up and actually turned around and became a quality of lubrication and in that sense it was a good companion to the lawfulness of things okay now for my Benefit Stay away from the lawfulness philosophy let's just deal with this stuff here for my sake okay nothing wrong but for my sake stop let's just deal with the experience okay, ah okay so I infer in his settling and opening somehow he inferred or was moving it a little finer Dimension where that icky thick oil was suddenly a beneficial oil a soothing oil a uh something that would take the pressure off the joints using physical terms okay so we infer that he was doing that how do I know it well because it went from icky to something kind of nice an oil where you got a really PID good bucks for cuz it's a very fine oil okay you following me so far am I on track yes uh where are we Bob now boom, boom Oh okay go ahead it began to really permeate my body at a very deep level of experience so I could actually feel exactly what you said that the joints felt better lubricated and I knew if I was going to do any kind of a movement practice it would be a lot better because of this yeah so this energy quality starting to be present be present permeating and, it let's keep it very simple the first small piece of this and the character there is still Bob Noah but it's Bob Noah who moves better Bob Noah the better IID do or the better taist or whatever okay so this third quality starting to be incorporated mixed in the system you're enhanced with this third thing okay so far am I saying this right yes, okay so what we did there was this say this first settling in opening was icky Ah that's where people would tend to run away, okay he okay he continued that's a dimensional line into little deeper finer and the oil begin to show as a real quality thing okay his body is present in this experience so he actually begins to feel internally move maneuverability smoothness, something okay so, far yes oh where are we going where are we going uh do we want can you do can, you all do this you're sitting there fine can you all do this can you just sit settle let's say floor level sheer level, okay and with the sense of opening to this quote underworld that's something a bit deeper a little more spacious and it's underworld beginning can you play [Music] here could you tell me your first reaction could be a mental reaction or a physical reaction we're going to take the iy approach thing to it oh this is great boom yeah fine I'll me talk to you people later but for those are going that being sucked downward being drawn down okay um well maybe we can hold it right there just, the sense of oh my God I'm being it's quicksand that's where the quicksand fear comes from being sucked down into down into uh what's your negative reaction about that the resistance yeah I don't want to get sucked down there you're on quicksand of course you're going to resist it in some form right, okay it's showing at first in a negative okay unfortunately that it too bad that it does that but it does it a lot of people okay somebody sitting settling, opening acknowledging there's something underneath and I'm saying yes and it may Show Icky mud muddy okay if you're at a resort and they have a mud bath you'd go for it but, you're sitting I don't think you'd go for it okay look mud I, want to be a pure light being what mud oh no this is anti-spiritual okay somebody, feels like it's a mold a what a mold like a mold like how you make a m of sand mold like fungus no mold like you make a mold out of sand to make a sculpture a sculpture mold since a sculpture mold of a mold to cast a sculpture yeah so it feels like you're in the sand like it's not like mov in sand but like sand anyway my accent is not good okay what but I want a negative here what's your negative I can't hear the negative you sit you settle you settle you open you get a negative I think I think Andreas are you saying that you feel encased in sand like a mold for casting a statue absolutely yes okay and then there's no it's there's no negative or positive it's, a neutral state if it's just being right I don't know but he feel he feels confined Sensei and incased all right but not Andreas and Andreas if you're going to continue to talk you have to clip your words because it's blurring like crazy on my, set here in front of me or so don't blur your words for us okay, yeah okay thank okay if I open it's going to solidify me basically is that what he's saying he he's, if he goes to open he feels encased like sand it's gonna freeze him isn't there some, Bible story about the salt lady remember somebody turned around and insult Lot's wife yeah well I think he's, repeating a Lot's wife thing here he's going to get locked in he'll be the sand man Frozen there forever okay whatever it's a negative Okay who wants to move in from hey I'm Andreas the Happy Greek to Locked In [Music], man give me another one somebody I have one can you hear me this is Amy from Oakland it's a hey it's a dangerous construction site okay give me details construction site what are what your feeling don't me oh yeah looks like give me it's a dangerous construction site and I'm trying to find a safe way out so there's a fear there's uh a little bit of fear trying to like, flight out yeah let's hold it for Basics okay this is a dangerous place whatever it is this as I settle in open it feels dangerous okay right I want out of here okay that's typical here we are in this first thing negative hits you, want to run you're looking for a way out because the feeling of it was Danger okay, yeah, okay no Noah's was iy oil mine was a snake pit or snakes Okay we all want to run right there that's easy so I'm giving you a heads up that often not always not for everybody but often it shows very negative that's why the underworld has such a bad name that's why a lot of people won't in any form go there that's the Underworld the devil lives there yeah I'm spiritual I float up here God forbid I should get anywhere near, that God forbid I should even acknowledge I have a body I'm a spiritual being because when I have a body I begin to feel some flows from under I think weird so I'll be a spiritual floater big misunderstanding people it's been a big misunderstanding for Jesus centuries upon centuries upon centuries we got to stop it we have to come to terms and realize the beauty of this underworld how are we going to do that sit settle a sense of finer Dimension follow your monster I followed my snakes Noah followed his icky oil changed and there's even more change changed and there's even more change that's just the beginnings okay uh Amy follow yours and see theiner yeah I've been I've been playing with that actually and more like, trying to be the construction site like if I am actually the construction okay wait, wait yes I know it's weird we have too soon too soon too soon what's the quality you see you've got a dangerous place oh we don't have a quality yet we've got some energy movement that affects you as dangerous but we don't have a quality how are you going to become that it's, just it's dangerous I don't want to become dangerous what's the quality we got to dimensionally move a bit okay you can't do this off the top of your head just sitting right there it's too soon you got to settle to again get to the finer sure of it and we're not anywhere near there yet tonight okay so don't do anything like that okay yeah what's the finer what is it, really okay so I've played different games with it one is kind of a if, it says no you're an okay easy settle open and I played the say what game what' you say yeah bid says something like that uh well you're not at your best which is a little bit better than you're an okay easy settle open Easy finer Dimension say what and I begin to hear and then experience different things that's the pattern you can't do it that first second practice, y I see if you know too much people we can screw this up I could lay all this out and say oh I understand and okay it's my third quality and I'm a unfortun I'm sorry that you learned that much because it's not a knowledge about it's a experience okay don't know how to say that well but get the drift ah okay so the basics uh if this person wants to improve they can continue improving their, beats you know Bobby to Robert and Ado whatever, but some place you may say ah there's something more or the quality itself May chase you down okay and show itself and bump you but, but if we recognize that you're being pushed you're being bumped uh kind of nervous in the service flavor oh something's talking to me oh it's coming from the underworld okay easy settle and begin this process of opening and opening dimension till it can clarify itself till the snakes biting show that they're beautiful energies from a beautiful, energies from a beautiful Source that's your thing to practice okay I'm just giving you the first couple of steps here using Noah as an example because I thought it was kind of classical okay now is that sort of okay there seems to be something okay let's see where should we go here as you were to, do this deeper and more and finer quality and that quality is mixing with your basic two so you now you're, here you're that guy yeah I, want to give him a different name so I'm calling him the uh triangular, guy triangular guy kind triangular guy just to let me to remind me that oh I'm playing with this third addition so I'm not the Bobby as this quality begins to show more and more and I Incorporated mix it in my basic system it's an add-on uh improved, quality boom I begin to experience myself I keep exercising myself to be the Triangular guy but that's my example is that is that okay for you people that sort of makes sense whatever so this has to be exercised it's not just an idea you got uh as you exercise in your one two world that was a good start we did, tonight with that question uh that was an exercise okay see I'm feeling kind of depleted okay but you have within you inner, Dimensions is the original source of all energy okay you have access to ding, ding, the more of it and eventually a whole bunch of it and eventually maybe the beginnings of it why do you think o Sensei was so powerful and he didn't show us a lot of what he could do didn't want to scare you too much but there's a source of power along with all those fine, qualities okay so where the hell am I going with that oh so that first basic of practicing exercising just with your two beats so that when it's time for you to open to a third wallet that you know sort of how to exercise with it so it's not just an idea but you're the actual enhanced person okay Bob did we get we haven't gotten into yet the quality help me here B John yes the quality you see where I'm going what, word would you use what, what what's the finer level of that quality becomes a golden feeding quality, becomes a golden feeding quality where it's not just lubricating but feeding okay all right now tell me about a person's quality not about that stuff to as a person what's the quality what's it do for Bob Noah it strengthens my system in many ways but specifically say with the tendons ligaments on a physical level past that that's fine let's go past it boom Mr Noah boom what do you got you're a you're the beginning of a triangular guy you're the beginning of it tell me about, you somebody who's a comfortable standing on the stage and speaking, about the truths of the universe okay an upfront speaker so that whatever it was courage or whatever we want to what word want to put there the give me a word I say courage you'd say confidence, yeah confidence boom you've been involved virtually your whole life in this finally we get a boost to be confident in laying this out not saying that you were doing a bad job as Bobby Noah but this says you need more it's time go and do your job man not to put you down for yesterday but to say hey, there's more yeah looking at past lifetimes this opportunity presented itself many times and for the most part I passed on it yeah uh he's bringing up past lives here um an interesting thing seems to happen as we play with this triangular you okay again don't try to do this that first second uh but that self seems to want to start to show that it's there present okay and it's there all the time it's, it's there in the one and two guy but it sort of got wound in, the vortex of vortex of things uh so it's Bobby and it's round up around Bobby it's round up around Robert but eventually easy the eye unwind and eventually there's a certain level where self says hey I'm here I've always been here but you never notice me finally I get to show you that I'm here okay and that seems to me to be happening uh better clearer when we hit this third quality when we are playing in that world of the third quality when we're playing as triangular person self seems to want to show there so keep a heads up people yeah uh if it's just I want to go over again this exercise of it if it's just an knowing idea about it, doesn't have substance enough you're too easy to get pushed over so to speak okay uh, you have a nice idea but there ain't no body home and we need this level of body I don't mean body I mean an inner finer body okay um so the Triangular guy is a guy of substance it's he's actually there people may even begin to see it and say hey who is that guy he's a little bit special for example it's, there it's not just his idea but I I'm really somebody special how come you're not noticing me in my mind I'm really special how come you're not inviting me to give lectures around the world because I know everything insanity where are we going Bob where we going past lies past lies okay and so let's say the how to draw the self let's, say the how to draw the self let's say for some reason my sense what seems to be happening is start to play this third quality and, the self to show that's there starts to show that it's there, starts to show that it's there better I say Bob picked it up how do I know that because self is a retainer of all your experiences in including past life, experiences so while he was funning around with this it said oh by the way you had a similar experience in that past life and by the way you had another past life with very similar experience where you where you didn't you were unsure of this quality you bulked at this quality what whatever that's the self is how I would lay that out okay is, that all right yes so just giving people heads up start playing with this triangular you uh to not be surprised if something else potentially shows there the self oh boy are we going to get too lost tonight, ah, ah let's see yeah the main work is really the pumping beingness I know it's fascinating now how does it work and, oh it looks like that and it's doing that uh yeah but got to be careful just this intellectual knowing it's this experiential beingness that's critical, okay and, that's one reason the underworld uh oh sense they pushed on that okay because he said there are a lot of people with a lot of knowledge spiritual belief knowledge they said not they're missing they're missing so he brought in the body more and the Fuller deeper of the body he tells me he said what do you think I introduced waza to them that was this beginning first couple of baby for the for the underworld that's why I had him just sweaty was okay hoping that in that settling deepening that this would show how it works and they'd go huh and continue finer deeper finer dimensions and a better triangular mix yeah put that in your pipe and smoked it okay where are we where are we uh La ston yes he is yes is yes M um let's go over yours uh okay so let's see let's see uh start me off how did you get into the one you're playing with here this period of time oh well uh just uh the, normal settling easy open uh and, um uh start approaching the dark the underneath a lot of what Bob said other than the, the texture of the dark a lot of what he said reminded me of my experience that, Golden Light that uh, sense of confidence um that you're jumping ahead a little bit I'm sorry jumping ahead of B you're talking dark and suddenly we're into golden light come on Steve bing, bing, bing, okay so just this the normal practice uh for me it would be settling opening um uh um and, uh just checking all of the parts are in place um a sense uh it was helpful to, real I the character is there if even if the character is just a processor it's a character there were you establishing this basic two beat guy yes and, being and I would maybe call those two beats okay for, me one might be calm okay I recognize that I'm comfortable with that another might be imagination uh and once again comfortable as a two beat guy or a two quality guy okay so there's his first sitting check basic that he's there and he's basically him in whatever form okay right now we're going deeper right and, I might use uh for me being a center person that Center Line almost Like An Elevator Shaft allowing me to go deeper uh, from, where I am here now into, the dark okay uh starting to drop down a floor okay now in the dark I want to take a bit of a negative approach to facilitate what you first bump into well it, seems like there's a, a, a sense of um uh maybe disorientation um uh in an ocean where, things are not that identifiable and I, tend to want to be able to label things and, identify them and, it was pretty amorphous um what's going on here so I wasn't you know I couldn't grab on to any anything so you're in a space and you weren't clear what was going on quite where you were right, right and uh you know at first that's you know wanting to grab on to something uh and just trusting okay and could I say right there some people who really want to know they won't do until they know what's going to happen and how it works out not knowing could be ah they want to get out of not knowing because back in the world of basic one two they kind of know God forbid they ought to be in a n knowing space for a bit how horrible that could be for some folks can you imagine, so moving along moving along okay um what sometimes would show different times would be a little different would be self would start to appear uh some something would like break through that Darkness um that uh to me seemed like self was, was uh showing it's showing uh and um or a lot of people I may not go that way or that may not happen to you uh we're uh we're all we'll get a little bit different experiences within this situation within this thing we're in uh, so in this case the self started to say oh by the way I'm here it's okay could I say yeah, uh a lot of people won't get that at first they'll just get this ah and then oh, it's not so bad oh that's really kind of nice oh it's really a quality boom, boom, boom so I'm just saying he picked up self a sense of self pretty fast there person to person go ahead sorry yeah and yeah and, what starts to show and this is why you know what, NOA Noah was saying uh about this kind of golden for me it was the Golden Boy the, uh there was this sense of, of let me okay let, me go with the troops so he went through um more, than one level he took an elevat through, the dark then he got out of the elevator at a certain level and the quality it's a golden quality, okay so he didn't do the being he didn't do the puddle to the pond to the lake to the Great Lake pattern he did a faster form of traveling reaches a level and at that level the quality is clear to him and it's a golden gold Golden Boy okay yeah go ahead yeah and you know we, talked this week about it and, what I found myself practicing today is okay that's a Golden Boy level one our first uh you know like a Bobby uh Golden Boy not that wasn't the full the full enchilada uh okay and get comfortable and that's okay and I know there's more than that um so I play with allowing the more of that quality let it be let it be more and, as I get more comfortable with it recognizing there's other two qualities all three of those qualities start to mix and, be comfortable with, the character hold it there we're bringing up the Triangular form the mix of the basic two and this new addition this Golden Glow quality, so we okay so that right there I'd say oh yeah there's a triangular set mixing up you the triangle can we oh go, go, ahead one more well as, I allow that as I embrace that those all three qualities um you know like what Bob said about the confidence yeah there's that there there's a sense of this being that is much full ER much more complete um and you know what this was just a thought be when, Bob was talking about his is that the fact that the self is there uh um, what's, the word it, tempers uh the quality in the sense that there would be a tendency of for me to want to get full of myself because here I am this Golden Boy standing out on the stage but it doesn't it doesn't give out of hand it, feels like it's very uh full and complete and but balanced not, not pushed by it yeah if you yeah good, if you retain the sense of a character now I'm the Triangular guy a character boom mixing up the Triangular character because it's still it's a quality but it's still an energy that can push you into oh my God I'm fantastic which is what he just said yeah okay in one way I'm sort of sorry he's bringing in the self here uh because I don't want people to get confused yes there's a self but now we're working on this quality for the Triangular, guy so for me it would have been okay to say oh gee I self popped it and said it's cool my son I'm yourself you're in sort of safe Territory go and proceed but not to but not to keep I don't want to confuse the with the Triangular guy and stuff like that so in a certain way like I don't know be neater be neater, okay don't smudge you remember smudging people smudging no smudging yeah oh I'm the Triangular Spirit self uh starting to smudge a bit these are individual pieces relate to each other are present with each other but they're each a piece we don't want to smudge these pieces the universe you're caught up in is tricky enough as enough as is yeah, let's be neat as best as we can let's be neat Okay so we've got this Golden Boy you're practicing its development so it shows the more of itself as a quality okay you're talking to triangular guy here can you give us so here's your basic Steve let's call them basic Steve let's call them basic Steve but now there's this addition of this Golden Glow let say Golden, Glow let say Golden Glow the Triangular guy mix, hate the Triangular guy tell me what the Triangular guy is feeling experience what's he do one of the things that, he does is he's much you know being a center person the tri the this guy is much more comfortable in Circ in situations in, this the circle you know with like Bob was mentioning about being confident on the stage um you would be more social yeah or, um out there so to speak yeah, yeah it's okay to step out of your yard into the neighborhood yes, okay yeah give, me more about this triangular guy give me more best you can I know it's early in the game but best you can lie to me what one thing that I sense is that all of these, three qualities are much more at hand they are uh they are like tools so to speak um I hold it right there another possibility when we start to play with the third quality is you sense better these two or you sense better their presence or that they're two energy field qualities is that okay way to say it yeah, yeah so apparently a lot can happen as we start to play with the third quality or the Triangular U so I mentioned self seem to for some people seem to really begin to show there uh he's saying oh Not only was that there but my realization of my two qualities just got clearer I was more comfortable whatever with that mix basic twoo yeah, yeah go ahead well and the sense is that they all enhance each other yes, the whole creation by the way is built along that way one piece will want to work with the other piece say built in, harmony okay yeah, um there's, almost a sense of, wizard Wizardry about it you know I mean it, sounds a little presumptuous but there is that sense of magic that yeah that with hold it hold it right there in years ago I was funning around the underworld stuff uh often showed for me as caves and then another cave one of the main caves there was Merlin's cave it was magical cave it was a place where magic was created or came from Magic, was created or came from Magic yeah uh Noah what was that we used to do practice using a four count on movie scripts correct and wasn't the third count magic but I don't know if we use that word then yes we did use that word we actually looked at a movie script that was missing the magic and the movie bomb, yeah, we usually have this formula for checking out mo movie scripts uh and you number one quality meant something I forget our pattern now number two meant something and number three was sort of the magic of it and, so we were doing this uh check on this for practice this check on this uh supposedly Magic movie and there was no magic there was no three there was no, juice and we said how can that be but like Bob said the movie totally bombed not just bombed it totally bombed yeah correct yeah there was no magic anyway uh also in business guys we used to do this again this pattern check out business guys basic good business guy was a balanced one two guy okay you, check somebody else out and they got a one two three suddenly you got a shining star potential you got a got a shining star potential you got a guy who's uh I don't know business the word but somebody who's little bit special Bob what's some of the words the words there if basic one two is your general manager you know just a manager of a department fine good it's pretty good somebody else has got this third thing they're a triangular person what business words might we use one of them that was coming along at the time was the celebrity CEO the person who really trained transcended the fact that he was the CEO of a company and became something more than that I think you're into the four total four count guy but that's okay, here we're just talking about the number three addition that's somebody who's on The Cutting Edge if, he was starting a business he might attract my attention I might want to throw a few bucks in his stock early just not that it's guaranteed but he's kind of sharp he's special There's Hope for whatever he's going to do with his company one of those guys charismatic or Visionary charismatic, yeah Visionary yeah, yeah if they really got it all together they're real Visionaries and damn if it doesn't, happen that's a guy company you want to have stalk in that I never do damn uh okay so where are we with this oh a lot triangular guy okay oh again the exercise uh, back to you Steve the exercise see we've had pract earlier practice exercising with one and two and now we got three and the exercise is I don't know the word pump boom, P so I got my basic easy now this third quality up and down and here I'm this triangular guy okay again basic one and two and deeper quality the gold glow boom, all three are mixing boom I'm the Triangular, guy, what would I like to do what can I do how should I be in the world you'd want to ask soon after that does that make sense that I lay that out right you want to add anything to that Steve or No in fact what you said uh seems very, apt that, when all these things are working there is a desire to M manifest it to, bring it bring it to the four so to speak yeah so like Noah said he does want to present it after word Bob used but to get on stage and say hey yeah, it's like that so what are you going to do is your early in the game early in the game but what what's your sense of what this Golden Glow plus your Norm triangular guy what, maybe, how is that going to manifest in the world yes you'll be more social but let's get a little bit better than that you're the Triangular guy Golden Glow plus you're nice Norm what you going to do just lie to me oh god um well maybe, uh I'm going to be out on, on the grand stage accepting an award for the be song of the Year how's that that's a big leap well you ask keep things simple step at a time myself, but and tomorrow wait, I'm better than o Sensei that's a bit of a big leap okay, no but, by and large what it's my sense and, it would be a very everyday, experience as, to how I operate in the world um that you know that, that expression of you don't hide your light under a bushel would be more a, kind of a guiding theme for me as I walk into the world okay that's, what you know ties in with the thing of, being more social more uh comfortable in situations and know be that retro retroactive uh how the world comes back at, you things might happen there for you to arise to the occasion so to be that I don't know what to call that, symbology no sort of a centered biotic no it's okay reciprocity is yeahh when they invited me to esing for example, I also had to continue my development of the NAD the NAD doi to be equal to that position so some I'm in a, situation of not just my iido students but of University professors doctors psychiatrists so I had to continue to improve me to be better with that and as they put more pressure on, me then this got better there's this bing bang center circle, Center possibility in this pump yeah he rose to the occasion you know it when you mentioned that one of the things that it made me realize if I look back in my past uh I feel like Mo now I, have more access to these qualities in the past there were times when I had opportunities but I didn't rise to the occasion and I could see it was like okay there's an opportunity but I wasn't there yet yeah, yeah, even if it's sort of meant for you if you don't have the guts for it you your back off so to speak yeah, yeah you didn't mention um that this quality in normal life for form your mom wanted you to uh something your mom was doing with you where you were saying oh she wants me to stand out right yeah off you know I was the, firstborn first, grandchild you know all this and, you know I, mean I had some things going for me but I, really consciously did not want to be on stage I did not want to be exhibited so yeah that's why it became so familiar when, I saw this third quality oh yeah I remember that and but I buried it yes and, sometime when you're funning around with self uh it'll show you a historical this probably is not the first life you've done that in it's kind of fun to go over those and see you know how it was there and how you misunderstood it that we have to go over it now and really get it boom okay catch up for what lost, lost work lost, time a lot of lost time you see this getting okay with our qualities is part of this return Journey back this is not just some game we're playing but to return back what word should we use to your more original being your original Source uh these main pieces have to be there yeah they're part of the return package that's why you just can't return back with an idea oh I know I was original and I know I was very pure at original I'm sorry people it won't work it won't work certain pieces do doom, doom there's a, lineage hope I said that okay oh God we're eating up time there uh so yeah go ye and continue to play with this I I'm calling it Golden Glow yeah Golden Glow interesting see what comes of that oh Bob also will keep me informed on his development uh we lay out a bunch of stuff people you got to have a question or two dumb questions are allowed feel free um I was just thinking back to the beginning when talking about when the energy isn't there and, realizing that you can actually summon it at any time but isn't that also when the energy isn't there isn't that also a natural indication of downtime as another possibility yeah, we I'm just Ming on how that could be fine-tuned or something just have to be careful people don't overdo sort of in a sense a downtime because they just want to escape from UH responsibilities let's say oh it's downtime it's downtime it's downtime like Jesus you've been in downtime for 18 years when are you going to get out of it you know uh so let's not go overboard with that also yes downtime but maybe, even during the virus which was kind of to me a major downtime I was still pumping my pump my pump I didn't say oh the virus is still going on downtime down yeah the world was sort of in a downtime me personally I was exercising developing so again we'd have to fine-tune the conversation someday on that whatever you like whatever you want to do with that somebody that's it we finished all that we lay down we got no comments what I go wrong we're all just shell shocks sense say it's just a it's too much you shell shock yeah it's overload basically yeah so oh it's big time it's big time the underworld is the beginning of big time that's why I try to give you heads up a lot of things may happen there uh if the sense of that quality so we're, just doing those lines dimensional I might call it a puddle a pool a pond a lake a sea an ocean uh that the underworld may show to you eventually that it's really kind of like an ocean okay um don't let the bigness if that were to happen that way scare you any still the same Basics you still are incorporating and that's part of your mix who you are uh but a lot of things seem to be happening on this third thing uh even more uh the uh, for Steve for example I when I talk to him sometime on the phone I'll mention the Golden Boy might also be a, move into an arch type golden being guy as an arch type so arpe might begin to show better here with the at the Triangular time okay now that's another whole discussion okay uh nothing more to say about it clearly but so just a lot could, happen from this time on it's, a kind of a big, step okay it's not just another little thing uh get into it get involved exercise experience we'll see where it brings you okay just trying to give your heads up itself starts to show fine wouldn't surprise me that it shows really big doesn't surprise me the arch types that quality character kind of thing pushes you into the art type level of it wouldn't surprise me just trying to give you heads up that's all cuz most of these things no one ever gave me heads up I had to act through on my own wasn't easy I'm hoping to make it a bit, easier hoping seems to be the human disposition though that we uh we have to do it our way individually each of us you know yes as long I, don't know what to say here follow the basic rules of the creation we're, in but you're you and I'm me my color scheme quality mix is different than yours, but that we're in dimensionality that for me there's a one by for you there's a one by now who you are in your one by you're not Bobby you're Mikey okay and how you react in the one bu is how you react I react different, okay get me in a half by I'm dangerous and a little crazy okay but I know I'm dangerous I don't go that way I stop on this Vortex I go whoa tight enough let's go back Upstream let's unwind here sort of been there a bit done that I don't want to go back into that it's too tight but my reaction your reaction will be different yes so yes difference differences all the way but there's certain, Basics we are in a universe there are certain rules in the universe I just don't know how to say that well but uh I'll, try to come up with better words to say I, think I think what you've presented you've done very well I mean I think the whole point is that you've, shown us um not the way maybe but a way through your own life basically and how you've learned and the things that you've learned and that at least gives us um uh a little bit of an idea of what our path might be but it isn't giving us a map that says this is the road that you take yeah I'm not telling you to you have to sit on a snake, pit that was me mine Noah was icky oil uh Steve skipped his by taking the elevator good trick to a very fine level where it's golden already uh but I didn't want to start there nor would I use you as an intro to a bunch of beginners because I know they're going to go ah and they won't know how to use an elevator they don't have your time in so I wanted to present it and in sort of in the worst case scenario so to speak you know Amy basic when I settle and open to the underworld it feels dangerous I, just get this feeling or however she would wor it it's danger, that's all I want just right there and then that lead people into if you don't panic play the game easy settle open dimensionality it'll clarify yeah so it'll start off with something like not you're a total and as you continue, uh it'll be like what a great one you are how welcomed you are here at this level of you something very nice very, nice yeah but I wanted people to recognize that first ah because that's what'll they'll run away from that you remember iron, John no yes iron John iron John that Dark, Water pit in the middle of the woods and the people in town never want to go near there because anyone went near it they get sucked in or something and this visitor heard about that said oh wow and he ran to get there to get involved but again nobody from the town wanted to go near it cuz it was a dark underground pit, thing, Tada I'm just tired of the town's people running from this very critical place that has so much enhancement capability and is a potentially a major step along the, way I'm out of here people thank you thank you thank you thank you sensei

good evening everyone those of you who are in Northern California we're having a little Stormy Weather and those of you who aren't you can read about it in the naal Press hope you're all well sense will be here in a few minutes those of you who come all the time uh to this Friday evening know that it falls upon me to ask for money uh I do it humbly and with Reserve but somebody has to do it because money is important to sense lifestyle such as it is and uh we get a lot out of this and uh it's only appropriate that we send some of it back not just in our love and respect but also, in the traditional language of teacher student uh as long as I can remember so donations are very much appreciated since they really appreciates and katcha appreciates them and they don't go unnoticed they go you know straight to them to Bob and katcha you know the whether you pay through the website or you pay directly through PayPal it's, all, passing directly to them and um they do really appreciate that everybody comes out these Friday evenings and um you know it's, hard to ask for money on Zoom it's uh it's we've Fallen as a society into like oh this is free but if we were going to a dojo having a class with Sensei we'd pay a mat fee and if we were going to a Hall to listen to somebody give a lecture we'd pay a mat fee or an entrance fee of some sort and when, Ken Kon and Richard Moon and I went to Sensei and said hey let's do a virtual Dojo way back in March 2020, uh some people were very generous in their support and we made it possible for us to get the equipment and to actually Mount these Productions uh but um you know we've, settled into kind of a easy routine where uh, it's good it's good to have a routine it's good to see friendly faces every, other Friday you know hear how people are progressing in their um where I grew up in New Jersey there was a late night radio ad that played all summer every summer on some big you know 10,000 watt AM station and it was for a wholesale clothing, outlet in New Jersey where I lived and the slogan was they were trying to make a point that if you go to their store you're going to walk home with something nice no matter what your budget is and their slogan was slogan was Money Talks nobody walks and if you grew up in New Jersey say around the time I did you couldn't help but hear this so uh you know when I lived in Japan it was always a question well how do you give money to your teacher and in most dojos there are dues it's very simple you know it's a monthly fee but then what if you want to do more than, that well and when I lived in shingu and I lived in the dojo where hikui Sensei was the dojo Joo people would bring him a case of oranges like a FR fish they just caught that, morning you know a bottle of sake which he didn't really need but appreciated it all the same and he lived in a no cash Society or lowash society and somebody brought him a nice fish that took care of dinner for him and his family you know but uh we live largely in an allash Society where you know actual cash donations and in Japan the tradition is that you the teacher doesn't touch the money it's like oh I can't possibly touch the money and so whether it's martial arts or flower or tea ceremony or archery any of these traditional Arts the money is discreetly put in an put in an envelope and then you write your name on it and you place it at The Shrine where you you're not offering it to your teacher you're offering it to the Kamisama or you're offering it to the ancestors of course like Santa Claus later that day the teacher is going to come and collect it and take it out of the envelope put in his wallet and spend it but it's nice to have these rituals and we miss them doing virtual Dojo so I think I've stalled long enough since they must be ready if you can afford to send a donation please do he really appreciates it and so would I okay let's let me just check and see if he's ready and he is okay sensei I'm on here you go oh there good evening good yes, okay uh Lauren what are we continuing underworld is that tonight continuing in the Underworld continuing in the under the Underworld continuing in the under but how are you doing from the last session where we were in the same course uh so where, are what have you been getting where are we uh, whatever we covered a couple of weeks ago how'd you do with that questions problems insights wow, hang on C it's bugging me are you bugging me no okay s it's Justin I've um I've really been enjoying working with this third quality um this image of the triangle person to work from it's really enhanced the what used to be just a TW beat practice but a full balanced like a fully balanced to and with a sense of more space there's been um I've noticed more what's come from the depths and this third quality has enhanc the other two so it almost feels like it's a three beat or like a two plus one bead not just a tube but there's a fullness we call it the Triangular set but okay it's beating like that like a triangle instead of just a two beat triangle beat with a depth uh last time I diagrammed something apparently we ended up with a triangle Circle and square and Lauren mentioned that to me did you notice you finished up with a triangle circle square which is one of those Sensei favorite drawings when he would talk sometimes uh and I, I believe we're on the same sense of it the Triangular step that's under World step this, big quality of Underworld that's there uh is a very important step towards the more and more so I think we're on track there uh thank you Justin somebody any carryover from, that, session insights questions problems rah, anything yeah hi Sensei This is Dusty I'll say something just to thank you because well like a lot of your classes kind of it settles in a couple weeks or been a couple months afterwards but for me in particular I've just been taking my time more not just like on the mat but in life too and I find that it's um not being so rushed and like kind of like settling down especially my shoulders and then my feet kind of grounding like I can um I can do a lot more in less time without being rushed it's kind of an oxymoron but it's like I think I heard you say one time um in the pause pick up the pace and that kind of like I don't know I've just been working with that and it um it's helpful to settle my nervous system yeah, especially people talking to people especially for him because his system is fast so does things fast so very important for him and the easy the more room uh assists him with, that so yeah uh thank you Dusty yeah and the shoulders I used the shoulders uh for quite a while I think I was on a police force then and I noticed my shoulders were up a bit uh and I would practice just kicking him back, and dropping him down kicking him back and dropping him down and I got to a point where I could even feel him begin to climb up and I go no kick back settle down and, so I played with the shoulders and shoulders of in the police car quite, a lot anyway so I was always practicing did you people catch that I was always practicing, anyway, and again anything from your studies of the session that was laid out a couple weeks, ago your experiences with it right again didn't say this is Teresa, Teresa, Teresa I don't see your face Teresa dice Teresa dice is it can you Teresa if you can turn on your camera please oh there she is okay gotcha okay who are you so I've been practicing since the last class um every morning as when I wake up going further down and trying and is when you talked about like squishing it together and um the ying and the Yang the male and the female, um but what a tremendous difference it's made like in my work path like at work as far as going into this character of this massive manager um an explosion of energy but then also like things just like whatever was stopping me before is no longer stopping, me before is no longer stopping me now as far as being able to talk to people in a way where I'm not cowering down but also being assertive and kind and also seeing them as humans and not being like forceful either it's just like a beautiful Intelligence coming through and it's been a really amazing experience yeah and every day it's more and, more great I got nothing else to say but great it sounds great yeah been very great do things in the morning before your day is very good I'm not a morning person in this stage of my life uh but uh it's a good time to set your day up by doing like what she's talking doing something uh to set up the day o Sensei had his morning time that was very important for him and he said if he didn't do what he did in the morning uh his day was a little weirder uh so it's very important for him to set it up at the beginning of, the day it assisted him in being able to click into his, greatness his old senseiess uh because he had sort of set it up early that day so it made it easier to click in there my languaging okay thank you thank you for that yes but enjoying the practice and I'm GNA continue practicing so thank you oh yeah keep yes we're on a journey here it's, it's thank God is kind of fun and rewarding because it's kind of a long journey I know since he mentioned that he's always on that Journey you know he never uh stopped because he got pretty damn good or he got great or he kept going and kept going and kept going uh and happy he did so ah so okay what should we cover tonight, uh this is a this underworld is a big step now let me go historically uh let's see if I can say it right here let me see which pen I want, maybe now historically we've tried to introduce people to the underworld in this fashion uh that there's a little puddle okay a puddle of energy I use the energy term that and as we kind of settle and open and draw up this pdal amount of energy into the system it's a plus you feel a little sharper a little stronger a little whatever it's, a it's an A plus okay uh then as you continue you, go a bit deeper, and what word would I use there puddle pool there's a pool of energy a little bit more and hang out you up and down is the pattern that I use there up and down some people could use an in and out probably from there same, different style but same, and it's a plus you're, feeling Fuller more appreciative more aware More Alive whatever okay and then we continue on to uh another level what I call that uh puddle pool did I say Pond yet Pond okay and then a lake and a bigger Lake kind of thing so we were introducing people to this underworld in a form that was easily accessible by uh, a person in this upper Realm okay to kind of give you the feeling that hey this is nice stuff here and it, pluses you okay all right now it's much more than that but I think in retrospect that was a hell of a good intro a lot of you got deeper just naturally more, rooted a bit although Roots really it's way down here in bottom it doesn't quite cover it doesn't anyway way down here in the bottom where there we had close enough okay thank you way down here to the bottom is a real root uh root uh but going down was good practice now in the bigger of it okay, because it's kind of big and, we're, past the puddle pool pond stages like, it's an ocean for some people that's a vast dark space for some people okay we eventually have to move into the bigness of it the truth of it okay so we have to make sure that it's not a monster my monster theory that it's not a monster if it's let's say an ocean kind of set, up and there shark swimming around you're not going to go into that ocean fully, okay so far we, okay so we have to come to terms with that may look like a monster especially when you're up here more but as you settle and open and play the game oh there are sharks okay easy a sense of a dimensional opening getting bigger here finer Dimension what, are you really and there'll be something else so I lay out for example my snake story doing it in that form there was a snake pit right there okay got no love for snakes and they were actually like biting I could feel them bite me damn when I do sittings I do real experiential sitting so it wasn't just an idea are they biting me it was an actual sense feeling of damn being bitten, here but I wanted to continue so I went down another level and there's still snakes but after a bit either the next one or the one after that I don't remember now uh it's just ancient history for me uh they were kind of smiling at me a bit I thought aha something's up let me continue you I went, deeper with a sense of a finer Dimension deeper sense of finer Dimension and the snakes that had been smiling at me suddenly begin to change into energy spirals well I've got a little sense of energy at that time so I say aha energy, at that time so I say aha energy oh boy oh boy energy continued on down and there was a sort I don't know how far I got but there was some place down below there, was some place down below there was, a source this beautiful female a goddess type and she'd flick her arms and these energies would spiral up okay so I got closer to a source of those, energies and I don't think I was able to go any further at that time uh but to realize if you see a monster or experience a monster uh that you have to do a practice like that to settle open deeper with a sense of it's a finer Dimension and then they continue easy finer open it's a finer Dimension okay so that's why she uh was explaining what she practices in the morning and that there's a uh it gets better and better and better it's like of course yeah and there must have been a dimensional sense there okay where are we now so that's ancient history hopefully yall have that down pad okay let's now this is big time okay this approach here is just to sort of introduce you to it in a safe, Way in a way that's sort of useful to the person, gets enhanced, yeah, uh if I feel a little uh shallow settle down open up pool of energy up and for me up and down SLE up and down and that pool of energy is enlivening me so just for daily life it's fantastic okay so far yeah, okay I need a nod or two out there okay where are we going to go here eventually here bigly this is going to show bigly now it seems like the better balanced you are the more app that will show so let's say Bobby moves to Robert moves to NAD someplace there it really wants to show to show okay if it showed bigly earlier it would have really screwed me up I had my weird mental uh period there uh that was probably what, was happening it was too big for me I wasn't that Advance at that time and it just okay uh and then after that period i heavily took up meditation just felt that was the way to go so began to work some of these things out so where the hell are we the bigness of it I, asked a few people uh it's nice to hear from other people other words when you get when you notice get hit when you get bumped let's use the word bumped when the bigness of this says Hey I want to turn now I want to show that I'm here uh what's your experience erience of the bump uh who' I talk to uh Steve I talked to you a bit about that this week or last week or something um yeah uh well and what keeps coming to mind, is you it's like digging a hole you know as you as you keep digging you may hit some, rocks you may hit some things that you want to I don't know it seems like it might be uh too much uh because it's very powerful that underneath and I, guess what I've what I've learned is to keep digging you know and don't think okay but now I'm sorry I want to cut you off here okay you're talking about the journey and I asked just about the bump the bump remember we, talked about that's why I called you we talked about this let's go back to it D people come up with new stuff stop it there you are Steve balanced oh Mr Steve you're even more balanced sir Steve there you are hey, got it figured out you're feeling cool all's well and suddenly bump that's the bump I'm talking about yeah, um you know I, I don't to be honest with about I don't remember specifically talking about that I what it reminds me no seriously don't laugh at me because I, got not laughing I got notes here to, back me up what can I can I go off on a little, tangent that ties into your monster story okay because that because I don't specifically have, something from this week that I, really feel ties into that can I can I remind you okay yeah we had a conversation eight minutes ago and he's forgotten already I'll have to remind, him, uh that he feels pretty stable squared away he's got it and suddenly his balance is thrown off not physical balance is balance of his identity is balance of his sense of the world, it disrupted your basic balanced character are you sure you're thinking of me Bob seriously I, don't remember that specific conversation and we're, going to shift from you because I'm confused because you confus me proberly rightfully so get out of here Roy are you jumping in on this yeah you were talking to me about it so we talked about it earlier today okay and that's what I had said I had said stability so when I'm in when I'm in that a good space I feel really stable things seem very uh on uh I'm on the ground uh and then when this bump hits my stability is kind of shaking right so I'm not I'm no longer who I was in that sense or feel like it and so then I get doubt creeping in and concern and whatnot yeah okay good to me that's a typical potential for a lot of people feeling stable, is that the word yeah, and suddenly unstable even probably to even a physical it' be harder to stand on one foot right then or something right uh but then unstable about your, thought patterns your, position in the world and just a while ago you had that down pat and suddenly you've been bumped yeah, it's almost like there's like a like an earthquake or something it just you know the ground that I was standing on somehow is now not the same yeah and by the way that's a good word for the underworld showing it's there kind of an, earthquak kind of form or in a volcanic explosion kind of form uh so I like that kind of earthquake uh and so as a human being at you can't trust it you don't know what to do you want to run away and hide someplace right, that's yeah it's like I feel like I got to do something about this and I'm not sure what to do because I'm no longer in that you know uh finer level so it becomes you know crazy making you know so we've talked about the energies I use the word energies coming up and shaking you a little bit a little energy tingle up your leg or you call it nervousness or you call it stage fright or you call it whatever so we touched on this be before but when it bigly wants to show it's a potentially a real big hit bump push or the other style of it draws you down and you feel like it being drawn into a something deep and dark potentially dark uh and it's just sucking you down deep into this thing okay so you got this that style of it and that style of it okay it's when the bigger of it wants to show, okay so where the hell are we with that uh that's kind of old news uh except for the bigness of it uh but your reaction to it uh Roy said in our convers ation uh, when that happens that he sees advanc enough to know not to run and hide which would be kind of a typical you know boom Oh it's an earthquake and I got to run and hide whatever uh because he's on a journey of our, work okay uh knows he has to do Roy can you word that better right, there that piece we talked about uh that you know you're in a process and you have to start to do something a certain way yeah I got to really uh I mean to use your word settle and open but I've got to uh, I've got to be with what's taking place so I can't go further away from it I almost have to surrender into it and allow it to show itself and kind of talk to me or give me a give me a clue or give me a sense of uh what this is about or allow it to allow the energy of it to uh, kind of incorporate itself with me so that it so that it becomes uh or that I become part of that and that becomes part of me and it, kind of informs me rather than throws me yeah so, having practiced with the in that old style of the puddle and the pool you know it's, a positive it enhances you let's use the word enhance enhances you let's use the word enhance here uh, that it it's big therefore has a different sense to it than a little nervousness in your legs or something uh but it's the same Don't Panic Don't Run Away easy something's going, on and the sense of opening a bit more because you know it's big you can feel the power almost everyone brings up that word power here someplace so many people do okay so it shows its power I want to change the words eventually though from energy to a quality both the same but uh, but maybe the sense of it's a quality but whatever it is it's inherent in it is, strength but not that the quality necessarily is a power quality but just to acknowledge oh this big size is really powerful well all qualities are really that powerful okay the beginning of the creation's powerful as hell so there's a lot of power going on all over the place okay uh but that may not be the quality this just giving you heads, up oh what's the qu oh power that's the quality it's like no it's very powerful but what's its quality might, want to hang with that for a bit not jump the gun on, just, power did I say that right yeah it also seems at least for me it, seems to relate to things like uh you know if I really play with it well I, can uh almost have it a reveal kind of a constellation that's uh connected to it right so whether it goes back in time like Bob's earlier uh description of how he went back past lives and whatnot but it's got a uh it's, not an unfamiliar occurrence right it's got a it's got connecting points to uh something deeper so I really try to open up to that and allow that to reveal itself and could I say one piece of it it's almost like it's saying hey I've been around before you've noticed me before yeah but whatever you didn't pay enough well I don't want to be negative with it but I think you're ready now to deal with me more fully and to allow me more, fully like fully like that words that words yeah uh let let's shift back to uh Steve okay it's all coming back to me Steve uh I saved it for a minute Steve it's all those whired guys uh look alike I can't talk to these two guys the same time and or the same day in a week anyway uh, so Steve's thing coming up from under is this Golden Boy okay so yes it's strong, right Steve strong yeah but it quality is more the golden one okay and in there will be another beat Golden One and whatever okay uh for example I, get a golden one too in, my uh lineage and uh what's his partner compassion so it's a go golden one and compassionate, to Golden One okay so that's, what I get there uh so just uh I, don't know if I reminded you about that but F filed that away that each quality has a an inherent quality did we call that sometime back inherent partner inherent partner thank you yeah, keep that in mind on, the golden the golden one uh so and as he allows more and more that quality the golden one ought to show more and more So eventually it won't be a because I think he started with a golden cherub or a golden child a golden, golden, child Golden, golden, golden child Golden Boy Golden Boy but as he continues with it it'll be the golden teenager the golden man the golden whatever's next Golden leader the golden whatever whatever's next okay yeah so there's more to come right so you keep hanging out and uh some form of pumping the pump the more of it can be there and the more that can be experienced okay am I getting too lost here where are we somebody I just one of the things that, you reminded me of is like the idea you know you're digging into the, depths of this uh of the darkness, that you may not you may not find the gold right away but that, process of coming back to it and continuing to Chip Away uh bears fruit yeah but again back to this simple one that you were all introduced to I believe uh by going down a little bit and you got a, a ble of energy and you and you got a, a ble of energy and you go a bit more you get a pond of energy so hey what's changed you know deeper is going to be better kind of things that wait a minute C is bugging me yes no you're just enjoying the show so, okay ah usually she's in the kitchen but now she's over here bugging me okay, okay, so, you've been doing good work with this balance and a better balance and a better balance Bobby Robert NOOA one to two by three by of being able to shift from a bad day to a fair Day to a good day very good work but eventually, boom it's going to want to say I'm here and this is our next major move okay so be open oh Sensei when o Sensei taught swaza walking around on your knees he was introducing okay I think I asked him mom say something about I, don't remember maybe I said to him I, don't recall you a teaching about the underworld very much or very clearly and he said what do you think I taught them swaza for he was hoping by coming down a little bit lower in this kind of form that they would eventually go oh and catch this the bigness of it the truth of it the more original of it but he was very cautious down in that Realm uh he said because of the State of Affairs of Japan at that time well getting run towards the end of the war there maybe at the end anyway we're on in there lot of death and destruction major big time you can imagine death and destruction in Japan uh we wasted them um and that the Japanese as a culture are even I think a little bit worse with underworld being monsters than we are the, westeners okay so there underworld bad stuff the devil lives in the Underworld you know what, whatever when I touch the underworld I, feel a little sexier or therefore the underworld is bad so say at the Christian girls well not really they can be talked out of it but anyway uh bear, with me I get weird sometimes okay this big okay this guy up here the basic one two person or one two quality person will try to fit it in at this level okay let's see it's golden what if I have a Golden Boy in me what am I going to do with that I'm not do and I'm that gold uh and it won't be good enough you can't squash that in that big thing into your sense of your size as this basic one two beat character or two quality, character you really have to be open here okay and you can't as it begins to show say the fullness of uh of Roy's or of uh Steve's golden one uh you can't be too fast in taking that into your normal world and figuring that out and putting that into your system pass on that pass on your basic for a bit but don't I have to understand it no, experience it easy open more room remember easy the eye it continues easy open so the Fuller of it the more truthful of it the actual experiential Vibes of it okay quite likely here uh, it'll be an archetype character I'm sure in, uh Steve's case that it'll represent itself as an arct type the golden one I'm pretty sure pretty sure pretty sure, uh am I missing something you people talk for a bit let me get my act together over here where are we how badly have I confused you Sensei it's just I, just want to emphasize from what you were in talking about now that for, me in a smaller space obviously in a smaller space this big quality that's was trying to make itself known only came across to me in a smaller as smaller as uncomfortable and I was agitated when it was around and it wasn't clear to me what it was trying to do to help me a monster but space and settling and opening to more room has enabled that quality to be clearer in how it's lining up to me and more obvious at a certain level to what it's there to do to help and enhance the character and enhance the other two qualities that had been beating all along at a smaller let me jump in for a moment let me jump in let me jump for a moment okay so we talked about enhancing the character but I want to grow past that okay because I got my, basic two quality Bobby Robert NAD Sensei got that now I want to enhance that but if I do that too fast too soon the fullness of this and what it is will be hard pressed to really show cuz I've taken it and I'm squashing it into my normal B Robert NAD world so be careful there of, trying to do that too fast oh it's gold what, am I going to do with the gold oh it's a it's a it's a it's a uh more caring gee how, can I be more caring should I write a bigger check to the Salvation Army what should I do uh, don't be so fast okay I interjected I'm sorry you finished you aren't, continue no, I was yeah I was just I was finishing on that note of how in Mor room space has been a great facilitator uh for this third quality and a great facilitator for a lot of development is just is just with that piece is opening up to more room that is all and let me jump in again of course space is better when we did Bobby to Robert ear form we did a 1 by one to a 2 by two we needed more space and when you had more space the 2x two and how it mixes and who it mixes could be there and then we moved on 3 by3 and what's there and what it mixes and there's n do so space Oh I'm finished with space now it's, ongoing so yes of course don't forget your Basics don't mind practicing with your Basics whatever Basics we do here be very clear on the basics just continue with the basics and the trer form of them but they're still following that basic line okay people help me here anyone get confused anyone get aha anybody get any anything no uh there's a there's one piece that uh that Justin just brought up that I thought was important yeah and that is that um in the quality of opening to space I think we've talked about this recently there's a certain kind of transparency of, self and space yes, yes the sense words by the way finer self he begins to call it the transparent self go ahead yeah so um I think the part of the liberation of moving one by two by3 by in however we articulate that is to also recognize that there's we're moving more towards the uh greater U or more original Self as, very skillfully put it so I just wanted to bring that up because I, was appreciating what, Justin was saying and I just wanted to add that dimensionality of the transparency of self yeah uh yeah this is a big country this and I get the feeling here uh that the self uh can really begin to show let see about the same time we're really allowing the fullness of this getting sense of this that the self can really show that it's there at a much better level uhhuh so there's a lot going on in that step it's like a major, yeah big time step yeah, very much so thank you oh thank [Music], you T do you have any stories from all your students uh about being say bumped you know trying to catch that how a major from under starts I'm here and has anyone ever brought that up to you I can't believe they haven't like, all the time oh okay can you give us a couple examples of how they get bumped they up I think the, bump is more like a feeling of being blocked or blocked or reaching a ceiling like can't go, on uh in, meditation people have expectations of opening to Greater States and greater more and more and more, and more and place and the, harder they try the, um thicker the walls get the thicker the walls get yes yeah and that could be a time where it's saying uh that they've been doing a good um increment pattern yeah been doing a good, increment pattern yeah but there certain point where again sense words I someplace along the line here enough is enough on that you hit that and you try to continue you build up thicker walls right but if you're smart you're easy with all of that and say okay that's what I wanted to do now what's the system trying to do for example, yeah if you've used a technique in meditation like, counting your breaths or doing something like that at a certain point that it uh has what we call diminishing returns yeah, yeah and you, just you, have to let go and Trust the space in which you were engaging yeah uh to, open up something more and you have and a different pattern right yesly yeah or letting go certainly letting go of the current one yeah, to see which next one is there I've been through that more than once in my growth there I think we all have yeah there certain things I'd love doing and then suddenly didn't want to do them anymore whether it was chanting or gonging a gong or breath practices or whatever and Dro them and there' be something else though uh quickly I don't know how the time span but something else that would come into play there was another way of, expanding different way of expanding, different way of expanding yeah, yeah so what sometimes your system wants to show you there's uh there's more than one form more than one style I don't know what word to use there t you what word I think I think yeah there's certainly there's more than one more than one approach but I think for me the important thing that you're talking about right now is the letting go of the repetition don't you know don't continue to do you know there there's a saying that you keep doing what you're doing you're gonna keep getting what you're getting and um and, so that, trust in the letting go so that something new creative um you there, are many different forms of approach but you don't want to just uh you don't want to just substitute one, system of practice for another you need to open you need to actually allow that opening I think and yes there are many different forms how simple the misunderstandings can come from so the sense of keep at it in the bigger picture it's keep on, this journey yeah, that's right I used this practice at first and I like and it got me to hear and I'm going to keep at it and keep at it and then we run into that it's like no now we want to show this piece of it and then the next piece might be this yeah and that carries you along for quite a while and you develop and then it may say okay and then it sort of stops and then it may want to show you this circle to the center and Center to the circle pattern uh yeah, and the other misunderstanding might be this pattern is right and you'll go to hell if you continue with your pattern because my, pattern will take you to heaven but that pattern ah yeah right I'm well vers in that I had a good Catholic upbringing is that my Jewish friends laughing out there what, anyway talk to me people where are we here are we following any pattern for you or did I screwed up you know for me for me it also sounds a little bit like um you know when I think of karate and the uh the katas in karate where you know you could just keep doing the katas over and over and over again and You' certainly get better uh at the form of it but unless you do kind of what teaser was talking about and just open up to it and then allow what's there and the creative uh aspect of yourself to come in uh you're just going to keep doing the same thing over and over again and you can get pretty good at it and yeah I'm not I'm not uh poo pooing katas I'm just saying though that there's a level beyond that where you got to let it come through you yeah and then the K can come alive yeah I'm, sure um Lee Bruce I'm sure Bruce said that many times that the Kata types only amused him that they weren't going to get very far with that or they won't be able to continue with that so I'm sure Bruce mentioned it often you froze no sorry I don't Roy you're muted you're muted Roy somehow I'm not muted from my perspective no now we oops yeah yes yeah, that's all I was saying was just that it really uh there's a place at which you have to you have to let go of the Kata almost to allow it to come to life yeah and then see what creativity comes out of that and what movements come out of that to really you know bring life to it and I think that's what, this is as well in terms of the process you have to allow that to open up and reveal what's there rather than some expectation or um you know yeah, yeah, also brings in that uh other big piece especially in our human world here uh where the situation let's say a situation happens by law the character is trying to be mixed to be proper or equal to that situation yeah as a character go the other way with it as a character develops then the situation ought to open up okay so my dumb example might be I've got my, Dojo group and I'm doing little workshops with them but as I continue developing and developing and developing suddenly eln was offered and worldwide uh workshops were there but the, audience really expanded because I had expans i' done a Center therefore my circle got better kind of thing we, we get that set up there yeah basic okay where are we where are we somebody am I happy with did we get enough of about the, big bump or for some people the big pull down could be either hey Sensei This is Dusty again yeah on the bump maybe I've barking up the wrong tree on it or getting confused but the bump to me that first bump sometimes just feels so it's like you can't do that you can't go down to the next level or it's like screaming and angry and like no it's too big it's too strong yeah is, that what you're saying yeah when it's there and you try to come down hell no yeah hell no wrong you got to whoa hey and I talk to it I say whoa you're GNA have to give me a minute here whoa I have to open up some more because I catch that you're big I'm not ready for you give me a moment thank you and I settle and, then I approach it and see if that size will allow more of it to show but I can't do it in a split second in some, cases it's just is too much too big and I'm not there for it is, part of its Society like the way that we've been raised like you can't be anymore and you're not supposed to go down you're supposed to go up I don't know oh well yeah that's a little bit of a different story but yeah, no yeah no the if in some cases everyone probably has a story here uh where a quality begins to show okay whatever your quality begins to show, that members of your family or your parents aren't comfortable with they'll squash you that's not allowed in this family and you w and you won't allow that quality anymore because Mommy and Daddy said ah it must be bad so we get that kind of unfortunate nonsense, unfortunate [Music] uh story a friend of mine at a Cub Scout meeting or something and, at the time they the some of the Cubs, Scouts were, going up on stage and, doing something uh and he really wanted to go up on stage and he looked at his father like kind of sense of can I go up on stage kind of thing and his father went no and that squashed his State his that aspect of him until you know he's 25 years old or something and he love to go on stage i' name his name but teacher you remember him at summer camp he loved to be up there doing whatever he did right you already know back in your mind who I'm talking about but he got squashed as a child he had that was respect re, what re repress repressed for so many yeah so especially if you move into a family where you're the, Oddball I have a nephew that's very spiritual but in a family that's Macho but they're Macho guys all brothers and my brother his father was, basic manly working guy kind of thing and here he is a spiritual kid where the hell did he come from my brother never knew what to make of him never could understand, him I don't know if he suppressed him but he, couldn't figure him out kind of thing I don't think he suppressed him he say you can't be spiritual or anything like that but he, really didn't understand him I think his brothers had to explain him to the father what father what the hell is he doing or why is he doing I they'd have to explain to the father anyway it's, a shame that happens that we get tarted yeah you know it happens all the time no you can't be a musician you have to take over Daddy's Plumbing business we worked hard to get this Plumbing business we're doing well in the plumbing world and you want to be a mician no come on how many of you have been through, that you that you know I mean look at poor Jack W he's on here some place his family wanted him to be a doctor or something look what he turned out to be iido teacher yeah all right uh but the expectations can kill you fortunately he was clear about himself enough to know he was on his, journey cuz that's hard when your people are on you and expect have expectations of you and you go a different way yeah anyway so I'm sure you all have stories or have seen good stories on that talk to me I can't believe you have nothing to say talk I'll just chime in and say that I'm a living example of just the story you told you know I grew up in a in family had a family business and I was expected to go into the family business in instead I went to Japan and it was about as Black Sheep a thing as I could conure up at the time so, it's and it's true that you know, if you can find yourself you know it you come back to being a full adult a full person and if you're lucky as I was eventually your parents recognize you as uh you know who you are and uh we go on with life not always but uh it's a true story Sensei I agree we've all been touched or seen people touched yeah okay again a reminder this is a, map we're talking about this great quality that wants to show okay at your level should want to show will show just giving you little heads up that it could be a strong bump there uh but your basics of whoa boy easy settle open uh to go as deep as you can okay you may not be able to hit the bottom of it but, to go deep so I used a pattern of under, floors dot, you know levels under floors kind of the same, pattern as that I just sometimes change the word to under, floors you settle in deeper, to you eventually will hit something that stopped you a floor and from that floor that's the not the main original Source but, a source of that quality and then you can begin to play with that quality what is it an open to it and experience it not just a mind game here this is important okay uh ensei didn't I was on this dial few minutes ago but I got lost on it oh since I mentioned I think the word root how critical that was but I think I believe Jack water Jack if you want to jump in on this you can um that he only bumped into that word going through all of those sensei's writings uh that word root only once uh but that was an important word uh Beto Sensei was important word root you get to the root and then from the root is the beginning of that not the original but a major of that, quality major so it's, that big it's that, big so again you don't want to try to too fast figure it out and do something with it uh you really want to hang out with the big of it and the finer dimensional sense it has with itself that's what I was trying to get across to, uh Steve on the baby Golden One the child, gold the juvenile gold one the adult gold one and whoever the head of his class gold one Whatever, but you really want to keep working in there with it experiencing it uh you know you, used when, we were talking Bob U about the uh we went back to the, Potted Plant um and I see that how that ties in because as we as we go deeper and, You Did In fairness to you there was some connection with Roy but it wasn't a bumping quality that I had but it was that sense of letting go of the balance of the one and two qualities okay and as we go deeper there is that need for that bigger pot because we are tapping a much bigger underneath and so that our that plant needs a bigger pot to embrace all the, underworld that you that we're talking about and, that's where you mentioned the roots and the seed the seed gets planted yeah, we're sort of planting this seed down there at the roots or the Baseline kind of thing and that seed grows into the quality could we say it that way yeah, and to really let go of you know it's, comfortable with the one and two you know you feel at home you feel Balan and, to really appreciate that third quality you have to let all that other go and be with that third quality yeah here's what you have to do uh said again we're talking about it we're laying out sort of a map and you can't say okay I got it with the sense of you really got it you ain't got it yet that's the map that's the dialogue that's the beginning now somebody's got to sit there and open and experience and deeper and Fuller and experience there's some practice some exercise that has to be done here right so you understand that's nice but you ain't got it but it's the beginning okay I throw Sensei words back at you again Library yeah a certain amount of understanding this could be called Library work laboratory you fun around a bit Fuller and Fuller experiential the gymnasium you are that being at that level, [Music], boom, so anyway don't forget that part people okay say this is Gina, so I have been doing this and hit the big I'm kind of a dark drawn in it's not the big bump I get sucked sh down okay and I hit big Power place which at first I was oh is this really me all this power and saw you know Golden Boy and a woman and everything but I then do you ask to go back I've never hid it again it's like how do you get back there every day I ask and sit and okay let's just wa slowly back okay you settle down easy feeling of being drawn down okay if you don't feel drawn down you can at least parachute down okay get those steps I and you're wondering if you're looking for a floor of that whatever showed for you at that floor instead of letting the system decide what floor to work from that day that's what I'm doing really is that right such a yeah it was such a cool floor I wanted to go back yeah oh okay yeah, you be careful of trying to duplicate this nice experience I had yesterday today I tried that a couple of times and just wore myself out trying to duplicate it till I caught on after, a couple of sessions wait, what am I doing what's the quality for me today is what I started doing okay let your system decide who Bobby's going to decide po God I feel sorry for the world if Bobby decides anything major uh what good for me today let me open let me open that'll be part of the thing of when you get better sense of self or self is showing itself better self you're the guide on what do you suggest you, would like me to develop what's your guide on and then you, hear or you get a, story line or some way you pick up the guidance from this from the self you're right that's what I'm doing I mean I ask self but I tell it what it where I want to go to yeah, some days you look out and it's okay that day to go to that but eventually it's going to be no not today thank you where are we do we follow any pattern, tonight checking my notes but I don't see anything much to add anyway move Big Move Big Move big piece don't sell it short who was talking Lauren this was Lauren and I just I just wanted to say that say that um I'm not sure who it was just a minute ago referenced the Potted Plant Theory and I, find that really helpful in this discussion and the image that comes to mind comes back from like a high school biology class where you see a time lapse of a seed growing you know after it germinates it puts a shoot up to reach the, light and at the same time it puts a Shute down that becomes its root to reach you know the underworld from seed's point of view and you know the, word that I remember with Jack the word that uh ense used, Neo it's Neo it's translates his root you know but it also has this strong implication of origin or Source or you know SE we say again say could we throw the word seed in there again right there yeah you know that he, developed that image and, your image of the potted plant that you've talked about you know now in the past it's really useful that the, root in the earth that's not seen normally yeah is essential for the support of the part of the plant that sticks up that is visible without the root it falls over it dies you know and, so these this you know this diagram that you've drawn here you know to me is just another way of, showing the, Potted, Plant, yeah, now to remind people again nice picture nice vision of it now you, actually people have to sit and open and go down deeper at least to a deeper floor heading towards a base route where things can really the seed can open and that quality can really be there that needs some practice you're not getting there by having a clear mental image of it that's, fine to start but now we've got to sit settle and open and experience and a fuller experience because the awareness of this will think it's experiencing and probably is at its level but it's not what I call the, what the real I have a note here on that word uh real the real no the uh can't find it uh but the uh truer experience the Fuller experience actual experience yeah you talk to anybody whose's mental upair about a body and they say yes I have a body I can feel my body sort of but that's different let's say a jock for example coming up from boom, boom uh that's a whole different story okay so they're both saying I'm experiencing but one is experiencing but one is experiencing something more fully this way the other is sketchy not wrong but just that style that, that, level tends to misunderstand that word a bit okay maybe what all sense I was trying to emphasize with that you got to put all this in your body not in your physical body but in your inner body inner finer dimensional body uh you put all of this in the it's, here being experienced which is different than I have a better vision of it a brighter vision of it yes it's getting really glowy white yes uh a little bit different, different blah, blah anyway just trying to push on that you got to exercise a bit people okay and as you do that U more experiential a lot of the tricks will lay out for you I don't have to teach you the tricks they'll lay out for you I'll just be a reminder if I taught you slip M by something a little too fast or something I'm, good at that uh but, you have to experience my, hanging out with o Sensei and still now um you just can't say tell me about this and tell me about that his sense see if I can word this right you have to have practice and have some experience with the thing you're asking him about so he knows you're making an effort and you're funning around in there, then he'll talk to me okay if I just say tell me about this now tell me about that now tell me about this and that and bang ain't going to work his words are in English you got to lay it on the table meaning you got to have some experience with it okay, yeah it's not just a mind game of how many angels fit on the head of a pin and what was the weather like at the beginning of creation was stuff but some people love to go there into that, yeah experiential, double check that your awareness has some experience in it of course but then there's a fuller I don't have my word tonight an actual got an actual experience it's a bit different a bit Fuller do try to catch the difference okay yeah okay so again to remind you we've done this style historically as a sort of an intro but this one's coming up people this one's coming up this is a, major for those of you who are moving along this is the next major this big thing uh and of course it'll appear uh, back to uh Hawaii there you said powerful I think that word is cropping up all over the place with people I think the immensity of it you feel the power of it that doesn't mean that's quite its quality again I mentioned it before I'll mention it again might be but, don't jump on that oh it's power uh yes but I think all qualities are powerful because they're all energy okay they're equally powerful okay uh but because you pick up that sense of it the bigness of it and the power of it uh don't be too fast on that's what it is uh hang out and open and, double check yeah I feel you're powerful but what are you really or who are you really hear something like that just a be a good scientist okay right I'm not even scientifically trained and I naturally do that I expect more of you who are trained oh we're pushing towards the end I don't know how do we do tonight with this questions problems insights hello out there in the world uh Sensei Bob here hey Bob I think that the overwriting thing at least that came through for me is that this is something big that's coming it's the next big thing and pray attention and be ready for it yeah that's about what I'm trying to say yeah, uh if you've been doing a good job here and I suspect most of you have been, hopefully that's going to try to show more and more because it's a very next big one yeah uh again don't be too fast and trying to insert it in this world it it'll Encompass it it'll they'll mix fine after a bit but don't be so fast on taking this and, jamming it in here too, fast just a trick of trade here let it be let this be Fuller and Fuller more of itself the finer dimensional whatever of itself Golden man as opposed to Golden Boy kind of thing uh I gave you a heads up last time that I, it seems to me the self is showing better when we start to hang out here and play with this uh triangular sense or this, third quality sense uh that self seems to suddenly have a chance to show it's there more and present itself better so even if you've had a sense of self appear so to speak uh keep your eyes open uh be prepared for even a, clearer sense of self it seems to really uh want to show more uh one thing you mentioned about that Bob in our, conversation because we don't want to uh smudge it you know the self is going to show and, you suggested asking the self for clarity or whatever it is that you need at that at that point but then let it go and come back to that quality again yeah I think we got into that conversation if I recall what we talking about The Golden Boy kind of thing yeah and then you brought in self kind of fast there right and that's why I said I just thought you brought it in Fast and it was going to smudge potentially so Golden Boy Golden Boy Golden Boy if you have a problem or question or something you can say okay and you just put that on hold easy self, self, that's here could you give me a little guidance here a little guide on here and that's self okay self will say something and you'll hear it in some form we talked about that you'll hear word or you'll get an image or a movie or you'll just kind of know you'll know what you should be doing there and then you shift to the experience of The Golden Boy whatever is next for him there so not to smudge them yeah, everything overlays could we say but don't smudge them anyway okay we're running out of time any anything last thing before we cut and run it's Mike from New Zealand mark no Mike, Mike that's how we say it in English Mike yes correct now I was just gonna before tonight I hadn't actually um Associated being squashed as being another form of being bumped I it hadn't um I hadn't made a connection there before um but that's given me quite a lot to so in your in your case let's say when this thing erupts when this when this thing erupts when this thing up you get squashed there is that what you, said that oh what I'm saying is that um you've brought up the word squash tonight and I'm not sure whether you've actually used that word very much before I don't think so and I just hadn't Associated that with being another form of getting bumped I had they were like two discrete things up until you talking about it tonight and so for me that's been quite a an epiphany really yeah well also it's possible I'm talking to somebody else similar thing here uh where the uh the power of this third thing wanting to be present and in play and show itself whatever again a lot of power there of course and because of that it could push us here into a tighter, tighter men so it could be kind of a squashing effect mentally too where go it's pushing past NAD past Robert into Bobby into be weird Bobby oh God no not here again kind of thing so type of squashing could we say anyway whatever thank you people enough for tonight you all Take Care thank you Sensei sit with this do something with that experience it best you can you take care thank you Sensei and you for everyone we're on again on March 15 in two weeks thank you Sensei thank you thank you Sensei thank you Sensei thank you Sensei thank you everybody thank you B thank you Lauren thank you everyone

## Two Views of the Underworld

thank you so much T pleasure Sensei will be with us in just a moment I'm sure I didn't make so much sound come, out of so few [Music], strings I think uh Sensei will be out in just a moment everybody just let those final notes keep echoing through your mind uh Lauren do you know where Bob's teaching, next he'll be at iido of Mountain View tomorrow did you have something else in mind just, curious time for announcements you know one more minute those of you in Northern California I'm sure you probably feel the wind still blowing like the last two days that uh that uh finally come down here in the Oakland Hills but yesterday October beautiful spring day around here though for sure yeah today beautiful spring day yeah that's about time we've had a lot of r okay here comes Sensei good evening Sensei, hey okay you can tell by the drawing it Cates out of class talk to me uh any carryover from the last class insights problems questions talk to me was anybody out there at the last class maybe you have to call on someone I'm not do that uh Sensei Bob here hey Bob there one big carryover was just the importance of building that character and don't underestimate how important it is to work on building a, well balanced integrated, character yeah it's a major piece that's missed in spiritual work or awareness work, um the, functioning character as opposed to the concept of a character uh we almost have to come up with two words for, the upper half oh yes I have a body I'm aware of the body uh but in many respects many of those types oh let's say aren't good jocks for example they're not great they're not natural uh but the body we're talking about this experiential body uh yeah very critical and often usually lost in spiritual work or awareness work uh I'll try to say that better another time uh but yeah body experiencing oh Sensei tried to get across but he funny uh put it in your body okay that one drove me up the wall for a while put it in my body so here I'm in I've got this good size meditation space and put that in my body uh but, to have the experiences here as opposed to just here, okay put it in your body the opening finer Dimensions that are available but pick them up internally internal through your body and as that gets more experiential there's also awareness it's, so we're not saying we don't have to understand anything as you get this more experience it'll be more understanding more understanding hopefully then more actual experience okay again have to say that a much better much clearer another time but yes character the center the body careful the word body mean this in energy you'll have an energy Body Energy Dimension you'll have an energy body uh in finer there's still a body form finer energies finer energy form but it's still like of words a body a centered character ah anyway blah, blah somebody anything before I go off tangent yes this Diana um hi for those who don't know I'm on here twice because I can see you on a big screen but I can talk on my phone um anyway um I wrote a poem last time after the class uh called um I don't know just says bump from the bottom okay it's a very short structured poem bumped earthquake what to do crazy making up or down bigness stay the structure is called a pyramid poem because of how many syllables are in the lines but I think what I was remembering was that um you know there was either were either suck down or pushed up, but either way our, the importance is to stay with it so that was my Diana yeah okay uh so what do we have tonight two views on the underworld uh I want to go over hopefully clearer uh how we have been working the under terrain a bit historically okay and that's been to enhance this character so if, Bobby is feeling a little weak or not sure or whatever easy settle sense of a little bit deeper we're here at this, first one let's say and energies start to come up hate energies come up and by the way I want to stretch this piece out because it's very important up and down and now up, the, character ah the character, ah the character so very soon he's not such a weak Bobby he starting to be a little let's say Stronger Just For example okay he could be calmer he could be more loving he could be whatever but I'm just using uh kind of an athletic kind of form of it Bobby feels a little more awake a little more alert H I'm ready for the day kind of thing so we've used the under tapping under uh to enhance this character to get down Bobby to be a Little More Alive alert here Bobby we continue down to the next level okay boom and again deeper there's a bottom line there a bottom, line there a bottom floor okay and from there energies up and down and up boom, boom mixing creating breeding this character now he doesn't want to be called Bobby anymore starting to be a Robert and he's more and his expans is a bit better I'm more ready for the world not the entirety of the world but for the world I live in let's say Bo so I call that enhancement where we've been using the using the energies whatever qualities are there in those energies to enhance the character so we've been using sort of an underworld, approach H did I cover that did I say that okay, so good ground depth we talking about going deeper that's what we're going for we're talking about settling and opening if you're kind of uptight you, can't get to the ground easy, settle and open Easy soon as you feel like you're here go a little bit deeper and up and down and up that really that I call it half or three beats really seems to facilitate I think because in the old days didn't teach it that way I just thought as up energy here I am but I thought no we need to hang out with it a bit longer because it's, so spend Mist, so much it needs a couple extra pumps okay also to get a, clearer sense of my idea about a body as to the actual body the functioning body again we need almost two different words for, body yes, I have a body I see it I can feel, it yeah but that's not this body that sort of rises from under body okay so uh don't have the words tonight for that but do you follow what I'm trying to say here with this functioning body, a body that grows from the seed in its deeper using the pot plant Theory deeper, using the pot plant Theory deeper in the pot a seed is planted and from that seed boom that's a Robert seed energies up and down and up and there is Robert, okay did I say anything intelligent yet did I confuse you yet hi this is Diana again yeah okay so it what flashed in front of me was a time decades ago and where we're standing on the mat and you're looking at us and, and it and I know your arms are big whatever um and you're saying feet I want to see more feet I want to see more feet and the young man standing next to me looked to me and he said I don't understand what he means I have two feet how can I have more, feet yeah that's an upper thing yes I have I have a feet what's she talking about there's my feet you can smell them from over there uh yeah easy from deeper ground boom this thing happening it comes up from under through the feet mixing this new body hit it again little Fuller ah boom now there's a guy with ground connection if we were just using hopping or jumping a little bit for an example that guy who's done a little bit of this should be able to hop higher hop further okay dumb example but we'd have to do some of those things uh in the early years especially uh to get people to realize the benefit of what we were doing you want to hop better well then settle and open and get a little deeper and, understand what I'm trying to say and now ah here comes a better Hopper, boom anyway where the hell are we here thank you Diane yeah Diane's from the old days way back when uh not to age you Dian but uh just to give you historical give the people historical perspective here uh I I'm history we did lot of good energy work in those days really put time in right night after night after night not counting Dojo mat time oh time oh boy okay somebody where, are we where are we yeah Sensei I was just gonna say with that is that the uh the up and the down and doing it a few times like making a few passes with it at least you know it seems to have somewhat of a not only a filling out uh aspect but also a cleansing kind of aspect so that the level that wasn't as fine kind of gets cleansed out and what's left then is this finer level the real the real character there the Robert not the Bobby I, like that I, like the way you, laid that out uh yeah that let's say the first beat let's say if I heard you're right the first beat is clearing out some of Bobby's, residue down again and now this one because it's clearer here this one can be the actual Robert functioning character centered I like that is that basically what you said yeah and even a passes so you know it takes me a few passes to yeah, yeah, people this isn't a one minute thing and you got it uh some of us practice and practice and practice you know we oh yeah I understand I got it leave me alone we're not of that school yeah thank you right thank you okay so I, just wanted to hopefully be clear on the distinction between our historical use of under okay and this other thing I started to bring up last time or lately uh, this third great quality I didn't want people to get too confused between what we're doing here and that presentation if and when it comes to you okay, ah, the yeah Steve, I just you know I don't see it as, confused between the two because in a sense in or you, mentioned it the at the last uh Workshop um about really getting down underneath and it seems to me that before you really can get down underneath you got to be able to be in your feet at least you got to be able to, have some connection to your physical being in someway so you're not just up here thinking about oh I'm gonna get down underneath yeah um yeah again the up here guy understands down under he understands basement oh yeah basement yeah he understands deeper he understands uh underground caves he understands all of that but to and I think what you're saying is Well first, basic just be here a bit more okay now as I check my body I'm a little fast at this what I'm feeling is my butt my butt Bones on the chair I really, feel it really just kind of stood out okay easy a little bit more ah settle ah oh, I felt my a little warmth in the bottom of my feet touching the, floor okay easy now just a feeling this is a general settled with the whole system so nothing particular a physical point but just a feeling of all of me is more settled okay, yeah, then I double check it okay and I had this feeling of a bit of a floor spread in fact my hands I think move that way bit of a floor spread that Clues me that I'm at floor level and sort of okay there how do I know because it's a ah a floor okay soon I'll start to go deeper I'll settle into deeper and then we'll start this process here is that what we're talking about yeah, yeah I don't want to start digging down deep if I'm yeah basic basally don't start it from up here right you're not really starting yeah I mean you may start your you may really begin from there but you're not beginning yet anything that this guy was thinking about or bitching about in my early meditation years I wouldn't say I'm meditating now because I was sitting on quote my meditation pillow in my quote, my meditation pillow in my quote meditation room I wasn't there yet even though I was sitting on a pillow in the room I was up here still bitching about work or that idiot over there or whatever only when I got down ah to where to think about the of the day I'd have to make a real effort to get back to the of the day it just wasn't there then I said now, inner sensing finer the meditation is starting yeah, so getting habit of not of, your version of, that did I cut you off no, that's, exactly what I was trying to get across um because you know referring back to last workshop and you really talked about coming down deeper um much of what I found myself doing for the last few weeks is uh is, really coming uh it's almost like an excavation, you're just uh going down but you're, just uh going down but you're going down from a fullness not from you know like you said not up here there's a real chipping away I think that's part of what you said putting your time in you have to do some chipping away yeah again this distinction between let's call it a awareness experience is different than I don't know what to call it the actual experience yeah so again we need maybe better words there but, that's where the upper types usually very smart people good brains whatever, whatever uh and some of them have a body some have a pretty good body some might even be athletes, okay but to continue to be better then they have to sort of reverse this pattern and from the deeper Under start to get a fuller body full her body that's what ense had sadu o do okay I believe sat o was one of the sort of awareness types but he was a good athlete, okay he went from a guy with a lot of Promise batting to suddenly going into a long-term slump and became the strikeout King his batting coach was a Niko Guy brought him to the dojo to meet ensei and ensei said we got to get you down there a bit okay so he had him stand on one foot I don't go crazy on that one that was for Sado oh you stand on one foot don't you all you don't have to all stand on one foot that was and by doing that Sado got deeper and deeper and from The Depths this mix creating soon to be the hitting champion of all times this fantastic guy okay all right but I lay that story out okay with what we're talking about yeah so ensei himself of course was aware of before he became ensei in his martial arts journey of course was very well centered and had a hell of a body and stuff like that and he got really, good but he said to me that uh at that time he was also hit and miss a lot something just wasn't there uh Touch Of Confusion because of the hit and miss so that's when he is drawn to a taka sensei now TAA is could I say brilliant at this deeper centered character thing he really went down deep with it mixed up one hell of a warrior okay and he was just good at that so ensei studied hung out was mentored at that time with this Fuller, deeper and then when he caught on to that he was also he was good before but now he's even better and then he has to move on to the next guide teacher uh who introduces the clearer sense of what the circle is if we're talking about this as Mainline Center where am I going where am I going so ensei basically did what we're trying to do here with let's enhance this character let's go a bit deeper up and down and up enhance character not just once people practice it practice it because I figure the first few at least there's a lot of awareness about it but as you continue it becomes more and more experiential okay and as you play with it you can kind of catch your own P percentage but I figure my first pass is heavily awareness of it with some actual experience of this who grows from the depths okay but as I continue the percentage changes with more and more of this unit that grows from the deeper and less mental awareness whatever how's it going did I say that right are the stories fitting in so since they did it had sahad o do it and dramatic change he was trying to get us to do it when I asked him about this he said well why do you think I taught SWAT waza for the Nikos that's where we walk around on our knees and do techniques from our knees it was a, way of getting people to hopefully be on the mat floor on their knees the first thing when you're on your knees if you're going to think you, sort of topple over very easy okay so you learn real quick you can't be thinking and walking around on your knees because it so there's that first you settle down to let's say mat level or floor level uh and you can move around without that thing, happening as you sit you basically hopefully settle and open a bit now you're tapping that first puddle pool pond set up there it take that first p pudle of energy and if you're smart you intake it and you do a three count up and down and up as that character guy who's on his knees doing technique he should be a whatever a stronger, more move better something there ought to be an enhancement of the character okay so that's oens keeps telling me that's why and again the teacher learn and you've heard this before but they learned when Sensei was around he's going to about any techniques they're doing standing up so if they notice he was around quickly the whole class would go down and the teacher would be teaching him SWAT waza because I sense they wouldn't said well there's hope they're down there let's hope they connect with that d, da I don't think now again uh certain communication things with ensei like what do he say in the dojo all the time uh but I don't think ensei clearly laid out how this worked I think more it was I'll introduce them to this and hope that some of them go deeper and hope that they realize how this works that's my sense of it okay so, far we're on the same pattern okay hey so enhancement um is Autumn on tonight yeah she is hi Sensei hey Adam H I'm not sure where you are today because I hav been checked on checked on you uh I'm sorry people but sometimes I can scan from a distance um so you set your gig up this life very nice my first catch on you uh yourself said hey it's very important in this life that we do show business that we get into acting okay that really helps when a self is there saying let's do this a lot of guidance okay it seems to me though again I haven't checked on you lately but it seems to me there was a little time uh in, there and know it's the last year whatever, where you're not pumping the pump you're not pumping the pump you're not pumping the pump quite enough and you can pick that up when you're saying uh gee do I really have it or anything like that you got to start pumping the pump okay the actress character may start to fade of course we'll fade a bit but boom we can pump it back up real fast and even move on so if you're following what I'm saying double check that you're pumping the pump for the actress centered character okay because I think that one's sort of got lost in there a little bit and what a shame when you set it up so nice go ahead I'm sorry oh that's okay thank you that, is very true I think um I, it's, the deeper you go kind of the more sensation and experience comes to be experienced right yeah, yeah um and again the three count people is Fuller in full so there more experience yeah I just love the three count I used to just do it as a one count but the three count really, seems to improve it more, I'm sorry go ahead I was just gonna ask would you say that having the three count and going deeper allow you to get bumped out less well you won't get bumped out by the things that used to bump you out you'll get bumped out by the [Laughter], next okay there may be a time where you're a good actress very good actress and one day lo and behold great actress will bump you it's, the way of Creation in a certain way the creation, in a certain way the creation doesn't want us to stop recreating ourselves and when we stop it tries your system tries to bump you a little bit to say come on come on okay and it bumps in many different ways okay yeah but there will be some kind potential bump go ahead I find uh I get bumped out after more than I do during now let's see after, the show is over after what if it's saying what if it's saying you did good and bump there's more yeah so you can't rest on your laurels for when you had a good night no unfortunately sometimes I get not now I need a day off leave me alone kind of exactly yeah or sometimes it bumps at a time where no I'm busy doing this not now kind of thing I'll come back to you in a few hours when I'm free okay right it's a way of life or whatever yeah but that, would be uh more my sense of, that okay thank good there's more yeah, yeah I'm, I'd almost put money down on that one if you want I could fine-tune and scan your system one day but well trust me on that one that that's what's happening okay people uh thank you got where yeah getting back using the actress as an example as the actress, as an example as the actress gets better playing this kind of process, than the world she's in what the world of theater whatever the world of world of theater whatever the world of theater is more in harmony so the better Fuller More Alive glowing the actress is the more apt the theater world will take notice okay more apt to receive uh, rolls but if you're starting to dwindle now, that's weakening also so if that Center weakens then the world trying to support you sort of can't having trouble but this comes more alive and More Alive and More Alive there's a law that the worlder and is being touched by that okay but I say that right you catch that yeah, all yeah all and again you may not get instant results you know you could do a whole afternoon pumping the pump speak uh and nobody calls you that day to offer you a job it's not necessarily instantaneous but if you keep it up how long I don't know 3 days 3 weeks three I don't know but if you're really into this you keep it up you keep it up you keep it up [Music] boom okay so it's not a one minute thing yeah s Chris, here from New Zealand um much the same sort of story had a my job is in sales so I had a couple of weeks of sort of down not great not the same Rhythm I had previous months so um, I think late last week early this week maybe I sort of was driving thinking well maybe I am in that dark the down the Deep sort of being pushed into the deep dark so I took the time to up and down pump, and then after that I guess the negative emotions the that are attached to you know bad performance you suddenly start shining about remembering what you bring to the sales what comes from the sales what sales what comes from the sales what character you are um and that helped and from there the, growth and sort of I guess the bit more of the joy came back into what I was doing remembering and experiencing people remembering and experiencing yeah you know uh I can step on the mat today and remember how damn good I was 10 15 years ago but I can't do it so it's not just memory it's the actual experience boom actual experience boom actual experience yeah I just wanted to remind that sorry yeah and it and it was good to experience and it was well when you say reminder the experiences this is what you bring this is the, joy you bring to that situation or the, character you bring and pretty much I could almost guarantee it's sort of after a bit of a moment that it that it turned well I didn't see the darkness anymore the light was more coming out so I wasn't in the dark I felt I wasn't in that bottom layer I come up but that's, the bottom line at the level you're at yeah good enough deep enough now we're the seed is planted here of salesman and boom up and down and up and, here he comes back again with knowledge about oh you're supposed to be uh remember that you're whatever you said giving Joy or whatever you said and he remembers experiences that again oh yeah and has even more of something there yeah he's upgrading as a Salesman and it was the balance of that, that dark experience coming back up to that I guess that light experience what come out in the character there was a balance there it's like yes I understand that part yeah I've experienced that now this part and the mixing yeah great that which was a great help thank you was a great, experience no this should be kind of fun yeah to be exciting a certain way I mean to shift from a Bobby to a Robert even it's kind of wow I'm such a nerd or whatever I am as a Bobby what an he is uh and just a bity of Shifting to a Robert with the energies and whatever the enhancement that Robert had even that little shift is kind of kind of wow so I enjoy the out of this work although there are times where oh my god of course you know we all have that pattern going on okay but we don't commit suicide here we, know it's the next getting ready and, we ride the next and whatever yeah so basic training patterns anyone who's trained long term knows this they had to go through it you know yeah every everybody has a runner wall is that what they call it I can't run any further I can't go but when they break through that wall they continue and they're ah they're feeling revived and they were just ready to die a minute ago saying no, more please no more but they learn how to move through and boom they're at a different level yeah we say second win nice phrase but it really means that, let's say the runner is a Bobby he, can only go half a mile he runs into a wall there but if he learns how to pass through that wall there's a Robert running so that's what second win is in my, terminology than, you Chris go e and sell okay what was funny was the um that the, time that it actually was I was allowed to go deeper I don't know if that's quite the right word but I had the sense to go a little bit deeper and really experience where I was like the weeks before it was sort of trye but it was sort of didn't quite mix correctly and then and I couldn't say what the moment was going through the same process it almost allowed a bit more depth a bit more experience in the darkness and I guess maybe even an acceptance and experiencing what was and, that change brought the character out more okay well Sensei loves this word soaking he uses it in many different places I think to soak for a while at this uh whatever level you're at where the seed is planted okay where the light begins to show to hang out there okay hang out there and maybe you picked up hang out here a little earlier through the dark hang out here it's okay it's just dark you know the game it's going to go deeper easy it's okay hang out here with this flavor this hit the light hang out with that for a bit more hang out with it hang out with it and then you can start that process so I would think that hang, out with that level right there a bit longer and I just boom okay now, P yeah that's that was the shift there was a, moment of the experience was more um more experiential it was more pure I guess in, the darkness and then that, helped the pump on the way up and through was ah okay thank you Chris uh um well he brought it up so let me we brought up downtime a long time ago just want to make sure people haven't uh misunderstood that down time forever and a day downtime say downtime is movement it's sort of natural it's in nature you know my tree had a downtime is starting to Blossom now uh but had a downtime but not forever in a day it brought it to another level and, boom now it's starting to Glow again starting to put new roots of roots buds out boom, so in that sense we're very similar uh so the downtime is yes a pause yes that in a certain way do nothing easy but it's trying to bring you some I don't know my words will be right I'm going to say them tries to bring you someplace it's trying to bring you to a location where in Chris's case he sees it as a bit of light that's his clue that he's reached that floor that's proper formers right there was easy to get to whatever, ah so the downtime is to bring you to a certain level and then come alive at that level, and then come alive at that level with our process boom, boom, let me see if I said that right ah yeah I just didn't want you to misunderstand downtime and not realize it was bringing you to a place where maybe not that first day maybe not the second, day depends how long this downtime is but it's not to get oh downtime uh downtime to touch something and when it's ready to go and you hit it again maybe this third day for example you hit it and boom that's the day where it wants to show the, next level of view Bo, Bing okay so I don't know just that you don't misunderstand down time and, that and, that's exactly what it was Sensei that was 10 days of thinking that like man say was I've got a month to go you know weeks are drifting by and, I'm getting worried and, then and then that one day it's like whoa okay there's something different about my process today and it was and it was nice on the way out see a pro at this I you get really, good at this uh when you're ready to cut your wrist how did Chris say it really worried yeah, not quite rised but yeah okay it's not that you don't worry you don't totally believe it yeah oh man this is a long one the results better be worth it I'm not nothing's happening and you keep at it and when it's time when you reach the right level boom yeah okay and it wasn't just the Sals it was the environment the situation around me like the job everything else vibrated hummed way better it was really yeah was great center circle, to the center yeah, it was it was a good it was a good, Liston uh if you notice I move my arm funny my shoulders are dinged again that's my that's my forever thing a lifetime of handing my arm for Shion nag to new people, for the Nik and they thr you down there uh so that was part of it but historical I always get it in the shoulders, so I have to play with that one day for fun, ah rotator cuffs are a pain you know why they're a pain you can't pour a bottle of, wine even two hands some a little trouble the bottle of wine now that's bad I can lift the glass on my left pretty easy but the pouring the bottle thank God CES WR CA pour me a glass of wine anyway where the hell are we, people we have any better sense of this better sense of downtime to get to a certain level boom and to be alert when you hit that level boom and if it's not clear to you uh then you hit it the next day you know or in that session that you're sitting with it you hit it over and over you know how long I don't know 5 minutes 15 30 I don't know whatever but not just once right I trust the system it didn't go away but there are things they want to show that maybe I don't know about yet this is something new so maybe May takes a bit longer what I liked about my, personal is not knowing I hate not knowing okay and I have periods of not knowing believe it or not I can have a day of not knowing not being able to figure out something I can have two days I don't like it two days of not knowing I don't like it okay but what I've learned is let's say on a two-day not knowing the third day it's oh I, suddenly realize experience a level in a way that hadn't before and oh this is pretty, cool right and I notice longer periods like let's say five days of not knowing oh God I really hate that okay you think you're losing it totally it's totally gone they'll never come back but you keep hanging in there and I noticed the five days five days periods when it cleared it was a big one uh what What's the words a big whoa a big experience a big Insight it, was well worth five days of me moaning and bitching because suddenly there was this real cool Insight okay so I, learned I still about it I don't like not knowing but I've learned how to ride with it knowing a bit better how it works and if that helps any uh when I was into bodybuilding exercising stuff I was always a lightweight and it was hard for me to gain weight and whenever I went on a you know this month I'm going to highlight gaining, weight almost as soon as I did that the scale would start to go down I'd lose a few pounds happen every damn time and then the weight would start to come on and, I'd increase my weight increase my muscle size uh but it always on those periods went down a little bit before it went up but once that happens a couple of times you got it down you, figure if it happens well of course it always happens that's the way it works whatever you live with it KN you lose a few pounds but then you go up to a gain of six lb yes cool wow six lbs six lbs whoa for a bodybuilder that's a lot of muscle, anyway uh anyway uh people okay we talked about the old basic enhancement factor using under okay now for some of you sometime, possibly there's this other thing that happens okay say from the under boom okay boom okay not a continuation of the pool process it won't be a lake and then a great leg and, then okay it's something its own boom so we'll call on Steve fman Steve who has been being bumed could I say by this could you tell us about that see where should we start settle an opening start kind of thing what were you doing when this showed itself when this happened yeah let me see if I can get back that you know some of the things you talked about from the last Workshop really um t me in, certain ways and that, sense that uh, of opening more giving space that, seemed to be very important to, Really and to take your time you know I mean there's a real tendency I want to get I want to get done with this and, get to the you know the pot of gold immediately but, that sense of soaking taking time so I would really um not rush through this uh as if okay I've done this I'm going to do that no give it time to be uh open with okay so you're doing let me jump in you're doing let me jump in you're doing your basic settling but you added on a bit more opening you remember from that day when something different happened okay, yeah and we just want to remind people notice that more space more room it's just a carryover from the one by to the two by to the three by but here it really, jumps more space really jumps and that's an internal not the space of Venus and Mars and wow and there's so many galaxies I'm not talking that space I'm talking the Inner Space of your inner finer dimensional world go ahead yeah and also you know not to get I was thinking of what you said a little bit earlier how you how you get pissed off when you don't know and, I you know that bumping quality it it's, easy to suddenly oh I'm suddenly thinking about my baseball team and, and instead of you know freaking out about it just okay and then come back once again taking my time not getting spooked by, being thrown off but coming back um and the sense I had is, there's, like a pipeline or, if you want to use a tree the trunk Going Down Deeper um there there's that and there you were you were you were sitting come on stay on target there you were you were sitting yes like a lot of depth tree trunk flavor right lot of space opening yeah and one of the things I mentioned to you uh that kind of comes to mind talking about this is that last scene in planets of the Planet of the Apes when uh suddenly this statue of libert emerges uh out of the sand well for me it, was a, a um I don't even want know how to find the right words but it was that golden, statue was there waiting for my discovery and, and by Discovery I don't mean oh I see it now but becoming that feeling that ex the sense of feeling there it was a lot of feeling of, uh this was different this was something, experential feeling people we need yes, because in my upper awareness I can kind of feel I have a body and I kind of feel what it's feel feeling but this again we have to change the words there de experiential feeling we, need a little different sense of it okay yeah and there's a sense of surprise as well you know not um where does this come from you know that out of nowhere yeah um okay so let me let me go over this a bit because don't want you to groove around when you talked about being bumped and thinking about your baseball team that sounds like something that happens to this guy he gets bumped by the uh the pond of energy right but I'm saying okay we're not talking about that how that works anymore we're saying sometimes some of you may have this experience it's big time where something goes W and is there okay now he gave you a good clue he said seems like more space more opening okay I think very cool that and then this thing was just there what' you say surprised you yeah, yeah and, that's not a good enough word because even a dimensional Bobby moving to Robert will be a bit surprised by Robert's uh experience in Robert's world so not your normal no basic person surprise it's like you walk up to the edge of the Grand Canyon whoa you know it's that kind of uh it's, jarring it's more than just a, minor surprise but it's coming you know when you're soaking it may be total darkness there's, it's as if there's nothing here to, latch on to and then suddenly out of nowhere here it here it is um what we're trying to do here and I got to keep saying what we're trying to do here is if this happens to you that well one thing you don't panic uh but you kind of can sort of remember some of the tricks here the more room and that it's okay when that big thing emerges big quality I'll call it it's energy of course people everything is energy uh but here I want to change from energy pools and energy PUD that have some qualities in there of course you know to enhance Bobby to Robert there's a little bit of qualities in there but this is Big Time something okay all right so we have to stop in a certain way we have to talk about it from this world because that's the world we're in right now but its experience and its happening is, otherworldly should we say have be careful the words it's, here it's now but it's whoa different and that's what I want him to say tell us the differences than a basic little a pool of energy underneath you okay clearly you know it touch something so basic when we talk about the, one and two uh qualities familiar I'm, I'm okay with them I'm I you know I, wear them, comfortably but, here it has such a profound uh impact and an emotional impact as well okay hold it right there now he got hit strongly with an emotional kind of reaction now I'm not going to say all of you will feel the emotional reaction I think you'll all pick it up pick it up different okay so his was an emotional reaction to this thing here okay yours will be yours go ahead sorry yeah, and my sense is this is a there's a feeling of this being a continual uh and a continual opening a continual, revealing that you know somebody was a minor and they, strike gold they're not going to stop there and say oh I found a piece of gold I want to see the mother here and keep digging yeah they want the motherload not a vean yeah so, again a good trick in the bigness of this you haven't seen everything about it experienced everything about it at that level but you continue opening so the more of it can show that it's there yeah, yeah good trick for everybody yeah it's, very inviting it really does my sense was it really it really does my sense was it really calls you back to want to want to come back to this because it, is I don't um is more than just um another enhancement yeah, yeah so uh it has a natural pull I, would say [Music], um and, wanting to wanting to know it because it's, it's me it's a it's uh you know not small me but it's normal me but you know it's related to you yeah that there's something past the Steve lineage something Pastor Bobby NAD lineage yeah now in his sorry in his case it's showing gold in okay Susan who I'll call in a couple of minutes uh to get her, example uh doesn't see a color yet okay uh so because he has a color I have a color with that with that one but Susan doesn't so you may have a color you may not have a color your color will probably be different than our colors or qualities or what okay all right so don't say oh I, don't have it yet because it doesn't have a color would be not right that's what I'm trying to give your a heads up on okay go got well another key thing that, I found so helpful when we were first talking about this third quality is, it's one that I, mean I can't say for everybody else but you seem to indicate it would be something that was neglected or, or um uh overlooked okay uh but maybe I want to detract that maybe I want to do that for this, guy but the three is so big it's not an everyday occurrence it's so fancy it's so Advanced could I say that I don't want to say we overlooked it uh if you are a normal human being it wasn't there for, you more advanced so let's not use that example please I, was thinking more that it would be something that since it's there it's always been there it's, not that it wasn't there before but it was rejected okay that may be a better way than overlooked so, this third thing this third quality has probably popped in a little bit little shoot through and I think that's what he's talking about he had a shoot through with this and he said ah and then as he hung out with it more and more he realized he did that in a past life or two n not, that so maybe it's been around for a long time saying hey and he bit the finger that said hey not now get away from me I got things to do here in my normal dumb world yes yeah, so gold color what else we need there you don't have the fullness of it yet but do you have any vague sense of maybe Arch type not sure if this is going to come out is there sort of a your sense right now if you're sort of open I I'll let you sort of Make Believe here for a moment is there going to be an art type character of that of that world of world of three you know it's funny because you would mention don't, necessarily think it's going to be male and, and when you just ask that you know what I mean, it, kind of reminded me of Venus de Milo in a Milo in a way I'm not sure if that's the fullness of it but it no of course it's not the fullness of it people yeah that's your first touch and you hang out, and you open some more and it clarifies so Venus may change her form a bit to show the clearer of herself kind of thing so don't stop short no there's more to be CLE down okay yeah well it's funny because I mentioned the thing from uh, Planet of the Apes the Statue of Liberty which in a way is come somewhat similar to, that let me explain what you're talking about okay when he first bumped into gold and so remind him, of his rejection as a young boy uh where his mom wanted him to be the Golden Boy and he said no, not me okay uh but then he stayed on this uh boy level I say okay what's the next level a man level whatever, but then I have to remind him also let's not get stuck on its mail uh first how you picked it up but be very open it may want to show it's a female force a female presence so that's what we're talking about yeah ah so anyway be ready to open more it's definitely male no question it's a male how do you know well because his first sense of it was a golden boy I don't know maybe but open up some more let it get clearer and clearer and it'll begin to show more trer what it is and if it's a male it'll be at your finest opening it'll be male if it isn't it'll change along and say well not really I'm really whatever female okay whatever yeah so that's I want to explain what we're talking about I don't want to run out of time so I'm think I'm finished with you did you cover it yeah the only thing I want to just say is, there's a, great excitement a great sense of POS possibility here um it's it, it really pulls you be pulls you in because it's, very enticing that, this gold you know this you've discovered gold that's exciting it's a big step along the way people St, but I want to remind you again don't jump and pass on basic practice that you have to do we all have to do basic practice to say well I'm going to Palace on that because I'm really a sharp guy and I'm very Advanced and I'm going to go just for three, uh it won't work well it won't work okay start to make believe what this is instead of it so continue your Basics when it's time uh remember the trick that he used being more open more open if as you're more open all you're getting is a, a, a better pool for the enhancement of your basic character hey why not you know Bobby to Robert to n to Sensei holy not a bad go around okay anyway don't jump and that's why I was leery of laying this out because you lay out something more finer and people jump for it they don't want to do the grun work don't know how to say that well but that's a bad tendency in the human uh or beings well let's say the humans right now of, of jumping yeah and I, would really caution you not to do that if it shows it shows if it presents itself it presents itself It presents itself I we're giving you a bit of a heads up by saying if you get bumped Heavy Duty buried different in a minor boom, boom from those guys you kind of know maybe what's happening but careful don't make up stories oh was that a bump was that the third quality oh have I arrived uh watch out for the stuff okay I don't we can't embedd in people in honesty Factor just pray God you have a personal honesty Factor okay thank you Steve on is suan she is yes I am good we're, eating up our time, you're let's start with there you are sitting settling opening and one day something happened boom you're on I was aett apprting a lot of similarities with uh Steve and his some of his descriptions but I would say the first time I experienced this was playing with space and really opening up space so again people there's two in a row more open more space really, seem to help okay go ahead CR critical I would say because if I'm too small this is gonna really push on me so I don't think this can show to somebody who's a one by one or a two by two let's continue to progress there went that class let's continue to progress with our Basics and again when if that happens it happens Susan go and the, patience is also really critical um just being willing to hang out with it and like you were talking about before it might show in a day it might, show in two days or three days but not looking for it just allowing it to show and being willing to hang out with, it and could we go over again its presence how do you know that, was very different than an increased pool puddle Lake whatever well because it's not a pool or a puddle or a lake it's more like an ocean okay all right but people can sort of track through this to an ocean so this one is [Music], different you know I heard Steve use the word profound yes it is profoundly different in the size and depth and power of it and that word has come up here before at first when this shows the, amount of power that it has everything's energy but this is a, biggie so it's going to show more than our normal qualities of our one two normal person uh so lot of power that's you'll we've heard it before we'll hear it again a lot of power now don't jump the gun don't say ah it's a it's a it's quality is power I'm not sure yet don't be so fast to jump the gun you can Note Power okay really was powerful yes okay but don't say and that is the quality we don't know that yet we hang out hang out experience soak let it unveil itself more and Susan I, don't yet have a clear sense of a quality or the quality uh I have a sense that it's on a healing lineage but I, would not at this point be able to describe or give it a, a name, yeah and then of course we being honest right, Susan yes knowing where she is in the healing, trade that yeah of course I would gravitate to that so yes and maybe but maybe not so don't let that oh it's going to be the great healer maybe but we don't know that don't screw it over don't, put your stamp on it, has its own presence what it is itself yes because it is very clearly different I, I know that it's me I know that it, is yeah it's me but it is clearly so different LEL it's a whole different game so again people are going to this try to have your own honesty Factor but we're just trying to give you a little heads up for if this were to happen you recognize it you open you work with it you soak with it whatever, whatever, okay and again in telling people too much oh Sensei was very good at not really talking clearly okay and it used wax poetically I call it uh which stuff people are trying to figure out now and I say a lot of it is like he was waxing poetically uh he said you'd have to say something so I would say da kind of thing uh we know the Alchemist had their own okay that there was a sense of to tell them too much they understand it the awareness is half mine whatever they understand it and they think they got it because they understand it and they don't got it I got it is when it's being experienced this way not I understand it I got it and in understanding it I can kind of feel something I'm experiencing it sorry, sorry this experience is from here damn the words this experience okay we're running out of time Susan one last raw RW you got something I think just U patience um for me is just being willing to hang out um and not know and trust that the more I open up this SP the more we'll show um yeah it's always a tendency to kind of want to know what it is yeah, and even if you knew what it was you're not going to be able to do anything with it it's all talk yes is you, can know a lot of about where o sentei was coming from when he was doing quote his magic iido and you can know all about it and you won't be able to do it we'll kick your ass on the map you're know he ain't going to do anything finishing up here people I, anyway I just wanted to make that clear that, under talk we used to use is yes for the enhancement factor it's a very good pattern very good very good but for some people this thing is starting to happen and I didn't want a confusion between that pattern and suddenly this unknown new as you heard them say they were like wow kind of thing uh it's different can we finish for tonight thank you so much Sensei thank you thanks for hanging hope you got something out of that thank you Sensei thank you sensei next session will be April 5th Friday April, 5 Friday got time to practice thank you everyone thank you Sensei thank you Bob thank you

## Enhancing the Character

**Date:** Unknown date  
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaCN8RW9PCA

hey Lauren, hi how are things I've had a good day yeah enjoying the pitter patter of the raindrops on my roof me too yeah it's been great you should get quite the you're, in the rain shadow right oh definitely yeah it's been pretty intense here this afternoon in fact I was and, it's very, painful um it's pretty horrible, and, yeah I sure hope it's worth it you're GNA have to dig deep to the energy support that's there deeper finer more original energy I kind of got a question related to that during the, first two weeks after the um I had the chemo but I really just couldn't find myself in that it was like there was a blanket over my, system my body and even just trying to feel my breath up and down it's was like what to going it did come it did after some time after some clean out thankfully but at the time, it I was quite traumatized by it all because it's always been a, go-to for me yeah and, um it was just like I was alienated from the Danny that on you let me let me play with that another time maybe next time we'll come back on that but let, let me play okay and get a better hit on that uh Susan you on is she in the mountains goofing off what she's here Sensei she's here I'm here sensei okay uh did you hear that from Danny we'll check that out yes I did okay yeah okay you got anything off the top on that or you want to hold that off till we check it out yeah we'll hold off okay all right I partner with her in certain medical research stuff so anyway okay look at that isn't that a beautiful diagram CA did yes basically okay the lineage we're on is just you basic character I would call that Bobby Robert not though basic character okay so we're not trying to uh at the at for this time we just do basic character as opposed to I want to be a better golfer I want to be a better, golfer I want to be a better parent I want to sell more whatever, or a better salesman whatever, or a better salesman whatever just basic character okay I think we're going to have to stand on this one [Music] stand there we go so first to be PR present okay oh I'm present I can see the room I see Brad I must be here I hear katcha I must be here the idea of it now the actual physical body character experiencing depending on where you're at might take some time to get out of your ideas it's okay whatever it takes you to settle using the first ground floor I think the one that's on the other diagram that's done up a black line will'll point it up later you're basic you're a normal human being, hopefully the first floor that you're standing on shouldn't be too hard to connect, with, now some days we're sort of little bit above the ground and we're can't quite get our footing and we're trip a little bit more often or I think maybe older people must be getting pushed a bit because they they're losing their ground contact I'll have to research that I'm approaching that um into that age as we speak, anyway present as an experience a feeling of being pra a feeling of being present again to distinguish between the idea of being present I understand I can I can spell present I know how to say it in, French the ex actual experience of being present here and now basic floor level basic Bic human being level tricks that help there again in this settling is a sense of opening because there's a lot of energies down deep come up strong you approach it too narrow they push you okay so first simple is in this settling a sense of an opening there is more room okay easy a sense of more room just a sense, experience again first I get an idea oh yeah we've touched on this before I know what he's talking about I'm glad you know now let's have a sense experience in opening feeling body feel body feels again lot of emphasis on the ground floor feeling so I'm feeling my feet my two feet on the floor and I'm noticing how flat they are uh do they feel kind of equal left and right, and left uh I'm just noticing through the experience isy body present basic floor level basic human being level so whether you're starting off as your Bobby or your Robert S M shows there, baby same once you have a feeling of a fairly full body present on, this floor you're feeling the body is feeling itself experiencing itself should be good enough as a starting, Place let's see oh one thing I'm noticing a little side here I'm noticing as I feel a little bit more settled so I'm going to the floor I'm going a little bit deeper than wherever I was uh before this session and start to feels more a few more aches in my body okay that's an example of some people not wanting to feel these but seems to be aches or pains or whatever and so they drift up and come back into a more uper, awareness so they're not in the body they're not feeling it as much okay so anyway a little sideline do that come across okay now I'm not going to ask you to go too very deep I use in this case under deeper under, deeper under floors but let's start with just an under platform keep it really simple so I'm not asking you to go too deep you've got your basic floor that my feet are on feeling and continue with that easy opening a bit of settling some sense of a little deeper that there's a platform there couple inches few inches underneath this basic wood floor here or basic rug a sense experience that you're touching it easy physical first floor easy bit deeper easy open bit deeper under basic floor platform floor let's call just a platform you have any sense experience that you're a bit deeper standing on a platform yet we checking my on the basic floor okay that checking experience there contining a little bit more open little bit deeper there's a underneath this is a platform floor okay and of course that could be a lot of awareness the idea am I there yet stuff like that of course but as you actually, practice okay we're going to do things fairly fast but really you got to practice okay, the platform floor has a little more energy it's a little bit of an energy pull and that energy, up L up and down back to the platform easy platform that has energy and there's a flow up and a flow down again if you're to hanger and play with this the flavor of the up flow and the flavor of the down flow they'll begin to show they're a bit different after a while again catch the difference between yes, Energy's up Yes Energy down I'm aware of that I can make believe that yes through the body the body that's here, basic opens up a little bit more to a platform now the energies from that level come up through the body down through the body but the energies are in here in here moving up and okay as they move up and down in one sense they're like a he and a, she okay and at first there may be Discord she doesn't trust him he's not sure what the hell to make of her okay but as you continue the actual practice by law if you don't interfere they will come to an accord inherent in the whole system of creation is a balance Factor they are trying to balance easy I'm just giving them room doing my best not to interfere that, comes up equally goes, down that, goes down equally comes up okay now following this sense that he and she or she and he basic sex comes into the picture here they'll want to in their Harmony level, breed or mix or produce find your own words, here go down and up, and down and, on this up this is where they're breeding and they're mixing up breeding birthing giving birth to a new level of me go up and down they're mixing breeding basic sex boom they're producing this, new kid on the Block this new baby so first I'm just a baby feeling again in this feeling now what do you have what's your experience that you didn't notice or have in our starting place for, example I feel stronger physically I feel a little, more physically present, Brad I feel more uh blimber and flexible and loose okay, and that would also infer a more flexible guy adjustable up and down, and up and I KN up mixing, breeding that level of character you one way to say this also is I say I started as Bobby here's the early beginning of a Robert still young but as I continue the pump he grows real fast won take him 20 304 years to grow it's real fast real fast but still take time to pump to pump to mix to mix to get this character it's a lot of feeling well character who am I don't go there this character body feeling we majoring feeling experience here, the, Outlook the awareness your Roberts Robert's intelligence compared to Bob's he views the world different don't worry too much about that at first let's get the character this guy this person this lady whoever you are okay I take a pause here he yeah oh hell I don't have any pens yeah Bob uh Steve here yeah what I found very help a few things that I found very helpful uh when I started out I, could feel the feet on the ground uh, first and then I started feeling a center line but then when you said open it suddenly got Fuller and what really helped was when you said you know your body may start to feel some aches and, as I opened more there was more aching which would have perhaps if I didn't know that thought it was a problem where, in fact it was just more energy coming inating yeah, that was that was very helpful for it's a simple one but you can see why the normal person doesn't go for anything of depth things happen like that go I'm gonna stop feeling and start thinking more I'm GNA drift more yeah because down there it hurts only for a little bit don't panic Jesus a lot of these things have been hidden so uh they have a lot of bad PR you know don't go deeper because you'll start to hurt more so nobody ever goes deeper kind of thing bad PR big misunderstanding okay, so we took some time up front to stand on the black line which represents basic floor basic human floor where I could feel my feet actually and I could compare them by the experience of them where they felt both there pully there whatever okay then we easy continue little more opening to get to this platform level this light shade of gray this, here saying okay now that, represents a little bit the next finer Dimension little bit not a major jump yet but a little bit and at that floor or support place there it has more energy and the energy going up and down through the system okay mixes breeds gives birth to a better level of character because I'm just doing uh lineage just personal uh I can say my Bobby went to the beginning of a Robert okay so, um oh there's pinch U okay so small move but there was a incremental Improvement on this physical body this physical body felt, a little, bit stronger little Fuller Brad's next was a little more pliable adaptable okay whatever you experienced should we ask what you experienced on our first practice run what was the Improvement of the body you character hello out there that was a question uh Sensei Bob here yeah my balance was better I'm sorry balance, physically my balance was better okay so this refined character a little bit more refined or what word we're using enhanced little more enhanced character better, balance, okay now there if a person wanted to practice a walking on the balance beam that would be a good level to start walking on the balance beam to get an unbalanced person to try to get balance on the balance beam might take too long I kind of said something important here get to a certain level to where your practice at that level is more rewarding I never said it quite that way that before did you catch that I think, yeah, well since I this is Lauren I think that you've talked a little bit to this in the sense of the 10 pound 20 pounder that you know sometimes you use the idea of a fishing line that if you've got five pound fish line don't expect to catch a 10 PB fish you know you want to catch 10 PB fish you need a 10 PB line you have to grow that you have to enhance your character let's get let's get to the 10 pound 10 pound let's say let's say this line is a 10 pound line let's get there first and then go fishing right, I think that's what you're saying is like don't jump up on the balance beam and then try to catch your balance become a balanced person then step up onto the beam don't enter the dojo because you've been busy looking at your computer all day and you're into mental thought major and you come to the dojo and you jump on the mat expecting you can do techniques there if you haven't settled a bit to got to get to a certain level you're wasting your time it's going to take you too, long you got to do half an hour warm-up techniques that's a little dig by the way uh and stuff it's much faster than that but it has to be done get to a better level and then we'll see okay yeah okay so uh so the energy up and down again you can we've done one time where we had one be male and the other be a female whichever you were choosing in your system and they were conversing with each other uh if you remember that at first they're not sure about each other they may have negative things you know uh to say about each, other uh but as you continue the practice give them more room they'll tend to begin to work it, out okay and they'll try to go into Harmony and balance where they're in agreement at that level they're in agreement we did that level an agreement, we did that level an agreement at that level and a sense of that balance, agreement when you know okay this is good enough level for where I am right now who am I or who is being produced who is giving birth how am I being enhanced my name ain't Bobby anymore I'm the beginning of Robert and you feel experience yourself okay Basics I hope I'm saying things a little bit clearer a little bit better okay what these lines here are as this guy improves after a bit not necessarily right now we're just doing a very early uh enhanced character very, beginning stage but as this guy continues that practice and works lines and deeper lines better character better character better, character as, the character gets better that's that, as he gets better or let's say the centered character gets better the circle or situation or world that you're in should also begin to activate to be in tandem in tandem with okay things should happen to NAD do in his world things should just happen Okay that don't happen in Bobby's World when I was a Bobby I would never get invited to Elin for God's sakes I had to develop myself to get to a certain level where suddenly these uh requests were coming in yeah I was practicing and doing little Homespun workshops you know just in my Dojo uh but expanding into past techniques into other stuff okay people begin to hear about it they started to spread the word okay and then people like Elin would say hey we heard you're doing some interesting work come, work with us let's see what you're up to hey we think that's great work we're going to contact the head Big Sur location tell them you're doing some great work boom I was in there they tested me out for a workshop or two make sure I wasn't a lot of going on in those years they would let anybody come in and do anything uh so they test you out for a couple of uh sessions to see if you were stable and if you had anything really to offer uh but as this guy progressed those things begin to happen is that is that clear um a good Poss possibility what's the word uh synchronicity Bobby would say gee that was a coincidence wasn't it after a bit because he's developing the world around him is starting to align and relate better Circle Center, Circle beat right now uh and things happen that are like in perfect timing to your character and you say whoa synchronicity yeah should be so should be so but that's why, it's happening because the character got better the world around you should get better your sense your view of the world around you see if I'm a Bobby and you say what do you think about the world bunch of screw them that comes up really easy for me as a weird Bobby if I settle I'll do a quickie someplace around on the Robert level hey what's your sense of the world h a little strange but I should do the best that I can in being calm with myself and balanced with myself hopefully that'll help with whatever craziness I'm involved in I got to take care myself and hope that helps with my family my immediate situation somebody's got to stay sane or calm, [Applause], or experientially present yeah are you following this let's, you chat for a bit, I laid out a fair amount what do you got to say s say this is Justin I really appreciate what you're sharing right now I, experience it to be so at a, finer level the, energies themselves are naturally more harmonious and balanced and clarify themselves and don't have to do a lot as a character but a character that's, open with a, Fuller and balanced up and a down and a depth and the balance and Harmony are naturally occurring at that level more obvious and available to the character and I in the situation was going through recently you know no I found myself walking out in the snow just to, be, present with it all and to you know not Drift But to son's Jack just feel let me let me jump in and say what I think you want to say real quick he was in a family bad situation death of a baby for Christ sakes uh he did, this Improvement of this character this internal beat work to he was at a much better level and he knew he could feel it with his family who are of course all broken up over the death of a baby for God's sakes but he knew by doing that and being that, they were being touched by that and affected by that it's true the world was changing in harmony response to the character and one of the greatest things about the fact that we've worked through this for so long is that the space was suddenly open it was just so big that the character responded to the space invited to the space open yeah under that pressure I didn't have to do a lot of process except to just stay there it was it pulled me into it okay but I could sustain better holy jump in again and he's talking about the reverse form which I don't know I don't think I'll have time to get into tonight but here we're working on improving this guy and I'm saying by the way this around you should also naturally improve show more possibilities whatever, there's another reverse way of doing this, where situation you work the situation first and in this bigger situation now who do I have to be and then you go from the situation, experience is that a good word here experience sense of and who do I have to be to be proper here and then the character gets his turn so here I say said character first and then this will start to kick in we can go the other way around and say oh the situation, I don't know what to do situation wait a minute situation there's a character here easy then you let the character develop our first, form to be equal to the situation that's a law center circle, Center but you can come at it either way okay my history is more of a center type and a little slow on catching the circle changes, uh oh Sensei was a center type a little slow on the circle uh at first um so is that are we are we on track 100% And you know I, I thought of ensei quite a, bit um that, my grandson's passing is not exactly like ensei on the battlefield although when he he's on the battlefield and there is bullets flying I imagine in a similar way that situation pulled him into the character of performing at the level that he was a more advanced AA yeah, so kind of like that but not of the same magnitude I, felt, yeah, he said something to me about at that time he had a sense of bullets flying around sure I can't quite recall exactly how he said that but maybe uh oh too many bullets over there I think I'll stay over here which later he got more advanced and he could feel the bullet actually coming at him at which time he go oh it would go by so his earlier level of being aware of bullet flying to this other level where not only aware but aware if they're coming at him you see, something an energy something that told them here, it comes yes so are we okay there blah, blah okay again practice, okay oh yeah I know that we, did that some years back I, remember I'm sorry people you're not practicing it's memory unless you're practicing, it's like reading one of Arnold's books on, bodybuilding and you think you're going to get muscles reading the book no you're going to learn some things but you ain't got no muscles nothing's happening you got to exercise I know the mind is fast but it can't create the actual that's just a part of it isn't this a nice part if we use it right I get an idea and then I say okay the rest of the system what do you think do you want to play with this and if it starts to activate I can sort of hear it say yes, that's that that's cool we'll develop if we do that so that idea I just don't stay there and expect it to do everything it's the beginning that's like this part but now I got all of this part to do okay and people are fairly well versed because that's sort of the humans Norm been the norm for thousands and thousands of years to be more this style and the depths here and how that works has really been hidden shrouded kind of a secret well Sally tried to Mainline on this he told me there's plenty of these type of teachers spiritual mental finer but because they're going to find themselves lacking Believe It or Not eventually believe it or not we need this Fuller and there's where sense I said God they got to catch on to this so even, these floors here going down a bit deeper mixing up a better character from that level ensei would say why do you think I taught them SW waza why do you think they knew when they saw me they better go SWAT waza or I would hoping, that in sitting on the floor and settling they would catch this now the fine tuning of that he probably didn't teach him but that's basically what he was trying to get him to do sit on the floor, settle and now you figure it out, okay so some of them sat settled learn to walk around on their knees maybe be real spiffy on their knees did they realize what, they were into under here probably not because you didn't get any moreal senses after that or any understanding about this but he introduced it to him that's it do some techniques from here hoping you'll touch more energy and realize oh you feel different did you go huh what the hell is that about what if I were to go deeper and open and, mix from there, gee what if I were to go even deeper finer Dimensions under so he didn't clarify that as far as I know I'm sure he didn't he's offensive but that's, why s Wasa to start this game going for the Nik as we walk around on our knees doing techniques that's all that, means okay talk to me where are we where are we I say clear Danny here um thank you for highlighting that we could um reverse the process yeah because I'm very much Center and as I said before that's what I was looking for through the pain and the whatever but I never gave it a chance I never, gave the circle any chance whatsoever I just kind of freaked out way guess um was overcome with bit of grief I grief I think yeah so yeah again I'm gonna have to fine-tune this with Susan to, jump with the details yeah but yeah but yeah well just anyway just to know that uh there two starting Styles one is situation, situation, situation uh Autumn situation is like the, script that's the situation and you read the script huh yeah okay then you got to do the character what are they asking for with this script situation who does the character have to be and that should be an experience not just mentally going over it CU then you'll be a lousy actor yeah sure um can I ask when you're are working on um character in the same way that you have say a um more original Self can you have a more original character uh okay wait original Self okay I wasn't going to get into self yet but would say again what you just said so if you have this character that's refining and refining and finding it's coming to a more original character right yes eventually yes, at the same time that's creating kind of a more original Self because they have to remain yeah it's not so I'm not sure if I want to say it's creating an original Self there is already an original Self oh boy oh boy you're going to catch me off guard here uh a after we do a few of these Bobby probably can't pick up that there's a self Robert I don't know maybe, H but as it's Fuller, here a fuller experience then the sense of self there's something here that's you but it's not a character's mind it's not a character thinking self is a separate unit related to you it's yourself I I'm not sure what to say because I know there are some selves in the universe that aren't that welld developed they're selves but they're not that will develop so I'm not sure how to how to word this uh let's say the amount of Self in the universe we're is still a very good guide on it knows a hell of a lot more about me than Bobby does than Robert does then Ado does then Sensei does it's really pretty sharp, okay but that's a whole different thing I want we'll, get into that I want to go back on self and, and get a better communication beat going with, it I've been practicing on my front por with this uh but not tonight and maybe not next Workshop but soon but my question is yes okay go as you continue to refine the character is the self doing that at the same, time or they to be it can guide better it can guide better the self can guide the character better, yeah character gets better and then again you're getting me into this next Workshop damn you uh so where am I where am I at uh as self as character gets better let's say it's more of a NAD or NAD Sensei I can still say to the self hey self I would like to continue to progress suggest something show me something give me a hand here so I character can continue my progression easy and then the self should I'm more clear with it after a bit uh communicate with me what I should do as character what is there for me in qualities that I can mix up better and be a better character does that cover it or did I go offline again no that's, really great there will be kind of a communication between the two yes and that's a Workshop I want to do separate from tonight looking forward to it better communication yeah thank you but I have to say something because you sort of brought it up about uh people trying to catch self when they haven't practiced, sitting or shifting being a better character uh it's like what is a self you know me that's n, do self no, not do n do but there's a self there uh but until you've sat and got to a better level self may not be able to show again you're sucking me into this no we'll talk about self another time thank, you, uh but anyway just for acting just that basic uh you read the script fine but then you start doing this practice here are you just trading your personal in for you're clearing for the character to get mix actors should be very great at that if they're really good they're good at this that they can clear it's not personal anymore and they just say this character and the energies up and down will begin to mix that character that character more fully after a while her the bones of the character show its that character the, voice of the charact is that charact the little mannerisms are that character you don't have to make believe them it's that character being itself so a good actor gives room or clears the decks to be able to play this game and the system loves this game by the way did I say anything intelligent there that okay yeah, that was good yeah so I bring up dumb stories like I heard more than once oh gee I like to act but I but I hope dear God I don't have to act a bad character because I really can't do a bad character uh see they're confusing their Char their, character their personal character with the energies for the for the acting character and so a bad character is necessary the personal character me, uh feels this Badness and goes oh no I can't do that they didn't clear enough a good actor should be able to just clear all my personal stuff and I'm just making room for the character that the, director wants the script is calling for boom here it comes I, hope I said that clearly that's really the essence there people before I get too crazy lost over here where are we Sensei I was just going to say from this practice it um just from the initial feeling of what we were just uh doing a little while ago I could feel it into my feet kind of the, grounding into my feet and it reminded me of um two events the first one was practicing in the dojo practicing iido in the dojo and feeling a technique not from just making contact with my UK but then feeling my feet how deep am I feeling into the ground and I had a, similar thing this morning where I had um uh Elementary School where I teach music at the whole school was there and naturally when you have an entire school performance there's a lot more energy involved and I could feel energy kind of getting I could feel my knees getting weak you know that feeling of that but then when I and then I also noticed when the principal said sorry parents we don't have enough seats then I noticed there were more parents whoa now I could really feel it but then when I kind of clicked into that first line and then felt it into my feet then I knew I could I kind of surrounded the whole okay there, is the situation got bigger and bigger okay he's well aware of it he, can feel the of that situation now I'd like to add to his thing of centering down to the ground very good but now, let's take advantage of how it works more centered down to the ground to tap a deeper pool of energy that'll mix up you character equal to the situation so you saved your ass by grounding that really helped but you can do so much more here with just this little extra down up and down and up I am the character of this event and again later you'll be able to get there Fuller faster but at First Take it more than a few minutes yeah but, to play it Fuller you did a good job and you didn't get too bold over but you can do an even better job and whatever you character in that situation with a better mix a better enhancement much better yeah, yeah and I want to go back to Gina, I thought I saw you you're on aren't you yeah then when you use the back and forth for balancing and it's as soon as they felt balance you felt the center he said whoa and when you felt the center you said you really feel good on stage okay I want to add to that one great, great but now let's take advantage of this and the centered one down deeper up and down energy beats breeding wow she on stage let's go a little bit more okay so he did a beautiful piece of work with back and forth and Center he did a good piece of work with Don't Panic here in the panic situation be centered and go a little bit deeper on that beautiful piece of work but there's a little bit more yeah got it Gina okay good, um and I talk for a bit talk, a bit somebody uh sense Bob here Bob here you had a phrase that you used over many years that I always found helpful in terms of working to the process kind of in ultimately in both directions uh from, Center and from Circle and that is I'm in my world and my world is in me oh yeah that's cute huh and just repeating that helps to get things started yeah it's cute yeah it's cute again haven't used that for many, many, years but I like it yeah ear the Potted Plant Theory doing this right the plant is equal to the pot the pot one fully feeds or it's fully there with the plant there's a there's a much better reciprocity much better Harmony between those two yeah see those, are big two we're starting off with the simpler two now watch out for the word simpler doesn't mean you should be disregarded these are your starting basics of just up and down and that breathes later when you catch wait a minute there's a circle here then you can go Center up and down better character now checking the Circle H and feeling more equal to it or vice versa circle to the center you do it that way also uh and there's your Harmony but at a much bigger level so as you continue the work into finer more original okay we do finer, finer for a bit after a bit you have to change the words some more original I'll explain that one day in the far future but that sense of more original okay when you say who am I you're really trying to backtrack I'm Bobby yeah but before that who am I suddenly there's a Robert after a while okay I'm a robbert and I feel pretty good but who am I so I, have this constant inquiry I'm, sort of nagged or I nag myself or something uh that wherever I'm at is not quite good enough historically when people have ever complimented me a certain way whoa you're great I say it's not good enough and they go but, but you're great not for, me this deeper inquiry Who Am, I really that should go on and on and on and, on long time here it's Big Time stuff oh I'm drifting here people talk to me somebody say something before I get go mad here s it's Justin I've got just something practical that came up for me while we were working together in the standing practice the fir my first basic brought up some discomfort in my body the feedback in my body symptoms I call feedback uncomfortable but as we settled into a deeper and the flow was there the discomfort began to go away and the feedback was there physical the character body was less uncomfortable and that was evidence for me through that feedback that I was present with the flow in a way that produced a feedback of comfortable rather than uncomfortable yeah, so it's if we were smarter as human beings as soon as we uh start to feel uncomfortable we would immediately know oh more energy wants to show oh okay sorry I didn't notice you, rang the doorbell but I, was listening to my TV here with my ear whatever uh but oh now I notice you're here because I'm getting more uncomfortable give me a moment I settle I open I say hi what's up welcome what's up for today boom easy and let it and let it and let and let it and let it and let it okay and again I take a the character approach first and, what's it doing for me character me character and then as a better character, and then as a better character might be now check the world you're in at this level and I see things in my world I didn't notice before or something so whichever way you go yeah this switching back and forth is fine you know if I if I say male female sometimes I do female male center circle, circle Center yeah that's, that helps you move along it just helps be faster balanced or something yeah and eventually some of the doing that might be a little hard might be hard for say a heavyduty male to really allow big female force that could be scary for a lot of guys if I remember my first sense of a lot of female energy quality I felt weaker well I'm Macho Man at this time to feel weaker is like no I don't want to go there I've been working my whole life to get stronger capable I'm a martial artist or whatever I'm a bodybuilder I got muscles so your first, intro on a lot of qualities could confuse you like pain discomfort oh it must be bad I'm going to run from it no it's all energy it's present showing wants to say something, hey I'll open up talk to me I know you're a buddy of mine and I know how you want to mix and mix me up better and so my world is clearer to me and my world just mixed up in there and da, do da yeah, help somebody where are we Sensei te you here T hey you remember maybe back in the 90s the 90s um I had a I had a big record release party in San Francisco at the Great American Music Hall and you, came for that event I really appreci is that the one you were on stage playing yeah, of course yeah with, the viol yeah, I remember that so and there so in relationship to the theme tonight of enhancing the character there's was an important thing that happened um as you came down before the show uh backstage and we were kind of you know getting ready and so on and say and I said something like well I'm, really feeling the Butterflies I'm really feeling the, anxiousness uh that, performers sometimes, have on particularly big shows and this was a record release party and it was a you know was big deal so and what you invited me to, experience then was don't fight that invite that don't fight it invite it and so when I was able to actually breathe with that sense of the an this my mind saying that was anxiety what I was actually getting was more energy it was more energy that I needed to be who I wanted to be on stage to express the things I express through music so it was a it was a big it was a big lesson yeah and in, connecting with the, energies that are sometimes there that we think oh I shouldn't be feeling this how can I I'm going to clam up I'm going to clutch so in connecting with that in that greater fullness rather than pushing it away inviting it uh gave me a chance to uh to incorporate what that what that energy really was which is more yeah more life more Vitality in the background there beneath everything it was breeding a more enhanced character who had more energy yes which gives you more glow on stage gives you better hearing because you're were playing with somebody else yeah gives you more uh oh you were guitaring uh gives you better flexibility dexterity whatever you don't miss a string or whatever you all of that yeah you have to be relaxed you can't be contracted in those in those times no Bobby in his one by one has got it easy and open yeah if you want to get to a 2 by two Robert or a 3 by3 n whatever yeah, yeah one other one other interesting point on that I really took that lesson to heart and have used it in, life since then the important thing is what you emphasized earlier is practicing with that so you're not always going to be in front of a on a stage with hundreds of people in the press and everybody being there but what you can do is in your practice is you can kind of feel or it's not exactly imagine but you kind of presence that, that situation and that situation kicks up that juice yeah and so you practice with that yeah so um so when I'm practicing on my own I don't just it's not just in my bedroom practicing guitar it's like I'm practicing here for Carnegie Hall or Great American or whatever yeah, U I'm trying to reward that uh yeah if somebody says gee that kind of situation really throws me yeah, and you say okay if you want to practice then imagine that situation yeah get some details there whatever really imagine it okay and a lot of people probably won't even want to do that part because as soon as they really begin to imagine it with any feeling right yeah they're already starting to get the energies the butterflies or whatever yeah or whatever yeah uh but this is the beginning of practicing here in this situation easy now easy and open and the energies that are coming up easy well still grabbing my tummy I don't know if I feel comfortable yet that's okay easy settle open double check the Imagine situation that usually throws, you easy settle open now we're doing this practice yeah and if they were to actually practice and open the energies have to balance and produce a more enhanced character who will be comfortable or capable in that situation but they got to practice gotta practice yeah you just can't oh I understand you know you just can't do it that way, right practice, thank you for that thank you thank you uh so uh so anyway the next levels are basically the same thing let, me let's, check them out for a moment oh okay, we got our basic floor let's double check it double checking that first basic floor feet on ground body feeling yeah, yeah body feeling feet on the ground okay now we had a little platform floor underneath good easy set open platform referencing it again sort of checking it for a moment or two here and if you remember we touched this platform and we felt a little more better, enhanced okay so in going deeper shouldn't be hopefully too fearful when I did one I felt bit better enhanced okay then let's go a little bit deeper to that second floor easy second floor easy hopefully in a distinct way it'll show when you're there okay I'm getting a little bright me my what's happening to me at the moment uh little bright light at that floor but it still feels lower than me I think that bright light ought to be more here s of a hot up bright light kind of thing but anyway in some way there should be some sensed experience letting you know you're at that, floor I think so another way of showing is my left and right spread which I didn't have with the platform set but this is spreading Out Left Right more is there okay you see I think so okay now that's a much bigger pool of energy if the first one was a puddle this is at least a pond okay using that pushed and from there the energies flow up through the system up and down easy at first it's semi make believe you don't feel anything fine it's okay easy from that floor again energy flowing I know it got better because the up and down felt smoother easy from that deeper flow a pond of energies up and down and mixing, breathing giving birth to the enhanced character feeling don't shift in the think is too soon feeling experience inner in inner I feel more physically proportioned more important or as important I'm feeling more a little bit of a heart radiation depending on what situation I in as a warrior I feel more I have heart to be a warrior another situation i' have heart to be more caring now and again we only did for a moment you'd really have to repeat and repeat and repeat so touching a floor up and down to represent the two forces and some place when you think good enough let's give it a shot up and down and up mixing breeding the characters giving birth to who am I now as an experience gee who should I be who would I like to be don't go there you've lost it experience sense of okay and as you practice put time in uh your settling will get will get faster uh the ability of going deeper will get easier remember to open sense of finer Dimension infer that there uh could you keep going deep, on and narrow could be kind of icky at first that's where that oh it's a monster under there I don't like I don't like that coming up now Bob yeah here yeah one thing I noticed being a more Center uh type uh that as I went deeper if felt like not only did the character become stronger more, enhanced but more uh confident in the situation the, what whatever was around me I was embracing that more yeah oh your re your form what I felt with my heart as a warrior kind of thing that that's your form so it wasn't hard uh but it's very similar I can oh yeah, I can relate to him that is similar kind of thing yeah [Music] yeah so you were enhanced yeah not only yes, not only enhance but embracing my, my uh situation more yeah and again when you get this character fairly full you know he's young at first but as you hang out and keep practicing not just one minute you know two minutes three minutes four minut keep practicing and then eventually, what's my sense of the world who would you Embrace or include at that level might be a question oh I, feel like I can Embrace more or what's going on in my world that I should embrace easy and let that show to you easy and, something will show yeah whether you different ways you'll pick that you'll sense it you'll, pick that you'll sense it you'll be fre for because you think you're maybe making it up uh that's why the ones that surprise you are cool because you didn't make it up it surprised you yes it's there and it's letting itself out so it can talk or show in different forms sometimes I hear things inside and I don't I hear cot in the kitchen I don't mean that inside I hear or I get images that come from, this or I just get a sense can't prove anything but there's a sense that, it's that I should embrace or whatever just a sense okay so different forms for different people at different times yeah hey goodness we're eating up time um so anyway spend time experience the, character especially at first when character first gets birth don't say well who Am I who should I be don't go there don't go there you lose it all right the character needs time to develop again like a baby to a child to a teenager to it's a little faster here but still that same flavor it needs time to get fully there okay if you don't do that and you just have an idea about this character uh you can't sustain very long it doesn't take much to bump you off if your character is a nice guy and somebody walks by and says hey you'll fall apart because the idea of it doesn't have enough you need the other part of things the character part to sustain to have longevity did I say that well very, important people I think we ate up our time any here asked question if I lost you didn't clarify good enough since I'll add my own experience in that this kind of training has been the most valuable aspect of iido training for me over many decades because this is the training that facilitates rising to the occasion whatever that occasion might be and sometimes had to had to rise the occasion very quickly oh yeah, if we practice it gets damn fat oh sense it was unbelievably fast from this old man to this who the hell is that presence was fast but you got to go through you got to practice you got to spend time but it will get faster it will get easier but you gotta you gotta practice Yeah cat off the other aspect is that who is the character that rises to the occasion that also overtime becomes, enhanced or is the course is ongoing yeah after Robert there's n after n do there's Sensei after Sensei there's whoever after him there's whoever continues we ain't finished people if you want to finish finished people if you want to finish that's, fine because at least you got the first enhancement if you're if you're down a little bit don't have to be you can do a little process sort of be okay and sort of normal hey great you want to quit there fine it's a lot better than you being this way I'll yeah I'm yeah go ahead I cut you again well just that with the this aspect of practice in my own experience not only over time does it get faster the transition or the dimensionality of it but that the person that emerges the character that emerges is uh inh more capable for that situation, so it's a it's, I'm just trying to say that you know it's not just for musicians it's no, no, no it isn't just for musicians I'd be at the musical School saying where's the Sensei of this school it's for everybody in anything I always make a joke selling some of the spiritual people think selling candles and incense is okay to do that secondhand cars no, those are that's bad and those are probably bad people we don't sell secondhand cars we sell incense and candles because we're spiritual excuse me but what total is that anything done from a finer level will reach its Perfection or its beauty or its Harmony I mean we do martial arts for Christ sakes look at the beginning of martial arts two guys in front of their caves throwing rocks at each other and when guy practices a little bit more he's able to hit the other guy more often the other guy says what the hell I'm going to practice and he practic he practic it there's the beginning of martial arts Suddenly It's this thing of Harmony potential this thing of nurturing other people potential that's the development of Martial artarts so to say martial arts are bad, bad I don't think so what level are you doing a math if you're punching out the local drunks to show how strong you are that's not quite acceptable he's so drunk he can't fight back or he's so crippled he can't fight back what are you doing beating him up oh but look how tough I am I can beat up this, that's a little strange but dimensionally he can move finer and finer till he wouldn't beat up the he'd help him across the street whatever, whatever know we're running out of time oh I hope we covered some things hope I said it a little bit different ah practice, practice catch you later thank you Sensei thank you thanks Sensei good session thank you Sensei, good session thank you Sensei thank you sensei thank you Lauren thank you everyone thank you thank you

## Easy the I: A Way to Self

so fundamental for him and then stepping through the travel vehicle of, character the Bobby Robert NAD seet and seeing that as a pathway or as a way to access or become more, uh sensitive to your original Self and that, requires at a certain point not attaching too strongly to these characters that you've sort of uh recognized in yourself all right so we all have these multiple, characters depending upon the situation and we can get really attached to them this, is who I am this is what I do this is who I am this is what I do and what Sensei is saying is that this, progression gives us more visibility more access to experience our original Self but that, requires us too to not hold on too tightly to the characters of our, own characters that we recognize our self-identity right so it's subtle stuff and I certainly can't explain it very well but uh that's what he we talked about when we came up with the theme for tonight and um you know I as always uh you, know your feedback and your questions and your comments are what really steers the conversation and what sense they thrives on so uh if, you don't have a question ask your other self so I think he'll be here just a momentarily few more people are still coming in well certainly is a live crowd Lively crowd everybody's fully muted can't hear you sass you're speaking but we can't you I'm just soundchecking you got me right got you Richard is Bob close does anyone know Bob is close I'm here Bob is [Music] here there is Bob good evening good evening okay see Teach is out tonight, um is Autumn on autumn, yes she is yeah I'm here oh I heard you're on the sick list but you're here yeah I've got the co yeah I told you to stay out of airports didn't, I yeah that's what they say oh okay yeah well uh you had some great question the way you were heading last, time uh so we'll pick up on that after a bit stay alert I'll call on you copy that okay uh, just to warm up a little bit Ah what did we do last time somebody give us a quick what we do last time uh two weeks ago we talked about enhancing the character ah with the third quality is that what this one is yes yeah yes exactly okay so people you've had a couple of weeks there to play and process and uh any, comments about the last sessions work you've had so much experience now tell me about it oh Carl no one's going to jump I guess I I'll, start off our conversation it's Justin uh been working with the down and up full down full up balancing the down and the up and settling into different levels of down slow and, calling something you, brought to the table some weeks back about using that a moment to sort of pause as, you're as you're coming up to, kind of kind of like a, slow, half beat on the up or down to gain a sense of like solid core power there in that balance moment between full down and up at a level feeling and feeling experiencing a deeper level two I really just gone one and full two up down but, pausing and hanging in the in the Core Balance for a moment all, okay couple of things there one thing I'm doing with a balance is I'm playing balance as a he and a she breeding okay so if you use uh whatever form you're using in and out or up and down depends if your circular type or Center type at first uh that you get more balanced and the balance now breeds mixes a better character so the extra beats that I'm using so you did your up and down got a certain level of balance fine and now one more and this is because of the up and down there is, a, character being bred the new baby here uh Robert as opposed to Bobby and up and down and the more the Fuller of the character being here although he's still a young child for a while you have to pump him a bit and he grows real fast uh but that's how I use that extra count on, that beat so it's not just more up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down someplace I say at this level of up and down or in and out now the character feeling the up and down and being the character so maybe a little bit different than you s of presented yeah you understood the little angle I put on that yes I did thank you thank you sense I really love that, there's, a moment to sort of pause and soak at that, level well you're being bred give birth to yourself yeah as opposed to that's my mommy that's my daddy that's my mommy, that's my daddy that's my mommy that's my daddy that's my mommy that's, my daddy that's my mommy that's, good that's good now they're sort of holding hands or something okay a certain, level of Harmony between them now bing, bing, starts the sex act bear with me people it's n Talk being and up and down and here I am you saying, yeah, anyway ah thank you thank you Sensei yeah thank you oh boy um also I want to H do I want to bring it up now uh what I want to do might make might fit in here is yes up and down or in and out depends which style you're you using let's stay with the in up, and down my first favorite style because I'm a centered type uh that I get enough balance pretty good level and okay Robert not Robert not whatever and then I want to go to the Underworld the underworld and start to tap a different quality so I've got my up and down or I got sorry bad I've got my two qualities as a normal human being so whether you're in and out you get say two qualities normal human being okay but in this under world that people are often leery of there is the source of a third quality so I want to start to mix up a, a threez instead of a two Z's two qualities but I want to get that third one in there don't know if I should bring be bringing that up now maybe I'm just lost tonight please continue sense huh please continue on the idea has three qualities third quality yeah third quality the sort of for most people the, quality that they Haven been connected with well we'll go over a couple of stories here how other people talk uh let's see got to watch my timing know where am I bing, bing, bear with me I may be a little confused tonight so much going on over here in my universe anyway uh, Noah you're on right yes that's it okay I think we a cover two, things here uh go over that story where you a normal two quality person basic Robert Noah okay, and you went into the underworld a bit yes right cuz you heard that there's another quality there yes okay go ahead when it began to show up it showed up as a negative initially yes that's a fear of the underworld and how it first appears good go it felt kind of like a um sort of like an oily kind of sludgy material trying to come up in my system which initially was not a desirable experience right so people don't want to hang out with the underworld because for many at first it's like Ah that's icky stuff monster, territory, okay go okay go ahead but knowing that, was not the case uh based on our training over the years uh I contined to invite a in and it began to get uh smoother and have some nutrient qualities to it as well as expanding this the size of the space okay, so uh so uh basically in his settling he was opening having a sense of moving into a finer, Dimension okay where that, was oily and icky can show its true colors where it started to be what would you say beneficial what, nicer began to feel like it could lubricate parts of the system and feed parts of the system yeah okay so being fed being lubricated hey that's not bad I'll allow that so in allowing that quality that third quality you got your first two Basics Robert Noah and here's this third one you dealt with the underworld pretty good so far okay uh and here's this third quality and it's beginning to mix so all three qualities are now mixing it's, going to be and then I call it enhanced it's good phrase enhanced Robert Noah with this third quality and that makes now what do you got or who are you is that I'm a person who's not afraid to be seen and to shine okay so if one has been a little too shy or holding back suddenly it's okay, to be here it's okay to be seen it's okay to be heard kind of thing yeah yes could you give a another name to that character he who shines as a but person who isn't, afraid to express his truth clearly and uh specifically okay see where are we here are we okay so far okay and, then here as he starting to get a flavor for this third quality and playing with it and mixing and being okay yes then he starts to get a storyline an image some sense uh that this quality has been here before historically past lives and he passed on those qualities then, correct going over the reason this was late in the game is because historically you sort of held it down so you got your first earlier two that are easy make up Robert Noah uh but this one has been held down historically and you gave it a chance to show it was there beginning to catch the real benevolence of it the enhancement of it whatever word you want to use there and your stories that appeared right there historical stories yes that's right past lives that's right yeah one was of a, monk in Italy in the 12th century and I began to have certain capabilities especially with healing that attracted people's attention and I wasn't going to go for that all right so there it was it was held down and there was another one another show to two lives I think another one later on uh where I was like kind of like a squire to a night you know so you're like cleaning the horse and the armor and you know whatever I don't know what Squires do but whatever and so the other Knight said you know you could be a knight and I said no I, can't do that I'm not night where I'm heading here is that I'm saying the self is starting to show here and show more about him bringing up here's a couple of examples of when you pass on that quality historically and why you passed or, whatever uh so the self is there trying to guide Robert Noah into being Sir Robert Noah or whatever okay so the self is there and has the memory the retention of all those previous lives okay and is a guide on um a on um a mentor some other words I forget right now uh to facilitate characters developing as characters develop self continues to be able to show the more of itself and so they start to work in tandem better self better character potential if you exercise and pump the pump and stuff or mix the mix or whatever and be the character self is better character is better character is better self is better is that did I say that okay did I time that out right yes Sensei one example of, why you're right is at least going from being a to a night I was a squire rather I was out in the world interacting with people where before I wasn't even doing that yeah also we get a better sense you had another life we talked about this many years ago uh temp Templar, night Templar you were a night Templar you can see the kind of com combination here with this that's, right kind of a history historical pattern for not that he didn't have other kinds of lives but you see it's sort of a pattern oh there was a night Templar oh, anyway ah and uh Autumn we may have touched on your question with parts of that, this better the character the better self but I'll don't jump in yet I'll check back with you soon but I think you started to bring that up uh okay where are we uh people are you okay with Noah's story I thought I thought it laid out fairly well did I did I hear it right did you hear it y all okay with that any questions about that about that process I, sense say it's Dy go I have a question I think it's kind of similar to what other people have said but like I Wasing working on that two beats uh before Christmas when we you did it and one of the qualities that I kind of go back to I don't know if it's like a form a main for quality but I, get a lot of anger so um I have a chance to practice it one of the things that gets me angry is I like to be on time so one of the people are late like making me late I get angry so I was like okay you know just relax what else is there and what came to me was strength yeah there's a strength below that and so I've been sitting there with that for a couple weeks but I just wondering like well when do I know to like go to the third another stage or mix something else in there like once uh I would keep developing the first one then you get a little bit of it and then you move on to another one and you might move too fast yeah you, I, heard you say that to me right away with strength I was like just sit with that for a while so now I've been doing that but and let's, word so anger I told you my story you forgot already people you forget too soon I'm an angry type I told you about my t-shirt vulture saying to another vulture I'm bored let's go out and kill something and I love that t-shirt probably still in my drawer someplace I love it never wear it but I love it ah and I said I, can't live my life with this kind of potential anger you know I am going to kill somebody and I don't want to go to jail whatever I'm too handsome remember uh so I sat with it and I sat with it and I opened and I sat with it and it went through all the series it's fiery oh yeah fiery that's why cartoonist would do a fiery thing when somebody's getting angry okay and on and on and on and as I continued uh it wasn't angry the I got to a place of where was just power but it had no agenda to hurt any but it was just power and if I had continued into finer Dimensions it would have shown power and it would show you know something nicer to really balance it out beautiful so that's the pattern uh so to stay with something into finer and finer for a while I don't know if there's a set rule you got to do you know a year on that one and then a year on the next one I, I don't know if there's a pattern but I'm, worried about you jumping here and jumping there just getting a little piece of it and jumping a little fast I stay with one for a while and really once you get the fullness of one then when a different one comes in you kind of have a sense of how to get to the Fuller of that one yeah, if you just do a little bit of this one and next one comes in you do a little bit next one yeah, but, it's, bigger it's Fuller there's more of each one of those is all I'm trying to say okay yeah but good work sounds like yeah, and we'll fit the time in and uh the why time shortness of time irks you uh but I don't want to go into that right now if that's okay another time ah where are we okay what about Steve okay oh what caught me on for what caught me on Bob's layout something I've been melling on anyway for a bit is with this third quality I'm saying two qualities are basic, Mr Noah basic Bobby Robert Noto whatever basic, Bobby Robert Noto whatever basic okay start to touch a third quality and include that in the game and right there uh in Bob's case suddenly there's past lives very clearly explaining things they say Ah that's the self, is the carries all the history has access to all of that knows you very well because it's always been there okay where am I going where am I going okay that the self came in okay now let's shift Steve I talk to you for a moment today yeah, and, repeat your story here well some of it really connects with what Bob was talking about um I haven't yet tapped the past life at aspects of it but, early childhood aspects okay start the story from the beginning you're sitting there what are you playing with okay so, I'm playing with going deeper going underneath the dark uh and, going through all that which I've always been fairly comfortable with but it's you know you still have to hang out with it and, go through it and I was getting not, as clear as say this the other more accessible uh qualities but, it was something that was glowing that was almost like I'd see a trophy something like I was a champion I victorious let me let me slow you down so in settling in the Underworld he went through some dark you didn't say that tell the story nicely Stevie he went through some dark in a certain amount of dark he hit a floor or a pool or something and there from that level Something gold in what go ahead now yeah so some something that started to show um which uh was I, really couldn't latch on with a very succinct word like I could with the other two qualities but it was something very promising something Victorious like I would see uh an image of a trophy that seemed to indicate victory and, so you know I wasn't bothered I knew eventually something's going to explain itself but what it what it took me back to was from Early Childhood I really Rec re, remember this very well I was a firstborn child in my family I was a firstborn, grandson and in a sense had aspects of a golden boy you know I, had, a lot of things I felt like they were going for me but I recall being real resistant not wanting to be the center of attention not wanting to be shown off by, my mom as, somebody special and, that whole notion of hiding my light behind a bushel um and so that came up and it really touched me that uh this was, was going back to that time and it was obvious that I had pushed whatever that glowing Victory uh was I pushed it down can we call it equality now yeah I just don't have the that was a quality the beginning image was a whatever cup whatever golden cup you sit settle let it a little bit more it explains itself and you get to experience it more it's a quality so that quality he then remembered from childhood was also held back yeah okay yeah, yeah so as I'm tapping this morning there's an excitement about this because you know I used to it, would cross my mind that I knew I did this early on but I didn't think much of it, was just a thought that would come from time to time but now it's like saying hey you know pay attention to this, is this is very important and, uh so as I'm opening to this it's, very exciting yeah okay and here now U could I say lesser not being a negative word here but a lesser form than, Bob's okay Bob got into reincarnation times but you got into childhood and I'd say the same thing here what I'm trying to present is, there some relationship between getting three qualities I call that the Triangular person three qualities where self shows better there in Noah's case it showed that it was there by going through these images whatever of past lives the experience of past lives in Steve's case it showed his childhood when he squashed this one down wouldn't allow this one but is that self trying to guide to guide again to improve the character you need this third quality now unfortunately it was misunderstood in a past life and you squashed it down and stayed away from it and here in childhood you squashed it down it'll be interesting as he continues with this process better self and it'll probably show a past life, where he squashed that one down and why he squashed it down what the misunderstanding was okay anyway hope you're following my dialogue I think Steve you finished there is that good, enough yeah, yes uh that this third quality I call it the enhancer uh um that we have two qualities basic okay and to go deeper and get this third one and then the mix is much bigger okay when I used to do a four square pattern uh for different things of no you were around then I believe uh we did it on movie scripts and stuff and I did on business guys and guys that had uh, two, qualities uh were good businessmen basic, businessmen okay but guys who had three qualities they were starting to be a bit special a like of words they were on The Cutting Edge you knew they were special you keep your eye on that guy in fact if he was going to start a company you might say I think I'd like to be an early investor and throw a few bucks his way because there's something special there okay and then the big, time CEOs the big names uh seem to be have four things going on for them the that Mak sense in this context yeah so uh we'll come around another time maybe, next time and, play with entering the underworld and playing easy with the quality uh we'll keep it simple I think we sounds like it's time to go over that again take advantage of that but again I think what I'm saying is Gee and this is more of a question I'm throwing out at you uh when you start to play with the thre's pattern uh that the self seems like it's their clearer okay does that mean that a basic two person is going to have trouble picking up self I'm not saying that maybe it's a little harder I, don't know but the treezy suddenly it seems to be there so Noah says I get down a bit I get the third quality and being I meant to past lives and I know that's self's territory okay and Steve's case a little bit lesser but oh childhood memory, okay uh so just uh just something to F away I don't know you play you play that's your job okay where the hell are we, ah where are we where are we somebody any comments up to this point help me before I go mad over here let's say it's Amy from Oakland I have a question for you Amy Oakland yes maam I, missed last week so I didn't quite and I didn't catch up unfortunately but um I had a question about you're talking about threes are we saying that it's threes or is there a fourth realm because I feel like well, I feel like I hit a monster and I well of course you did if you're GNA play there's going to be a monster for most people yes but is that like in the third level or is that like a fourth quality uh does it matter h no it's not a fourth quality yet okay well take it slow you first start to go under you're G to bump into the next one which we'll call the third one okay is there a fourth one let's hold that off for a bit let's get let's get a great one two3 going here that's a uh an enhanced character it could be kind of really special, as I mentioned I was exploring it all last week it was pretty what monster did you bump into by well um I actually it was interesting because we talked last time about it possibly becoming through a dream someone mentioned Dreams yeah and I had this really intense dream and then kind of processed through the dream like thinking back about the dream and it was a there it was like there was a lot of stuff kind of like a broken house holding me back so there was a lot of this holding back no I don't know if I could actually name what the Monster well I could name what the monster is but I don't know if I can name the quality the holdback monster okay we'll keep it yeah the whole back month and I was talking to my mom and she's I asked her I'm like was there something in my childhood that happened because why am I like this and it always comes up it's like that repeated quality that always, keeps coming back and uh she said and she said that when I was a kid I was bossy and I thought what's, bossy what and I was recollecting about your story that you used to tell about the kid who was trying to dive and the father uh called it fear because you're shaking a little bit up there yeah, and so it's like oh that's kind of a negative so, I was wondering like what's the opposite of bossy and it was more like it was coming up like oh there's assertiveness there's like bringing forth my I've seen that in youro by the way dear oh really how many times have I seen that it looks good in the Aikido form by the way oh yeah when it's on yeah, but it was more question your Technique when it's not there yeah, so that was the other thing I was doing body work like trying to do some kettle bell things and I couldn't do it I couldn't it was like I was caught in the wrist and focused on not being able to do it so once I realized this monster and kind of expanded and got a different perspective I was able to perform a lot better because I allowed it to a truer nature of myself to be there so if we allow this third quality yeah and we actually make sure it's being mixed not just oh yeah I understand it's that's not good enough it's got to be got to pump the pump for a bit you know yeah gotta exercise that yeah and then we'll go exercise with the weights but we got to exercise that yeah that's part A lot of people Miss they're so smart I understand but they don't exercise it's like right I don't want to lose this one because this one's powerful but when you get that treey starting to be there Fuller and Fuller then you become more capable what you going to lift weights or what the hell your job is, yeah, yeah uh which we should go over again uh when Autumn comes on because that's a yeah piece here okay is that it thank you thank you ah, ah are people are you following us this discussion are we okay where the hell are we self, self okay easy the eye okay what we're playing with there's our basic Bobby easy settle open Basics get to next dimension chin the Energy Mix there mixes up Robert okay I'm working a two count there right Robert ah better Easy move into n level more space finder Dimension the energies are finder mix up a better n okay now someplace here or soon we're, on track uh a self especially if you it's kind of I'm uh I don't know prodding it don't know the phrase here uh okay easy I feel pretty good here's N Easy settle and self I heard ta I have a self or there's a self here self could you show yourself make yourself known here something to sort of spark what the communication of character to the self that's there uh so I, don't think Bobby can do it because this okay let me go earlier sorry uh we're in the vortex our creation we're in Vortex system tighter heavier back finer, finer, okay a okay a vortex in this Vortex that we got caught into the self also got vortexed so at a Bobby level the self is sort of wrapped around Bobby's my Imaging of, it so it's not a clear enough self easy Robert the self is still there wrapped around Robert but there's a little more what room, okay but I okay but I still if I say to, Robert uh do you know what self is and I'd say well Robert sh myself Robert okay just still wrapped in there a bit eventually with the third move or the fourth move eventually as we easy the eye the wrappings easy the self is clear from that entanglement of into Bobby Robert hopefully not Sensei has a sense of itself it's itself self okay so that easy the eye is my trick that I'm trying to present to get to the self that's there that's always been there that's always been there that's a very cool piece of the universal puzzle that we're in okay because it's a guide on to the character if NAD says self I would like to become a better character self can guide me can say well this quality that quality do settle down a bit more open a bit more what whatever it we can establish a real good communication with self and self is a guide on self is a mentor just some other words but they're basically that okay where to hell okay so characters in developing Go the Distance okay be careful when I do something like introduce self you say oh screw the character self, self yes it's important as hell but characters also are how to say this it's a, k continuation of certain pieces space is a continuation finer space finer space easy inner sense of finer space or Dimensions okay is ongoing It Go the Distance let's say character Bobby Rober nado then say soon you bump into art type characters okay that's a continuation it goes the distance or characters Go the Distance okay oh sense a very, very fine level of ensei had a character there all there all right I don't know if he made this known to the public Lauren you aware of anything about o sense's uh, character at this fantastic level he was at doesn't ring any bells for you yes no I heard people talk about how fantastic he was or no him his calling of his own character just the Classic uh you know you know IA he would say that you know s yeah he would talk about himself as the golden mitraa body saw right, but when he okay that's an archetype along the way in his telling I would say but he had a final one that he, he liked really didn't that's okay it's okay pass, it's all right ah anyway characters Go the Distance space goes the distance self goes, the distance the qualities that mix up the energies that are there goes the distance finer and finer and finer so certain things go the distance the important things space, qualities character self Go the Distance okay does that come across all right kind of important part of the map here and again careful oh I understand the map but you got to exercise in there you got to pump the pump you got to experience the experience just knowing about it nice important start step one now you got to play more experience you got to be that that's being experienced okay since it when you say you know Go the Distance I, I want to just make sure I understand what correctly it's, the sense that there's great depth there's always more that there's an orig point and you can take another step further it's a way it's a path it's not a certain thing that you, reach a level and you're done it just well people, people repeating that's what but see unfortunately along the way people get to a nice level and they stop because they're Superior I've arrived right they don't know the pieces they see a, nice quality it's really nice quality and they say oh I'm experiencing this quality I've arrived it's like Jesus it's, only one quality and we have to bring it back to the origin the, the path is Vortex thing the journey we're on it's getting finer and finer and finer with all of these pieces being experienced to the source the source the beginning uh I don't know I got to be careful the words here uh you're yeah you're oh you're oh God I want to say you as a God I got to be careful here but back to the origin of you okay uh, the Christ Place the where ensei is about now Place uh this very, original ex and the experience that's there what, should we call that the source back to the source we could call some people call it the Original Soul well the original soul is the self that's come back to yes it's a more original Oh Sensei Lov that word original the original space the original, the original space the original character the original Self yes original infers what back to the beginning, yeah fantastic beauty of things yeah we get a little bit of a hint when we go from a one by one to a 3X3 whoa pretty good to a 4x4 who I'm special people look up at me in the world you know I make more money than anyone else oh uh where am I going with that oh that the beginning is some Ultra Perfection something you have to get there and experience it but it'll be a nice Journey once you catch on a few tricks know how to do it fully along the way uh could be yeah but that's the journey see, we, sort of got screwed up a certain way and getting bortex so tight I ended up being a, human okay and, the stupidity and the stuff we do at a certain level got to unwind from that move into finer dimensions and finer and heading towards again since he loves the word more original he says after a while stop it with the finer because you have the ability of going more original and I won't explain that anymore you do with it what you will yes finer Dimensions finer, finer certain point enough now more original more original what the hell does that mean to you and I've got nothing more to say there ah where are we sense is that where the um the tradein comes in oh wait is that where the kind of like tradein or the um like ezdi okay um methodologies come in when you've got a really, solid character I mean as, like you've evolved a little bit into other Realms to, dimensions and you're in like okay I'm in a Ado or an ad do Sensei even or what bad day fair day good day right keep it simple then is there as that's developing the self is also developing and the self has those healing qualities that can also improve the character even just a percentage or two more right okay careful how you speak your voice blurs on me a little bit over, here, so speak some something just I can so it doesn't blur on me otherwise I have to check with Brad and say what' she say okay so, so you got a good a, fair day yes okay and there's the trade in okay now we trading in for the next Dimension where it's good day country yes in that country the these qualities there will mix up a good day person I'm having a good day it is a good day and I'm enjoying the hell about a good day and at the same time the self is evolving with you okay yeah, I think we said it fairly clearly a little while ago here tonight that there's a seems to be or there is a relationship at a certain level when we when, you all catch and get more experience with self, that uh self has a lot of knowledge or something that it feeds to you okay and I think uh it's also going on in, in good dreams that that's happening but different discussion right now but self is there okay what self because it's, you right uh would like you the character to develop because you're part of the develop do don't know the word develops along with it they're in uh what's the word they're in uh Mutual tandem thank you they're, in tandem after a bit Yeah is, that okay people is that yeah and then, kind of is there because they're running parallel right maybe not parallel but kind of what you're talking about, Rel in, relation could we say yeah yes so there's a relationship happening and maybe, it's is that where the triangle comes in oh okay triangle, comes in oh okay triangle, sorry just triangle the way I'm using it here is the character being able to be an enhanced or better or better character now the basic character let's say Works off of two qualities basic you okay but we need you at a better level than a basic you okay you know that we need you to be special right you know that I'm talking to her now but also talking to everybody you all know you ought to be special you all sort of think your special anyway here's how to be, special so this third quality enhances mixes up a much, better character okay and then as this kind of self the more original Self is evolving and you're able to tap I don't know if it's tap into it into it or allow it to come through because the character, is I want you say tap into are we talking about self I got lost yes, so you're let's say it's there okay yeah there my, first sense of self I liked was uh it's its own thing okay once it once we get this clear separation from the eye from self that's wrapped up in an eye Bobby and, realize holy it's its own thing okay it has its own flavor its own texture let's say I, like uh a piece of glass i al sort of wish I had a piece of glass just uh put that here here's a character now I put the piece and there's the self right, there okay it's in pandem with I don't like for you to be thinking of you meaning anybody uh you the world to be thinking of a self as some kind of hovering spiritual being I'd like to put it better here now so that also the communications from the self to the character include I don't know what to say h the all the directions no that's not right uh but if it's just an idea you, may kind of get not catch that it's, an energy mix character is that coming out right can you say it again in a different way that feels really important yeah one more time well maybe we could look at self as a frame character as the picture in the frame as the character improves the frame has to say hold holy I got to get a bit bigger hair to assist the picture to be better because I want the picture to get better because it's part of the trip back to our origin, character self the more space that's there the qualities that mix up energies that mix up all are important pieces on our journey back to who the hell we really okay before I forget I talking to you personally what I think you can work the mix of the character a bit better I think you haven't been exercising quite enough with character development okay uh I think and maybe this, uh this third, quality, uh if you're not aware of it or something uh but anyway do catch it quickly which you can do uh to what word am I using uh, enhance the enhancing uh get this third quality to enhance the character even more, she should be from inner stronger okay, as if as if you haven't been exercising enough so you're a little, soft or weak I'll exaggerate soft and weak okay we need a little better character that's the mix okay, thank you sensy yeah so we'll get a better character just improving your whether using In-N-Out beats or up and down beat we'll get a better character now we're getting more advanced and I'm saying in the Underworld a lot of people don't tap no big deal learn a few tricks it's great territory we'll tap this third quality that sources from there comes from there well and we'll get a better mix get this triangular guy mix whatever you want to call it the enhanced one mix and exercise with pump the pump not an idea concept we start with that I lay it out on a map but you're not finished cuz I lay it out on the map you if you're interest have to get in there and settle and open and pump the pump experience that not just know about that experience it careful this son of a gun up here is sharp he's thinking about it and he'll think he's having an experience which is not the experience I don't know what to say it any better but you got to double check that this is historical misunderstanding okay of the upper Heaven God's up there oh and they missed a whole under half of things and you can't go the distance doing that you can't go to the end result doing that system won't let you so let's catch on now to the full of things, Fuller the Fuller the Fuller, okay one of those sense his job was to try to introduce the under but it was bad times to introduce the under and again of World War II death and destruction all over the place and the Japanese inherently you think we're bad they have an extra about the underworld monster land don't deal with that don't, open up anything there Monster Land evil spirits uh we're bad I think they're even a little bit worse so he said he had a lot of trouble there because it was a bad time to be presenting this so he did little things to try to show them he said uh, what do you why, do you think I taught him SW Wasa try to get him to be at the floor and to open up to a little deeper hoping that in opening up to a little deeper they'd catch the enhancement factor a bit of a quality there okay and probably they didn't get very far uh they went a little bit to where they could walk around on their knees fast typical people, typical here's the beginning of all fantastic pot wow journey beingness and it's like oh look at me I can hop a little bit better than anybody on my block I've, arrived excuse me certain things piss me off as you may have noted uh anyway uh Autumn are we okay up, to this point yeah uh so um and remember you've got a very good self so uh so uh your sense of self and its presence shouldn't be hard for you because it's you started off good with this uh I, think what I'm learning or relearning learning or relearning maybe is that the um the character is allowing me to do a lot more grounding and creating a space for the self to show up yeah, uh yeah uh let's see I thought reward that but yes, yes uh better the character yeah as you get more grounded and whatever, okay better character yeah and let's say right there we say okay I'm better grounded I'm feeling stronger whatever, whatever okay and then you say to the okay could you guide me on to my next development it's the guide on and then we'll learn to now you're going to have different forms of how you, hear how you're being instructed by yourself, uh for examp some basics for me are uh I often get pictures okay uh Bob in your past life thing were you getting pictures of The Squire yes yeah so you might see little movies so to speak okay you might sort of hear words not you hear them in your ears but you, can hear them, okay uh there's a sensing let see what one, one of my historical stories I was just doing basic meditation stuff and, at the end of The Meditation I said reincarnation exists and with a strong feeling yes and then I said wait a minute how do I know this nothing happened in the meditation to point this out to me I just suddenly knew and how do I know help was talking to me and I just had this sense this knowing sense out of seemingly nowhere did that, come across all right many, many years ago my history anyway okay so different ways self communicates or you hear self communicating uh imagery you hear things a sense experience in my, added words there that you sort of can't prove but you just know it's like no matter what happens you know it and you'll always know it okay it's like in within your system it can't be [Music] disproved so what do what do you want to call that sense knowing sense communication I don't know what to call it remember keep your basics in mind idea no thinking feeling finer feeling sensing sense experiencing that's still valid here okay so if you just think about what self is saying big screw up you try to feel what self is saying it's a little heavy still finer feeling and say still too heavy easy beginning to sense ooh right around in there a sense but maybe not clear yet easy finer easy finer sensing and there should be much clearer much clearer much clearer but I lay that out all right okay let's put it this way also if I just if I end up as Bobby tomorrow morning stupid Bobby and I say okay self what do you have to say I, don't think Bobby if he hangs on to being Bobby can really get anything and'll be a little so I remember I'm getting pretty fast because I practice a, lot but it can be that fast but don't say okay I'm going to be fast self what he saying and then you make up stories you're mentally fast but you haven't haa to that level okay so self is there self is the guide on the mentor uh I think a lot of people when they say God told me they're referring to the self okay that's a little bit big God told me to for me a little bit big okay s uh, you guys who like to say the commi told me yeah but I don't know bunch of butterflies running around talking to me I don't know self, you don't know what a self is go through your level of Bobby Robert noo easy let him go and see what's there after sure a bit it's there that's why I, think I used to practice dying cut my wrist sit practice bleeding to death think oh I got laundry to pick up come on N you're dying there is no laundry you know so I would try to really clear from a character okay and not move into another character just clear from that character, just clear from that character so totally only thing there was self okay I always like the idea of pouring a bucket of acid so the body just totally disappeared okay and not to move on to quote an astop plane but just now what here referring to self okay so kind of dumb but you see what I was trying to do and where I was going with that so self is there it's constant, uh again I like the positioning of self okay uh keep it in the in the here, and now uh remember we're in the vortex let me see let me see if, this does it uh this um heavier D heavier Dimension finer, NE finer next we're in this Vortex so comes in tighter heavier okay we, easy, we're moving it to the next set, okay easy so following that Vortex and that dimensionality practice and a couple of tricks of how to move from to from a from a to how to move from a bad day to a fair Day to a good day how to move from Bobby to Robert NAD okay how to move from a one bu to a two by to a three by all the same story, just different angles on it some people might like the Bobby Robert NAD style others might like the 1X 2x3x style others might like to Bad Day Fair Day great good day great day style whatever, whatever I've laid out the basic scheme what form do you want to do that scheme, okay all right don't be dumb uh I for example a lot of those Sensei wordings and stuff are bizarre I mean bizarre they're bizarre in Japanese you know uh once I catch it was something important but how he would describe it was like okay I really can't catch that description okay but I, know at this point something important is happening so I'd be prepared for that something important at that point I wouldn't try to mimic everything because that was his wording his style oh I don't know if I said that well anyway so see where am I Vortex being, oh that might be hard for this first unit to catch your self oh because the self is wrapped up in there but eventually let's say here let's say here okay just do some Basics let's say here easy the eye has been good enough to where you catch wait a minute there's something else here okay so here's the, the frame use the picture in the frame here's the frame the self okay uh I like glass for quite a while piece of glass here's the glass self okay uh we should be prepared to have a sense of self as a circular field because it's, all it's all circular this is a circular uh so it should be a, field that the right word yeah but whatever form helps you at first with self ah that what I'm looking forward to and I, need to spend more time also uh remember I'm hitting you with some fairly, new stuff even for me I can remember oh I touch on that 20 years ago or 50 years ago didn't realize what it was or didn't invest enough in it I didn't know how, uh but when we get to the stage where the communication of self to character and the and the benefit self help me out here I'd like to progress boom what do you suggest and then you can pick up that much more clearly and then you exercise with it mix it so to speak and be that character and then if you want to continue fine I really feel good as whatever next could you help me continue and it will because as it grows you have to grow it's all part of one, package space self character in before I go too crazy something I wanted to add was it what was it oh it oh characters so I use the Bobby Robert nadoo pattern Sensei but soon we, bump into sort of a biggie as far as characters are concerned you bump into an art type AR type characters okay and archetype characters just a continuation but they seems like they major, inequality so one of my archetype characters is a Buddha, wisdom thing uh he's fairly constant I figure he's a regular uh and his main lines are mainly on wisdom calm, wisdom kind of thing uh a different Arch type will kick in eventually here and show a different major, quality, okay where am I going okay so archetypes along the way are important and important to experience them not just to think about you Bobby thinking about J I read inight 1A today about, Arch types ah what's my Arch type I, don't think you're going to get it's you might get a little dribble of truths of truths but you open up to that level past character to character to character to character to character to character and in that more space next it's a big jumping a something it's an arch type very good tells you're really on, the road in experiencing them okay you'll each have your, own arch types um fig you can get at least two fairly easy eventually three and four should kick in we'll see we'll see but the first couple ought to be kind of fun and fairly easy you play uh but that's a continuation of the character line okay and there's something, even p even p four major art types eventually uh that's uh I don't know what to call him but it's getting towards the end of the road here where there'll be one, one main character anyway just pointing things out you won't be able to do anything with that if you're steing your Bobby Robert NAD I'm smart level again it has to be experienced it has to be experienced but hopefully this stuff helps you move through faster and smoother see for example Noah in bumping into icky oil ah I don't want to let that into my system but he's learned a trick easy it's not what it appears like let me settle and open some more and I'm inferring this is a fin I settle and open, and very soon it changed from iy to something that was hey it's a more fluidity in my system it's, feeding me then you begin to realize wait it's a quality what's the quality that mixes, the enhanced character you see you learned a couple tricks of the trade you can move through this stuff kind of fast much easier, okay see by hearing my stories of sitting on a snake pit for example and saying well look at I did these simple settling opening tricks and, and they begin to show their true colors and there were beautiful spiraling energies coming from a beautiful Source okay uh but what if you didn't know any of this and you're a little heavier say dumber and you're oh I, was sitting there and I settled a bit and there a there's a bunch of snakes biting me and, and I'm supposed to sit here forever and, and sit on the snakes biting, me what a shame what a shame couple little tricks little knowledge experienced we can move through a lot of this stuff much faster much smoother okay we're running out somebody let's finish this ah did I lose you too badly here tonight uh sense Bob here yeah taking the uh storyline we're working on to the not to the present but to, this lifetime uh I grew up in a Catholic family and all the priests in that we encountered many of them said yeah you should be a priest you, would be a great priest when I went said that to you right then I went through RC program in the Air Force and they said no you should be a fighter pilot you would be a great fighter pilot and in both of those cases I knew that, was self I wouldn't have used that term at the time but so know you've already done those things you have to move along yeah you could do those things but you've already done them maybe done them many times time to move along yeah so I paid attention to that yeah uh yeah we've probably been proded like, that through our lives um CU self is there and even though it might be entwined a bit there's enough times where it can send you a clear shot like no not that let's go here you know my feeling about when I decided to go to Japan I knew I could stay in the States California continue train training the barbell gymm training the Judo I was going to visit other Judo schools around the state let them hit me with their best shots just to learn their stuff uh t d but as I sat I was sitting a fair amount at that time as I sat it was like yeah I could but I'd still be involved with the boys in blue being a cop it still be hanging out with the cops uh they're, a Brotherhood so you'd still be hanging out with them even though I would have quit the police force to major in training uh, anyway just very clear yeah you could but let's do this instead let's go to Japan, okay and then a lot of little things happening to point away so a self even years ago has been throwing stuff at you and Bob is saying that you know throw his life there's been times where you something, told him something prodded him yeah I'm just saying if we do this process right we can get this really clear conversation benefit from it we can really move along yeah that's my hopes before we finish anything we ran out of time here that's it thank you Cy thank you take care see you in I forget the date the thir the next date will be the 16th of February okay febrary and I think maybe we should maybe play with that an easy approach to equality and let's just get used we touched on it before but let's, touch and try to have fun with it yeah thank you so much Sensei thank you sense thank you s thank you thank you thank you thank you Bob thanks Bob thanks

## Two Beats of Creation Robert Nadeau, Aikido 8th Dan

**Date:** Unknown date  
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjWDgkU3S0

good sense for me, and what else in there not what else and I go looking around within that field of beauty what else is here and beauty and what and after a little bit the, here to for not so obvious inherent power I think we call in inherent partner begins to I don't know talk show itself you begin to get a sense of something easy don't jump the gun easy till it's also there full board you got Beauty and I don't know stability, and Beauty whatever, is that did I say that O Okay so for me that's how I kind of do it I it's inherent in the First Quality it's own [Music], partner so inherent in that first one is its partner so I use and, then I'm open nice quality I'm experiencing and inferring what's the not so obvious partner to this so that's my and my that's a keyword that I use there and, I'm open for it to begin to show okay yeah did I say that all right before we move on anybody anything else on qualities that you want to check nothing zilch okay let's move on to tonight and what was what, was the write up Lauren two beats of creation two beats of, creation, okay very important okay let, me read I think it's better for me to read it TR remember uh here's what I wrote a little bit ago in the beginning the great everything whatever that means to the Great, everything uh whatever the word decides, whatever that means to create, okay so in this great everything deciding to create there's some kind of beat there let's we, could go at it as a beat into the center and then it re beats back out or vice versa boom to boom bang boom bang so whichever way you sense it but this first establishment of the beginnings of creation whether you do Circle to Center, to Circle whatever okay so there's a, a beat rebeat pattern that starts in the beginning, okay ah hang on okay, then from the beginning there it starts a Vortex so from the finer more original I don't know call it size for right now the finer original Purity Perfection whatever of it, starts the vortex now we use kind of two words there one there's a sense of smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller to the human level or something uh that's okay and at the same time we're saying No this Vortex is just moving into the next heavier Dimension continues to beat into the next heavier Dimension so you have a Vortex, okay that's dimensionality finer Dimension to heavier Dimension okay and in know in that process the two beats are still going on okay so now even down to the human level let's say it's so heavier than the original finer but the two beats are still there that's a I don't know a forever pattern two beats are they from its Inception when it started as a TW beat it continues all, the way down into heavier Dimensions still too beating are you following me am I saying this okay so far yeah Steve your mouth is a gape are you okay no, I'm fine I'm taking notes okay, so far me continue with reading okay so two beats all along the way now here we are in the human condition, level and all the major pieces that make up that creation uh the character to the arch type the qualities the self space everything, here are in that uh what should we call it are in that working or that law don't know if those are good words but they're, they're involved are they um once we get some sense experience that we have a uh then we have a fairly simple vehicle for dimensional travel if this two beat at the heavier we catch this 2 beat easy the 2 beat will move us into the next Dimension so if Bobby okay or my one by one level and remember to check in on its two beat his TW beat will move into an opening into the next level so it's Bobby to robber or a one by one to a 2 by two set or a bad day set to a fair day set and that pattern can take you back from this heavier that we're in take you back as a travel vehicle to the more original Perfection of you Perfection of everything that, it's the return Journey back using the two beat as a reference to do the traveling with did that come out right yes it did okay, then let's shift to uh let's use birth as an example here we are in a human condition uh now the two beats in terms of a birth uh have started much earlier they started at conception let's say or even earlier what whatever they had he and she had an idea to breed okay what whatever, but now we get the actual baby being born okay Human Condition baby being born now what's the seems to me what's the first thing that they do they have to make sure that, brand new baby still dripping wet and whatever is breathing right they got to get it breathing there's the let's in a certain way the first human replay of the two beat inhale exhale you got to get that, brand new baby make sure that two beat is there, how do they recognize it he starts to breathe if he was looking a little bluish before he's starting to look pink he's starting to come more alive he makes a sound whoa whatever okay so the two beat is starting right there okay so could we say that's the first in a certain way that's the first, in a certain way that's the first two beat of a human being okay the breathing or the breath beat, okay uh and again we know the breathing is a popular form of two beating uh it's an ancient form of you know meditation or whatever uh it's, it's a good one it's an important one it's a basic one it's not the only one though okay right are we okay so far you okay with the baby being born okay ah let's continue with the with the baby for, a bit so okay now he's breathing and More and More Alive and then kind, of look at some of the things we, do uh we, rock we rock the baby are we not introducing it to a little bit more level of two beats look at the old, fashioned cradles they, were all basically a cradle were we again inferring a two beat and within the two beat it's okay to be there sleeping and you you'll grow even as you're sleeping because of this Tube beat that's there okay a little bit older when you take the baby and sort of not necessarily throw it up in the air but hey and it comes down and you're laughing all right you're saying this is great you're introducing another two beat an up and down beat or, down and up beat whatever okay and you're introducing that as being a lot of fun you see when you catch this two beat little baby how happy we all are I laugh and then you begin to laugh and you, love this love this heho hey ho G game we're playing and it continues after a while the little kid is older now he goes to the park and he's got his little kid swing back and forth and back and forth and in that two beat there was some kind of development oh we could be Heavy and stupid say yes he's developing his leg muscles he's reaching with his legs on the swing yes, yeah that's all true that's all true but let's get to the nitty gritty of things here he's developing because of the two be of things the character the child is developing as a six-year-old or whatever he is okay and then it goes on they have the, the older kids swings that really went boom and boom I remember those I love those could swing so big you suddenly got scared you twirl all around and, anyway and on and on and on okay are we okay with the baby's upbringing with the beat I mentioned this to Susan and she said oh also there's and Susan's hot lately on communication she's sort of majoring in that as a quality development anyway uh and she said yeah you the baby kind of can't quite yet talk but it murmured something, whatever and you hear it and then you say back if you're the father you say Daddy and the baby CS or whatever and you go get Daddy so you're listening and talking back and listening, and talking back and listening and talking back hoping that the child gets to this level where it can repeat Oh Daddy or momy whatever so that's another TW beat talking and listening, talk Sensei we've lost you you've frozen okay sorry I lost the picture there for a moment we were in conversation with the, infant talk listening and talking back is everybody else still live yeah I think n's picture is frozen there right okay stand by hold on hold on sorry what's not uh so, they're going to work with it on their side for a moment or two Lauren right yeah okay no okay, I should have a slide that says due to circumstances beyond our contral please stand by due to technical difficulties the audio version of that is pretty good actually that you just gave yes when I when I grew up television would have that and they would throw a test signal or a card on screen you know stand by Lauren you're not that old that you can remember that I believe we're almost the same age teacher late, 20s you mean oh yeah, all right yes this is where we tap dance well I would I would comment for just a minute why we're there getting that together until Sensei comes back please um as we're as we're kind of looking at that um of course for me as a musician I'm thinking Rhythm, is a part of everything the breath, is a rhythm and rhythms are patterns in nature so it's pretty it's pretty cool so NAD is uh, was recognizing the breath as, one of the first and major things talking are we on mute or something yeah um I'm talking uh Sensei I just uh was giving my, impression of your teaching just now and uh Brad your camera is still off we hear you but your camera's off that's I think he disappeared okay well, keep going keep going TJ well it's essentially it's essentially that, in the in the what NAD calls the two beats of creation such a beautiful way of describing the elementary patterns that arise out of the one comes the two and I mean that's the way the Dallas see it that's the way Buddhists see it the grand pictures that's the pattern that arises out of the one so it's interesting in that way isn't it uh that we have a pattern that for, Sensei he works with it in such a way that, if you want to have this as a what he calls a travel vehicle if you want to have it as a travel vehicle you experience the fullness of, those beats at any particular level what he would say and this is oh that, his Bobby must experience a relative fullness of those two beats of the qualities that are present for him as a as a Bobby in order to come to the uh to the Robert so and it's the same it's the same for us too obviously the, connection of two beats the um allows for an experience of the fullness or a relative what I would call a relative, what I would call a relative fullness of connecting with some aspect of our being okay so that's what you there Sensei not quite was that uh was that Jason I'm, I'm back on can you Central yes we're back yeah we can see you and hear you okay you okay fantastic thank you what was Tia saying so I can catch up I was talking about uh the two beats and um and H and how you use them as a travel vehicle at any particular level so was using your example of saying a relative, fullness of your Bobby is essential before you move to a Robert so you the two beats act as a way of filling allowing a, greater wholeness a greater fullness of the experience of what you yeah have without at any particular level be before you try to go on to another one yeah I think that's where, you were draw where you uh were right as we were uh as we lost signal thank you okay yes sir, um yeah you see again that same old problem of being aware of and mentally sort of understanding uh but this lower part this body character part is very important so in a TW beat okay let's go over this you get a TW beat and the, balance point can we just call it temporarily the harmony of your two beat okay and there's a in some form a nice feeling there could be peaceful uh, it could be nice what whatever okay so there's that Harmony of the two beat okay but now it's critical okay to go a little bit deeper in there and I use the question okay at this, level who am I and I let it for lack of words mix up the character who I am, okay yeah so if let's say h nicer was the uh balanced Harmony of the two beats but yes but who am I and of course I'm a nice guy yes of course of course let's, go deeper than that who am I of course you're a nice guy and who are you feel you feel yourself who are you you're a character feel yourself feel yourself and it's changing out from nice guy to a little more accepting of the world a little more open to the world, a little more open to the world okay so here's a character that's more open to the world if we were in communication I could hear what's being said to me better and maybe hopefully retort better, and maybe hopefully retort better so I'm a character now okay all right, so the two beats harmony let's say and whatever you feel there's cool but don't stop who are you or who am I not as a night let me think about, it let's see I don't mean that I mean this as T was saying this fullness of, the character and the character will have a sense of things without just having that mental up there sense of things we need the body we need the character, is an ongoing through this whole trip okay we character and finer Bobby Robert noo is what I my historical layout for a better level character, okay uh and then we move into finer after a while we bring up the term Arch type it's still your characters Arch type characters but they're finer qualities are more obviously present da, da, da, oh am I getting lost am I losing you where the hell are we here the criticalness of being the character in there okay there okay another critical point there is through that Harmony Center again I call it a doorway there's an opening or a doorway so the character and then into the next finer and you move into the next Dimension and you start the game over again the beats that are there okay and then the whatever, the balance point there the harmony point there and who are you as a character there you're not robbert anymore you're not do kind of thing okay all, right so it's an ongoing pattern but very important to get that uh not to be satisfied with just the for like of words the harmony of things that's nice and I could see just hanging out with that because it's really nice but the game goes game goes on okay so I'm not saying you can hang out there for a while and enjoy it uh but if you want to really travel with the trip if you really want to move along uh you got to get to that who am I and the doorway sends to a finer Dimension did I say that okay you people okay with this very clear tonight yeah good, good, because it's really more than important it's kind of yeah this feeling of being a character gives everything Tang help me here uh, T because you're so pushing on this uh the tangibility of being a character let me know it's, an experience unfortunately the mental awareness types will think also they're experiencing it and they probably are at a certain mental level but it's not the experience that we're talking about the actual the actual guy who can walk his talk so to speak he doesn't just talk the walk he walks to talk okay a little bit, different H yeah there is and there is the Rhythm uh the, Rhythm is a beat it's something that's happening it's not just conceptual yes, yeah the, Rhythm and the P of the pattern is a beat yeah and that I think if anything that's one of the, ways in which working with the two beat becomes experiential and not just a, concept about yeah that yeah that that's what I'm trying to say very good can you say it again the difference between the concept of the beat and the beginnings of experiencing in finer dimens finer sense of experience the more actual of experience can we CL for troops anyway here uh well I'll give it a try but it's, kind of like the, pattern of Tu beat itself is mimicking the universe in its pulse in its rhythm that's why I use the word Rhythm because rhythm is actually a pattern it's a pattern in nature it's a pattern of nature just like that first breath that we that we take and the last breath that we exhale yes so it's, a major presence so everything and you'll see examples of it in, nature yes everywhere, because the, whole because it's there in whole, because it's there in whole creation it's a pattern it's a p rhyth Rhythm is a thing rhythm is rhythm is a manifestation the cycles of the seasons have rhythms our breath is a rhythm our heartbeat is a rhythm these are all rhythms they're all patterns not to be you know think about them yes fine but it's you know as you not to misunderstand that yeah as I mean that's fine think about it for a bit mull on it sure read a book about it but that's not good enough now it has to be experienced it has to be experienced because what you're talking about is a, transformational travel vehicle you're talking about trans transforming and, that's a that's a way of moving from the, the Bobby Robert Nido Sensei or 1 by two by3 by pattern that we are exploring as, something genuinely transformational that's why your book is about transformation it's not just about, transformation it's not just about iido you know so hang on a second his is yeah it's is that him us who is that no it's well it's coming it has to come to the computer speakers tonight for whatever reason so it's just no big deal just uh the lips and sound are in syn right now yeah the lips and sound are out of sync but that's okay once we, can hear everybody fine yeah there's no trouble with that okay I just can't read, their lips anymore okay, uh okay where are we okay the variety again you've heard most of these before but let's go from here the variety of two beats okay breathing we said was cool one ancient one uh probably everybody will touch on that one some time or other uh I remember my breathing, years uh count to eight exhale eight whatever, that kind of stuff um but there are others oh Sensei came up with quite a few uh he liked up and down or down and up, spirals he just sense a spiral of energy and a spiral of energy okay I like that one I loved for me it was up and down Spirals and I really developed quite well with that uh as the spirals got more the height and depth Factor got more, balanced or in harmony uh then the character would be a bit better character so you go from a let's say a blue belt character to a brown belt character to a black belt character and everything is there not just the idea of it up and down and up and down I should be a black belt we can't just do this mental half that's a piece but, this fullness experiential is also critical you just can't do this half mind thing and really do the, trip the developmental trip it needs all the parts so you can't just take half of a, part and expect to get there in your own mind you might be Godlike but you're also and ain't nothing happening except in your own mind yeah now there's got to be some experience some feeling well know since they stood there you knew somebody was standing there, was very little question unless you're really dumb and you couldn't see anything I'm sure a lot of people saw Christ walked down the road and say ah don't mind him he's The Carpenter's Kid ah now some people don't have the eyes don't worry about those people but really anybody with a finer sense of things ought to say whoa who is that because there's something there not an idea an actual presence that has its own idea about itself so that awareness mind stuff is fine but it's, not the full picture it's half the picture and this experiential half for like of words this body half this character half critical, and I keep pounding on that because so many people are just awareness half different styles so uh spirals up and down, and up oh since they had some esoteric ones the, fire water okay fire inferred one of the Beats its partner water so this was a fire water as it got more and more B it would be a sense of presence of steam okay right so steam would tell you at this level it's Balan they're, they're both in agreement with each other they're equal to each other, they're equal to each other otherwise you can't get steam you get too much fire it burns the water away if you get too much water it drowns the fire so it just infers a balance point could I say okay now again the piece that a lot of people will miss is, okay however to say this in the steam or through the steam who am I at this level who am I the character at this level okay and you hang out as that character and experience it again and remember that same point is a doorway to the next size more space more room the next Dimension and then we continue at that level fire water, fire steam, steam we continue so it's a potenti after a bit pretty fast and smooth Journey Through the dimensional to the finer more original ah okay where the hell are we up to this point did I say that okay s this is Lauren you you've just explained in a new away from me Shinu the traditional o sensei's traditional you know exercise often be at the beginning of class involving both the jewel shaking motion that you just showed as well as the uh you know the rowing, exercise and at the it culminates if you will in a stretch up down and then a compression kyi yeah which I now in your words it's that's the doorway right there and I didn't have the words for it before but I've always felt that or been taught that you know that sense as you step through that doorway that's where the iido starts that's, where the iido starts that's where you start your practice you know yeah and in there sounds like say since they showed uh if he was doing those close together four different patterns okay so here's one pattern patterns okay so here's one pattern steams uh here's another pattern it's the rowing back and forth pattern right but again you can get to a certain level of gee this feels good I feel stronger or something to let you know they're in harmony the force going out feels equal to the force coming back and the force going back feels equal to the force going out again there's that Harmony or balance there yes there now there don't be satisfied with just that oh I'm stronger yes of course of course of course of course but continue with this now who am now who am I okay and experience yourself character at that level and then be prepared to move into the next dimension of that and you continue with the rowing at the next Dimension yes same pattern okay yes and then this in and out I don't know that, yep that the same thing all, these energies from we're back to the how I laid out the origin of this everything from out comes in and boom goes back out or vice versa yes yeah yes yeah the uh boken swinging up and down see everyone gets caught up in hitting things harder hitting them faster and yeah that'll naturally happen but the inner work here once they feel like they're in harmony the up and the down the, the, down flavor of or may I use sort of an energy sense of how much energy is coming down if it's 20 lbs coming down I should like a sense of 20 lbs coming up 20 lbs coming down to get that balance again my words then again who am I and the obvious is why I'm a sword swinger or a boken swinger yes that's obvious but let's go a little deeper than that who am I here and you get a bigger a bigger sense of things other than just being a stick swinger and on and on and on okay what else we got here and iido techniques we have a, simple basic is receptive positive again a lot of people get caught up in doing the technique uh and it's like yeah but that's not really the purpose that's our, our reference but the purpose is to get a Harmony of receptive and positive till they, feel like the same size field or they had the same amount of weight to them 20 lb receptive guy 20 lbs positive guy okay then we should stop after a few minutes of training there and go who am I, here okay and get past the first thing uh oh I'm, the receptive positive guy he like yes of course you are but really who are you really let's go a little bit deeper, there and you experience the a next finer character you okay yeah uh so sometimes in using what is those since they call that a, form no uh I forget but in, presenting a form which a lot of which we probably all need to get going here on this you suddenly make the form out there the God and it's like no, it's a I don't know to say a reference but this inner experience is going to be Godlike this is the trip this is just something to help me register running out of words here ah let me see go over Basics [Music], Basics chanting okay so we did oh sense M okay uh we could always do short versions of whatever uh we could say uh a is from the center out and oh heard everything a had to say and it's returning back with its version of it, [Laughter], oh a heard that was touched by that a the he and the she are having a conversation here when they can come to an agreement right there now who am I okay it's well I'm the guy at chance yeah yes, yes but Jesus let's go deeper than that who are you really let's go okay remember that's a doorway to the next dimension of o and a and a and o so uh so it's using the two beats to move along dimensionally finer experientially present in the middle of all of this uh hang on a moment let's see anyway I wrote here big letters too often the character experience is missed or not emphasized people get very happy with the, harmony or the balance place there it's nice it's nice is um Ross on tonight no, okay have to talk about them anyway uh so sometime back we're playing with Beats and he reached a nice level and he said oh it's nice and I said who are you, and he said oh I'm the nice guy and it's like of course of course but I didn't mean that level of course if it's nice then you're yes but a little finer than that little deeper finer who are you okay it goes beyond nice guy who are you and it's also a doorway which brings you to the next level Next Level let's use a dumb example more room finder and energy qualities there and, you could be the very nice person okay so from nice to very nice to and the words would change there from nice to something else loving of all God's creation I don't know anyway where the hell are we here uh just the variety and all the physical things the, uh golfer dot to dot it's a Harmony check but don't most the golfer get caught up and I'm going to hit that ball further and they're all so busy out there they forget that this is really a game to help you get Inner and if you get better the inner, and if you get better the inner that's when the golf champions start to appear okay because they get the inner stuff going so of course they natural functioning outer is better yeah but not because they're going to hit it harder where where's the balance practice, there even though it's there with the back and the forth they don't catch it uh but again it doesn't have to be physical uh it could be uh your they offer you the next level up let's say where you have there's more responsibility in this job and the first are like whoa wow whatever because that is touching this and can this character rise to the occasion or intake the energies to be the character who is comfortable with that level job okay so it doesn't all have to be physical, it could be how are you with your family and boom from your family boom from you as the head of your family or the mommy of your family or whatever uh so we don't have to relegate this just to the physical moves, okay it's open for anything and everything I need a break here talk to me but I confuse you along the way anything, interesting observations insights questions problems hello out there in the world Sensei I just had something that I was that I was remembering when you said uh when you're talking about golfing you were talking, about golfing you were talking about the inner game oh yeah the inner game inner game of golf yeah and but I think one of your students wrote a book on the inner game of tennis back in the day I maybe in the in the 80s yeah if it was my student it was somebody who was around in the ESN days so they may have I don't recall exactly but there was the inner skiing that was one of my one of my students yeah inner skiing but just, to think that that's kind of revolutionary in itself you know to think well it's not just about getting the ball down the down the driveway or whatever it's I'm not a goist so yeah uh yeah it's not just about getting it down there when the way that you said which I really appreciated that's when the real champions start to appear they're working they're working on another whole level and I think that's what is available to us yeah in doing the, kind of working with the TU beats and working with these various travel Vehicles we have we can we can deepen our creativity we can deepen our, spiritual experience hold it right there that's cool, uh yeah so if you're not interested in finer spiritual beingness what we're laying out here is useful for just functioning in daily life right back to what TJ was saying you want to play better golf hey okay settle and open I'll teach you a couple of tricks you get to a little better level and lo and behold you're golfing will, be better I, played with Mike Michael M Murphy who wrote golf in the Kingdom which was uh kind of an inner spiritual experience book on golf or something uh and so we went out to the driving range and I did a certain pattern with him to stop him from hitting the ball and whatever and he'd been golfing for years and years he loved golf right that was his thing uh but I got him to a place where he caught onto what I was trying to, present and he hit a bucket of balls straight away everyone and pretty far at the end of it he looked at me and said he'd never in all of his years ever hit a full bucket of balls straight away little momentary magic there, there you go that's exactly ex exactly Ina um Ina um what that book inner game of tennis as Bob was talking I thought of the exact same book because I remembered the uh example the, tennis player used of his opponent and they were asking you know is this guy tough for you, know is he a real challenge he said no this guy is a thing of beauty I preciate it and it was you know that we're part of that too be I he didn't say it that way but we're part, of that Tu beat and I never forgot that from that book yeah, it was a relationship right Greenfield or some something like that I I'll have to look up the name of that person but yes Rel his name was Timothy gway there's the book yeah that sounds oh there you go goway yeah he also wrote one on golf too the librarian yeah um so Sensei hit uh hole in one his first time onto a golf course yeah, a story that's not known not well really not known uh I mentioned it to pron who was the historian and he had a iido newspaper something used to write uh magazine and uh he didn't want to hear about this at first cuz it would have of his ideas about how iido developed and uh weren't quite oh sensei's ideas could I say and he so he didn't want to hear this but he being a sort of a reporter he did eventually, check the guy who had been with o Sensei on the golf course uh, was dead but his son was alive he interviewed him and his son laid that same story out that uh, uh yeah um see what add to that um anyway what El told me I'll cut it short was in doing his process and he didn't do his biggest bestest finest process not for a golf course okay uh but he did his process to some degree ho in one and he said to me what else could it could it be so you get your process down right and, these things can happen so what else could it be so again little more advanced level people but yes yeah I mean you couldn't imagine a, a Christ what turning water into wine or something yeah you couldn't imagine a, screw up where suddenly was icky vinegar or something you know what else could it be but pretty damn good tasting wine you know come on you're dealing with the big boys here big boys mean inner finer presence, development me showing that here in the Heavies so of course they look so different and stuff they're from finer in the Heavies yeah but we can get the finer that's all this is about and again whatever level you just want to get a little bit finer to play a better game of golf I'm okay with you guys that's why I used to teach golf I did a little bit teaching with that uh with Michael Murphy and couple others uh no I never gave a about their golf game but if I could get them to settle and open and ground Center natural and, if they found whoa you know yeah I'm getting a feeling here and their golfing was better then they enjoyed that process to get to a level where their stroking was better I was happy not a fantastic jump they're not suddenly spiritual greates but they got to a little better level they weren't Bobby on the golf course anymore they were Roberts heading with the possibility to be a n on the golf course or whatever uh so I would teach some of this dumb uh because the process was important and if they could catch the Simplicity of a process and function a bit better potentially for like a word read hook them or they had yeah words, ah okay where are we where are we where are we [Music] uh, flow h that baby stuff um I don't have a good word for let's say you're a little bit uh down you're tired you're in the doll drums okay we've all we've all been there uh just to remember to get the TW beat going okay yeah it's going there a bit because you're still alive and you can sort of tie your shoes and maybe you can make it to the door before you collapse you know uh but, you're saying if you can remember the TW be boom in whatever form you're going to use it in and out in and out then we refer to sort of a core type here with this at first in and out and uh word that came up to me a couple months ago or something was kind of like a battery that I've got a, small battery and when I go in and out the battery starts to what ignite come alive and I've got that batter's energy force okay but if I continue the Beats I can get to a bigger battery batteries I've got these small batteries in my closet you know that what, what, sizes 2A 3A what's the flashlight battery C's, C double a, c and d the big ones are D okay and, so if you start to pump you reach your D's things start to Glow a bit better okay keep the pump going hit a 12vt battery boom you're on don't stop you're you got it you got it you can stop for the day but come back soon because you've got the beat you've got the beat and you're just using a uh an energy core form of checking this out is did I say that okay that was kind of important did I say it right, yeah so any try it when you're down a bit or something get two beats going okay and at first you're just doing it because you wrote it on your wall if you're down do two beats okay so at first seemingly nothing seemingly nothing but you hang in there and you begin to feel a little bit of something just a little bit of bit of something just a little bit of maybe you're breathing better maybe your body starts to straighten a bit better won't be much in the first few moments potentially but if you're really feeling you can feel the increments feel the in just screwing them around I can feel the increments going on right now more back the spine is a little more distinct right boom that's an I I'm getting Fuller here oops another one just kicked in I suddenly feel my feet flatter on the floor they're actually flat on the floor I can feel that well they were flat on the floor probably all evening but I didn't feel it but now with this beat and feeling the Fuller hair feeling those things I'm experiencing those things my identity is beginning to change I'm not Bobby of the doll drums I'm Robert potentially a AO getting ready to eat dinner function whatever uh stop me before I go crazy here I, think I covered the main things okay another one I used to use uh in my kitchen because elongated right and for some reason I decided walking three four steps forward and then walking backwards three four steps and of course at first the backward walk was a little strange but for some reason I don't remember why this is way back way back I like doing that so I continued with it I get to pretty, quick after a couple of minutes where the walking backwards four steps felt about as comfortable as the walking forward full four steps not quite but pretty damn close pretty damn close then I'd stop and say something like okay like okay what and when it first happened it like sort of caught me by surprise there was such a strong Center there I was strongly, centered and really was quite, a strong Center I was used to being centered played with that but to walk back and forth and suddenly be centered uh heavy duty it kind of caught me by surprise the first time so again see a simple the beat of back and forth and forth and back okay enough who am I in this Cas oo the centered one the obvious is oh I'm a guy who walks better yeah, yeah but let's go a bit deeper who am I really here oh I'm centered okay and then you could add to that and what does the center one do in the world what's his relationship with the world okay or hang out more which being the centered one what do you what do you feel about yourself what's your thought process as the centered one what's your view of things as the centered one and then you can also relate it now's the centered one how's the world with my sense of the world around me kind of thing that's a stupid thing walking back and forth four steps sweet Jesus okay so you can take I say anything stupid as long as it's a has a back and forth or an up and down or a two beat sense to it find the one that you like and eventually you get bored with that one there'll be another one oh gonging gong what's interesting with gonging I was talking you uh G now the, reverse beat is a quiet beat that's in interesting okay but I sense imagine yes it gong out and its return is quiet G and its return is as full covering the same territory but it's quiet okay so its partner is kind of like invisible one or not so audible one but again the same thing after a while would be like you don't just keep gong in the gong who are you who am I and using that as a doorway to the next finer dimension of things and on and on and on so all the forms that are out there the chanting the gonging the breathing the uh jumping through hoops I don't give a use them know what you're doing with them and don't forget that critical better character you and it's a doorway to a finer Dimension next to you I'm pooping out here talk to me I think I've said my main piece talk to me well going say this is Justin I I've, seen I've seen this manifest in the, the center that I work with different types of clients that have different types of challenges and their characters become refined using this approach fascinating but I, really want to highlight something that you said earlier it's a holistic process there, is there's a refinement that's physical emotional mental social situational you said functional and it's, all of that across the board and you we notice something that might be a physical right away when I'm breathing but there are emotional mental social changes that are happening across the board that we may not notice but they're no less relevant yeah they'll be there that's why I tried to bring those out and notice them by saying okay you feel like you're a better character okay well let's check what's your view of the world as a better character do you see things different stuff like that but I like the way you said it the way you brought in all of those five were there all of those are, are there on this basic practice not just physical capability but all the ones that you said say them again there is physical emotional mental social situational you've mentioned spiritual energetic how we relate to our environment it's AC everything, you notice a couple that might be obvious like breathing we're subtle open something but there are all kinds of changes happening simultaneously that might be just more subtle but they're no less real and how they'll manifest themselves in terms of what your character is capable of and as your sensing gets finer hopefully through dimensional finer and finer uh your sensing gets finer you're you pick up those, changes of whichever part of your system emotional or whatever uh you pick those up sooner they're clearer to you at that level so yeah, thank you for that I like the way you worded that somebody we're heading towards, the end here Sensei it's Gina hey Gina you taught me that walking back and forth about 100 years ago and I still use it if I'm gonna like if I'm doing a play backstage to do that back and forth walk and then go on it's just yeah back backstage, in the theater it wouldn't be unusual to see whatever the actress the singer whatever meditating it's really good to be able to just walk and nobody notices what you're doing yeah, yeah but it's worked for you yeah always, yeah thank you yeah cool uh let's see um Lauren have we mentioned we're Tak this is it for December you get a nice break what you should do though if, you have any questions about something maybe I can answer uh so feel free what do we do before Lauren did they send them to your site you send them to me or something that's right they sent them to me so uh if you like to do that Sensei over the holidays we can I can send a notice out and solicit people to write yeah, and uh there'll be no class uh until uh January yeah January 5th January 5th yeah and so, you've got time to under all the great layout that we've been doing and, again see if you have any questions or particular insights or experiences that were great for you uh like Gina is saying you know walking back and forth works every time, wow cool nice, to hear that nice to pass it on to other people so I'll, send out email to everybody and, solicit comments and before we go tonight I'd like to say it's the December 1st which starts the holiday giving season and all gifts to Sensei would be greatly appreciated at this as we enter the month of December and so uh you know the Sensei is not supposed to ask for money himself he's so I'm, doing it for him and so if you can uh I've posted the uh links the same as always uh for making donations they're voluntary but they're very much appreciated and uh they go to a good cause, and so uh with that I'd like to thank Sensei for yet another this is the pretty much the third year the third time we've come into the holidays with these uh online classes and uh I want to thank everybody for sticking with it and of course I want to thank Sensei for yeah you know and we'll see in January by our turnout if we'll continue, and with that I'm GNA gong us out so here we go thank you thank you Sensei wonderful thank you Bob everyone thanks B thank you Lauren and, T out there tech people thank you, very, much thank you everyone have a wonderful year end see you in the new year thank you

## More Space Better Character

**Date:** Unknown date  
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45VjPpL6Uao

do so [Music] do [Music] do so hey [Music], so, [Music] you [Music], and good evening everyone and uh welcome sensei be with us and uh good evening sensei hey, hello good evening people okay i thought we put a good dent in that sense of space last week i'd like to continue with that and uh i'm not sure in retrospect if i like exactly the way i did the write-up more space better character uh that's kind of a basic you know uh a one by one the character in a one by one is that two by two he's ah a little better three by three space ah he's better so that kind of basic but i wanted to uh highlight the earlier of space that the beginnings of creation more original space and then see how it unfolds uh that way okay uh so i might have wanted to change the write-up maybe to, more space a better clearer, unfolding of the creation and of course a better positioning and a better character will naturally happen in, there but i wanted to uh get to an earlier sense of space and then see what's going to show for us tonight did you follow the event [Music] anybody play playing had anybody play played with that this week a, space any, anything just want to chit chat for a moment till the late comers get on any anything, anything uh sensei bob here hey bob what i worked with was not hurrying okay that hurrying through to get to the character and to double up and triple up on the experience, space has of itself okay yeah again tonight i'd like to take it a little bit slower and as things begin to unfold i'm going to ask you not to jump on those too fast it's like yeah we'll get to you and let's continue with more space okay, [Music], so thank you can we do the sitting drive to stand for any reason there's more space it's more space okay i'm going to use the word easy and who i'm talking to is uh the character the bobby robert nadeau that's here, easy, but i'm not sure where i'm going to go with this he's easy that guy space, space itself [Applause], space itself showing that it's here, i don't do space as an idea up there let me think about space i, don't do this little thing up and out there space here, space, that's why i might stand to sort of establish that space is here okay space and so, backtrack a bit uh, space, and the more of space try that out more of space easy [Applause], the more space is here the more original not the most original yet but the more original i feel like i want to stand yeah let me let me understand it just feels like a beat somebody asked me this week uh that when i stand and i do my movement it doesn't matter what i'm talking about i do the same movement as if uh as people don't know what you're doing because you do the same movement maybe okay, okay there are moves i do as bobby the body character and just checking that he's not hanging on too tight so move a little bit this is bobby the character robert the character, uh the person ah moving a bit to let go of any inner holding tension okay so that's this movement, so i don't know what to use my focus is on bobby the character okay and that movement gives me some feedback that bobby the character is beginning to settle his breathing has changes he's opening up, ah okay ah okay so my focus bad word i don't want to focus, my sense of was it was of the character doing this okay then uh historically we've moved along a little more room and after a while the energies that are here at this level these earlier levels the energies begin to present themselves and so my move is acknowledging the energies, ah i'm thinking about at first as an up and down be easy, so i'm referencing the energies starting to get a little bit of an in and out beat okay reference the energies up and down in and out okay so my focus i don't like that word is on the energy level and i'm moving in relation to that okay now, brings us to space easy so i may be doing what looks like the same movement but the focus that word the sense of it is the space the space that's circular that's the flavor i'm getting that it's around here around, here easy space, this is a oh it's showing that it's a bit deeper fuller space is showing deeper and fuller which is real good includes me because i don't do space yes i'm aware of space okay yes i understand space what are we doing okay this is space inwards, acknowledging itself showing itself the movements i'm doing spaces movements charges spaces movements space, okay easy continue here see space i don't know the word finer in finer dimension finer in finer the space is more original so i want to get back quickly to a more original space regional space so i'm moving but my focus backward my sense is just a space so i'm not doing the bobby character moving around to get out of it and get it more into ah or the movement of the energies okay this is space so i'll start to gain in the early stages of space showing that it's there easy circular you okay with circular easy i don't know if i'm exactly in the middle of it now but it's heading that way space, space, space circular space a sense of a deeper fuller, circular space okay space and i want to move from there and continue this sense of let's see if we can head into the very early beginning of space being present i think we can do that sitting now okay easy, space easy space, as the damn words as space unfolds and shows that it's here for you as space [Applause] shows that it's here as space this, sense of a circle space is a thing itself any first sense of what you hear sense here, about space [Applause], okay for example believe i heard many things can go on here oh okay maybe eventually say everything can go on here but i'm just telling you where i'm at with it many things can go on here oh okay ah somebody want to jump in the early stages of self at space itself talking about itself as space we're still sort of backtracking a bit to the more original of space somebody are jumping on space itself experiencing itself as space says about itself now when i say that let me think about that what would it say i i'm not doing that the sense the sense listening space talking space itself says about itself easy and easy it's for the worried work oh can i hear anything when i say the right thing, that's the guy i'm talking easy, talking to that one space itself it seems uh since it seems somehow softer and open okay [Applause], i like the word open here not that soft is bad i just i just happen to like right now the word open i am space i am here and i am very open oh i am very open and started coming back on me with my earlier one and many things can happen here many possibilities here whatever i said, and it says uh something is tying those two together it's saying in this openness i'm open to many things going on, eventually probably everything that's going on but this is where i'm at now i'm open i'm open i am space i am open ah somebody continuing space experiencing itself it says i am active okay, now, i don't want to get too fast into the activity of it i really want to continue with just the space yes we'll come back on that right i don't want to get oh what's the activity, and then i, haven't really followed space out to its earlier early beginnings as space because i got caught up in the activities but yes, but let's not go for that now so yes i'll get back to you but continue with space itself [Applause] it seems to me to be the original i am a part of that ah okay ah okay we have to be careful with i am because uh i'm not sure how people will take that are we talking about the self talking about some original unnameable god i am um but okay, as long as we don't start going off on different things but okay and easy space, space itself easy space itself hi i have i have uh, a feeling of like mice at this two kinds of spaces like it's my space which is the circle and it's a bubble like i'm in a bubble and then there's another space with everything outside of me, it's like a duality that's my feeling okay i i'm sorry i can't quite follow the image in there but whatever easy if so it'll come back again and show again and say hey i'm important we'll pick it up no problem i can't do anything with that right now it doesn't mean it's wrong it's just doesn't mean easy continuing space the more original of space, the more original of space more original of space easy easiest dumb bobby, easiest on my ideas and reaching forward so easy, this is just space itself sense of supportiveness and support, yeah so it's, a trust that sort of trust i've got you okay and again nothing wrong but i've got you a job oh it's not me i, i don't want everybody i don't know if you said that uh i'm not letting go letting go letting go yeah easy i'm not dealing with bobby and what he's got to hang on to for his sanity and, how to establish himself hanging on is not easy with that, guy space, space okay a dumb story line came to me muddling on this was a goldfish as if i'm a goldfish i'm in water, at different temperatures and, different ways the tides beat in the water, but what i'm going for now is the bowl as space as space the bowl ass face so if you say anything that sounds like what the goldfish is thinking feeling whatever i'm not interested in goldfish right now i'm not interested in any of the energies, at these earlier levels i want a really highlight the bowl the bowl the space okay so if i'm cutting anybody off it's not because you're wrong it's like maybe not yet or the way you presented it maybe everyone else could understand i couldn't quite i couldn't, quite i couldn't add to it or say anything intelligent about it doesn't mean it's wrong okay space itself and a sense of that earlier the beginnings of space people say it that way the beginnings of space in the beginning and the space itself again for lack of words experiences is aware and experiences itself it's not a empty nothing right okay, as space as space it has a sense of itself it's aware of itself as uh there's a clearing sensor clearing like it's un untouched it's clean, innocent sort of what i was getting it's innocent yeah certainly nothing's happened yet except space so it's very clean or clear all right so i asked if anyone caught on to activity no, not yet let's get to this more original clear place and then we'll sort of come back on it and see how it lays out this is the beginning of creation and here's boom space one of the very early i don't want to say the first thing that's there but damn early damn, early space used to practice talking to things so, for example i might say okay space very early space what's your claim to fame sort of meaning uh what's your job what's your designation uh so just to get sort of the conversation going with it [Music] bob if you were to say to your face here or the space that's there hey what do you do what's your claim to fame whatever, what might you what are you hearing i provide a context for whatever is going to go on could you change words for me instead of context, and not that it's wrong just give me another word for that a an energy no i can't use energy a location that allows a focus for what's going to go on in a supportive way yeah so could we say in this circular uh sphere, uh gives you a, location gives you a, location gives you a something and then things are going to go on and unfold and show how it came from original and how the energies and then out of that and where characters came from it's going to lay itself out okay so whatever you need first before uh, something can lay itself out here in this space remember that yeah, yeah yes whoa remember big 11th we come up with a good languaging for space we're doing the best we can bear with us anything you're hearing from space, hey i'm picking up here for you i think florida was on [Music], i'm picking up a sense of availability um space is available, to participate collaborate available for the potential of things an availability sense of inviting almost [Music], availability this word's coming up for me a lot okay if we come in smaller and go from a one byte to a two byte to a three by four then space is available now in the beginnings let's say beginning one of the not necessarily the first thing but one of the very first, thing but one of the very first things was the space in which creation is going to go on it's always been available from, the get-go space has been space available it's just there can i say it that way it doesn't clash with you and he does it okay and come back to tight again bobby robert now go one by two by three by guy whatever, uh space is there if i got boxed in and i'm hanging on to the box and then it might be hard for me to realize the space because i'm sort of inward hanging on easy, easy and it's like unclench from hanging on to robertville or bobbyville the space that's there begins to show and in that bigger space three by three freer breathing the beginnings of a different character he who breathes fuller he who thinks a little bit clearer he who would like to be a little straighter ah he would like to stretch out a bit not a whole bunch yet that heavy gamble but we'd like to try something out a little bit uh, the space is always there always there so in, catching the bigness the early of it could facilitate coming back here into the lobster trap of manifest creation and the vortex spiral we got into uh, having a little better sense of space coming from this way okay so by trying to pick it up and get a sense experience of it and it's more original could facilitate bobby robert nacho whatever getting it having more facility with it so that makes sense okay an original space okay let's see can we get anything more out of space or have we reached our limit here with it anybody more just like justin a very strong feeling of availability of um of, newness um, yeah, can you hear me yeah, partially newness yeah, yeah so this is a more original space now, we're starting all over again here first we're starting from the beginning so it's very new here are the beginnings first, one of the first things was well we need some space and then and i want to see how it lays out what's going to go on in the space but i just want to make sure we had enough space am i saying that right a sense of it the early of space the beginning of space are we okay i'm checking with brad right we okay yeah, okay, and at the moment we can't do anything more with it but i would suggest if you're interested in space that you get to this level and you hang out more out more with that sense of a more original space at the beginnings space easy, more original space, a more the more original space and you hang with it and, and, i don't say get better with it hang with that so it's not just an idea but it's a but it's a, sense experience of that, the space itself is having with itself, like, having uh with itself is the, clearness, or the or the emptiness the phobia that seeming uh allowingness of it hang out there for a bit if you're interested we're just quickly going through, some patterns if they catch your attention it's up to you to spend time with segments of the pattern to really get versed and to get versed experientially with them okay, very important okay, otherwise i could just sit here and lecture and lay out the map in 10 minutes and say okay you got it unless you actually practice all you've got is some mental idea knowledge and nothing's going to come of it to speak of okay so if it's space it's experiencing itself it's a thing itself don't have the right words there feel what the space is feeling it's feeling itself you feel with this feeling but i don't feel anything i, rub my skin and i don't feel like i don't mean feeling sensing, the experience it's having with itself if it says it's clear say, then sense feel that clearness hang with that sense the clearness should i say be clear i don't mean bobby be clear i don't mean that but what it's experiencing experience, sorry the words are lousy here you got a sense are we okay, okay now, okay last week it started to come up some of you started to talk about the activity i, don't know if we can do anything more right now with the expansiveness of the first space okay so let's start uh i don't know say work our way in i really don't mean that too tightly but what's going on in the space let's say for example last week somebody said oh it seems like it's alive yes it's all alive okay in that great space there is a liveness, cool okay now you in the great space what's going on it's a great space click what's next i have a sense of a beat of expansion contraction okay over there a beat can i say in and out for okay a beat okay easy so, first in the space easy it seems like it's beating right there said let me think about that again, like towards the experience of it feel the beats because the beats are feeling themselves as one of the for him first things that is happening in this space easy i'm just see the beats don't just be aware of the beats for lack of words experience the beats as they would be experienced within the space ah the words okay experience the beach there might be much more depth to the beach, there might be much more something in the beach oh yeah the reading i got it i saw it i'm aware of it, you missed a lot you missed a lot you missed a lot you missed a lot the beats are beating themselves experiencing themselves as beats you can hang there for a while on your own time having the experience of the beast what are the right words i'm sorry i can never come up with the right words the beach experiencing themselves as speech sometimes i like to dialogue with things when i'm hanging out oh uh, what do you do i see you're beating and i'm feeling your beating could you clarify a bit better what you do what your purpose is and it said something right i like i'm kind of like a heartbeat when it starts beating this thing is beginning the whole, thing is starting to come alive not bobby's heart we're talking about this massive first space of creation but it threw that at me as an example oh that's kind of like a heartbeat it's the it's the aliveness of whatever what's going on here, uh that this creation is going to be a very alive creation and i'm the first indication, i beat and you get a sense of the aliveness, somebody else will say oh i didn't i didn't pick up uh it that way but i have a sense it's all alive you, said the same thing same thing both you guys how can i both you people whoever you said the same thing but in a little different angle on it you see oh there's no heartbeat there it's alive but there's no heartbeat no, it's not alive it's a heartbeat stop it you damn fools meaning people kind stop it stand with that dumbness easy, easy, really feel it really feel it and you'll sort of feel what the other person's talking about because you're very similar, if you're at a similar place you're similar, okay if you're in a one by one and i'm in a five by five hard for us to talk to each other about our experience but if we're anywhere near each other's like oh yeah, anyway in this space the beginnings of activity okay so we've got a b somebody else creation should be unfolding here to me it feels like uh possibilities are sort of almost coming into existence like uh very light very light and then and then not much happens yeah okay, let's just think boom possibilities yeah my sense of the creation for whatever is endless possibilities okay so the space said what's going to go on here, it's alive and there are endless possibilities later we'll catch on to the variety of ways the energy works the different vibration rates what it can mix and create but yeah, a lot of possibilities kind of thing okay somebody at your space and then something begins to happen in the space let's say this is tj sir, so, what i get what i get is um in, the beautiful space that you create when you do that process is that there is a that original space or that original transparency holds or embraces the, activity space is not active in itself if i can say and but, there is activity there is energy moving in within it yes so how you said uh energy or, vitality aliveness is happening, in space i think that's an that's really important because for me that clarifies as we're talking about the clarity of space, it clarifies that, i'm not identifying with uh the activity or the, space i'm allowing both things to take place so space is happening, activity and energy is happening and that's part of the unfoldment yes yeah, so i think what we're trying to do here, me and tj are saying okay the space is the space that's a particular thing can i say now the activity that goes on in the space is the activity and there'll be probably different levels of that activity certainly within the space yes okay so space is face its own unit it's aware of itself sensing itself whatever the right words are in the universal creation science space this is the unfolding yes yeah i like that i like the unfolding first because it's cropped up is the aliveness factor within the space and then we'll see when and then we had and it seems to okay it's alive and that beat seems important we'll see how that lays out and we continue so we're letting it unfold, within this creation size space where letting creation unfold is what we're trying to do here yeah, yeah, and i think that, distinction is going to be more and more important when, we start to really look at the at character and uh the movement the, shifts of levels or, uh dimensions in a one by two by three by and beyond um so, that you don't get wrapped up or, spun down into any particular, well i'm the i'm the space and i'm the energy, if we if we have some, openness there with that the sense of, transparency as i was that's the word i was using i think that contributes to the unfolding yeah i also want to add an airline trying to remember it uh what i was going to say because i get thoughts and they're gone the next minute so uh, uh yeah if we think the space is starting to move and starting to do this and starting to do this then when it gets you down into your one by one two by two whatever uh you know there's no space no, those are the, energy level within all of this that's a bit tighter but space, that grandness of space is still there yes, yeah but if you get into it i got no space and this is the only truth i really locked in period boom they know [Music] it's the energy movement tight and whatever tricks we use that easy, easy acknowledge their space here you were in a one by one yeah yes we know and somehow we play games of being facilitating our movement into a two by two take advantage of the more space that slower away but the grand space is still going on it doesn't matter how tight you get the original space is still the original, space is still the original space spacing right tj right on thank you oh people where are we okay so okay so uh so let's see we got some kind of aliveness some kind of beat here it is unfolding people next what are you getting cnc there still wants to be a sense of for me a sense of harmony between the space and the unfolding so it still wants there's a one sort of there's a growth together there's a development together okay didn't maybe so maybe so i might like to separate them there is space and within the space there is something, harmoniously going on i may not say this original space is going to be in harmony with what's going, to be in harmony with what's going on because after a while what's going on uh might get uh smaller in the manifest creation uh but, i think you have the right sense, so that's the way i would say it yet okay, and again people hiss might be right on it's talking to me this is how i would sense that or lay that out okay i'm saying yes within the space he's getting a sense of harmony i think that could be really cool because that's related to the beats for example and see we're at the stage here where, we needed a space in the beginnings of creation now continuing to create we need two forces, one fourth thing can create properly here can't create okay so this twos this yin yang male female uh ha ho uh whatever you want to call it, had to go into two forces to then to then uh dimensionally create, at those levels, you're following me here so yes it will show some kind of harmony here but i would for general leo i would figure ah it's showing a harmony exists within the space at whatever this level of energies in whatever form it's showing yes there's harmony, between, so it may be starting to show its two-beat pattern okay let's move along somebody as it lays out how is it laying out for you yeah oh let me go back again and go back again remember what me and tj said uh, about space and space and now we're getting this activity that's not the space you see you see and you said uh there's a space and now it's something is active in their relationship but again i think me and tj are a little closer there is a space and within the space click is aliveness within the space next click oh there's some kind of harmonious beat okay, so space is space the beats are the beats within space but it's not the space is to be the space is the heat now you can major in it spend more time with it with it and if i'm off you tell me but you spend time experientially with it and see how it lays out for you then we can dialogue it somebody within the space things are beginning to lay out unfold what's your sense where are you here now no noah jump in for me support what you and teaser were saying about the space i, remember a client i had a work that made test tubes and things like that for laboratories and their big claim to fame was they absolutely guaranteed there was nothing in these test tubes that would buy us research there were no bacteria there was nothing so whatever happened inside the test tube was happening because of the, stuff in the tube yeah because space was utterly pure and that was an iron-clad guarantee that they made that's a cute angle on it yes thank you okay did he get you going it's starting to unfold within this space yes it's alive yes there seems to be some kind of beats seems to be some kind of harmony people is there a start to a center like a start to a point like that sort of yeah see it's possible oh good oh good in the beginning now again we're getting a little bit past my pay grade here okay but in the beginning it all pulled in the unnamable pulled in for some reason decided to create god knows why that's his business unnameable, and, boom now for me my understanding so far again get close to my paid grade level uh was a great a great space okay i'm not saying it was first but it was damn close a great space and in this spacing could be from center out to a circle and back again okay there's your original, which we call that two beats your original two beats now we have to be careful because we're still in the of the manifest and we use two beats here but it doesn't mean the two beats i use are those two beats, but if you get used to two beats as robber and realize the two beats help you get to, uh, nado whatever, whatever two bye to a three bye whatever, good, good really get the flavor there because it's a great warm up eventually, hopefully, you'll be able to touch the more original, at which time boom taboom could quite likely be so okay, yeah, now, uh the reason i don't push a lot on that core, center style is because it's for me there seems to be people tend to go more aware of a core thing and, and they don't get a fuller feeling that's why i like the deep ground root sense okay, keep going for the deeper roots as i move along dimensionally i go for the deeper roots so i also like a core holla style but i'm afraid too many people become aware of it and, they don't get roots they don't get the depth and the fullness therefore they're going to miss something therefore they're eventually going to get spun out what a shame they've done so much work and to get spun out into back to something lesser what a shame so i hope i didn't confuse you too much with that but yeah it could be so yes okay in this great space things are presenting things are showing themselves things are unfolding what's your sense what, comes to you what comes to you where are you in this layout what comes to you okay i'm getting a sense of order orderly or ordinance or order, or order, organizational thing okay, yes and this is uh not a new one uh, organizational uh i think last week one of you was picking something like this up when we're using a stadium as a rep for the great space and you're picking up the uh the, lines on, a football field or baseball field or certain lines designations kind of thing somebody out there brought that to my attention last week he's getting, his version of that there's something orderly here okay, all right in oh sensei's uh version uh let me see if i remember the words here grid, grid uh, but something presented me with the word grid, that it sort of kind of like lays out like a grid orderliness order and its partner is particles uh i, envision it like a bunch of little cubby holes okay and its partner is that particle that, fills those little slots, okay that eventually probably break down with something like i have an idea okay and now the energies begin to gather and come back to support that idea that would be a smaller version of that, are you following me am i getting too, fancy here okay so a type of orderliness say yeah somewhere or to other yes hang with that see the more of how it would lay out on your own time it's interest you spend time with it get back to that same level and, hang with it for a while give it a chance to lay itself out clearer, to share its secrets with you so to speak, easy, you see you see let it present let it explain let it gush out okay, i don't know am i am i spinning around too much potentially there are no secrets in the universe you're not hanging out and whatever you're hanging out with will realize you're friendly and will lay out its secrets okay you're my buddy whatever you need i'll give you the best i can it's not just knowledge oh yeah i understand that yeah i read the book yep that's nice but there's no experience, actual, anyway so, somebody, it's unfolding here we are in this great space, next that, happens that happens now wherever you are in there what's unfolding for you what's going on in the space sensei t-shirt yeah sorry if i may uh um what i'm what i'm getting quite interestingly here given the, feeling of allowing space to feel itself so to speak, it when we come into those pulses is starting to reveal lineage for me yeah and so i'm starting in that it's not just a big amorphous uh, vast potential which of course it is but i'm, connecting then with some elements of lineage of my, lineage uh the character yeah and, and how that's starting to form through those beats through the mixing remixing yeah okay uh, i wanted to slow people down but yes uh and have them get a sense there for a while sorry and let's see lcr so in my temporary map i call uh, all the early activity so you've got your space now you've got this early activity and something seems to beat and then it's all alive and, and there seems to be a, grid and particles or uh orderliness and whatever partner is for brad, yes, yes, yes, in on the map i'm temporarily using now on page two the continuation of this now it starts to set up because of the beats, starts to set up the soon to be character that's there okay not a bobby robert character remember we're very early we're, very early in the game here okay but from what i can hear tj saying he's starting to catch oh uh, it's mixed excuse you could you jump in again it's, mixing yeah it's mixing the, feeling of the lineage of life of a lineage yeah, because of how you yeah how you entered for the creation that you entered yes all right, you pick certain things qualities okay and then click, click now the qualities are starting to form and we'll mix up create a character that's right okay now i wouldn't at this size we're at uh um mix up a heavy character like a bobby thing i'd be more into the character of uh archetype type sets right what is what's the pure quality of the lineage yes, because you're in a much original finer place so don't give me well bobby moves his arm that way come back here we're, at the very early beginning place it's like replaying for you creation okay let it replace so we can position ourselves better because we are going to end up eventually back into this, but you'll be so much better positioned with a much better sense of how things work, that we ought to be able to move very quickly through this manifest vortex horrible thing we got caught up into, potentially getting tighter and tighter and tighter okay uh so did we cover tj yeah i think so the, that purity say for me might be uh not about this particular character of tj although it has it has a resonance with it but i'm, feeling in the pulse i'm feeling the line of beauty i'm feeling the line of that oh, have we heard that word before Teja i don't think so ever before and guess what here it here it's not too beautiful, it's just it's just beautiful, real, quick uh, many years ago it was quite a few years back right i in the 80s yeah and i was doing some uh practice with Teja, and i sort of had him somehow got him to the beginnings of creation and creation starts to unfold and i'm sort of expecting him to like move into it or something and he says it's too beautiful it could it was too beautiful for him to move into there was too much Teja there in Teja was unable to move into such grand beauty so that's why we're joking with each other uh and you and you say you, said you stopped me and said i thought this was your lineage thought this i thought this was what you're about here you too beautiful one of your majors it was a huge lesson it was just profound life-changing listen very good i remember people you have more than one quality okay but i knew that was uh whatever it was obvious to me that was a major a major not the major or the only major but one of them okay we'll come around back on qualities again but again you see it as things condense in, you still have qualities but the lesser form, you know so you're kind of good looking but you're not really beautiful and if you're the human standards beautiful, but it's not uh, anyway admit qualities are dimensional also okay all right so i get a little uh sad when humans say oh love as if they've got the totality of the original love because they can say that word i'm not putting you down but i am saying i'm a little sad when you overdo it and make off like you got it, that's a human sense of love so i made jokes about the human sense of love you love me until i eat your twinkies, at which time you hate my ass i've been through this before people with you all okay so that's my a bit that they learn a word and make it everything and they haven't really experienced it and the more of it and the more original of it you learning a word memorizing the word liking the word uh is that's good but, it's still finger related it's not the moon, [Music], i'm starting to understand what that means finger pointing to the moon uh anyway okay you all say something i'm gonna go crazy here, it's unfolding okay so okay following jesus uh as you let it show that's alive and that there's some kind of harmonious beat there, uh, last week somebody brought up intelligent it felt like it was all intelligent i said yeah cool and somebody brought up another word is that personality or the other another word intelligent and what you remember i don't remember no anyway so yes, yes, i hang there for a bit and then as it as it continues its movement uh because we have two forces now and uh qualities at that level are mixing up uh what's going to become a person but forget that person now it's mixing up a character on, lineage okay, yes so it wouldn't surprise me if tj through many lifetimes in some form or other in many of those lifetimes had some sense of beauty okay either because he was a beautiful person or a beautiful lady or, painted beautifully or played beautifully or, had a life where he was ugly and, wanted beauty and he didn't have it and that was his throughout that whole life there's no beauty everything is ugly oh so can spin around in reverse so you get all that nonsense, am i splaying around too much for y'all anyway we'll, go over qualities another time where are we okay as it continues to move then the possibility of, the energy's mixing to create a character but remember again we're at the more beginnings of creation here uh so don't, go into the body level at the beginnings of creation jesus said it well the sense that he was on lineage he sort of recognized somehow how the, activities and the sense of things there were, related to him on lineage yeah cool, and just hang there for a while somebody where are you in this activity of creation so i'd say one of the things i remember you're saying you heard from well sensei kind of supporting this, whole thing about lineages is that this kind of selection of lineages by each of us happened very, early in the creation he called it a soaking at that time to that very early uh probably this page one that we're talking about here where there's energy and there are qualities there uh, some, a couple of you started to bring it up last week one said intelligence yes all intelligence yes quality uh and somebody threw out another word that was pretty good i don't remember what it was now but right here all these qualities are available and we individually were attracted to some again a little bit past my pay grade but something like uh we're attracted to and we, soaked in qualities it became four that we really liked and started to at this level this very advanced level uh and, uh and, liked that and what to say uh and so i had a pattern that stayed with us as we got in and in and then we still carry a sense of those qualities but maybe you lost some or, got into the lesser coloring because almost like as we go in tighter the colored shade a bit one way of saying it maybe in the more original really, really wow live vibrant uh i'm running out of words there plus becoming tighter and tighter uh you still got qualities but maybe they're fading a bit okay i can like somebody but i really can't love them because i, can't quite get into that level i can lie something out like that the loving fades into a liking fades into a sometimes i like sometimes i don't uh it could even go really sort of where i don't like anybody at all every uh but the qualities are there as we settle in open even starting from bobby robert our sort of basic pattern one by the two by three by the qualities that are there will begin to show themselves at their better level their better vibrational level uh the, the stronger of them the brighter of them the purer of them come up with your own damn words so we can work our way back that way here i jumped you to the beginning to see how you picked it up from the beginning you can replay the beginning, you can replay the beginning you, have the capability of doing that, okay, to some degree you have the capability of doing that that's what we're doing ah let's see anybody want to jump in with anything, in the unfolding here in this space, anything at whatever level you're at wherever you're at the unfolding want to talk about love uh that's what's okay unfolding for you yeah, yeah, um and uh i, really uh i really feel it a little bit like what you were saying it doesn't seem that related to oh i love you or i'm in love with this person it's this real pervasive um okay now kenny talk to me from a bit of an experience of that you're starting to come out here and be on your lectern, okay, okay so there you are space is starting to spaces there and it's starting to unfold and as you [Music] get involved with the unfolding whoa there is loving there now for you there, is loving there now for you there how are you sensing experience that loving that's there now talk you know like, it's hard to say other than osensei uh said you know all pervasive through the universe um and i not that not that i'm you know owning that but, uh that it's, not a per it's not a personal thing the universe loves us when we're on our path so uh it can't be taken away from you it doesn't require an object it just is yeah and it's kind of like the space i can get boxed in but it doesn't mean the space got bought space is still there, love, still there harmony still there harmony still there okay, so i get so i get sad when people spinning so tight they can't make a move because they're spending so tight what a shame that's what we're trying to get people out of there one by one some form of hope and so they have a chance a chance a chance to experience the reality of everything spaces, beauty is beauty is love is power is it's also there but it gets funny and you can't quite catch it uh yeah all that nonsense the human condition i call that yeah anyway kenny uh just on as a teacher practice talking from the experience okay, [Music] [Applause] now let me tell you about breathing outward, i got you, got it yeah, yeah and now breathing outward it seems like the better i inhale the cleaner fuller the outward breath is that's an experience i'm talking from okay, yeah could you see it yeah okay oh yeah, i, think that's kind of important anyway uh people reaching the end here anybody get anything out of this [Applause], science fiction practice you're at the beginning here's a great space now i meant to but i'm not going to say if we how it works in your sense of a character even if you come into a you know unless a manifest character robert not or whatever, uh, still that sense of positioning better i think should be there that sense of better of how things work so like your sense of space should, be oh yeah space that you can, tap it real fast because it's there uh, just should give you a better sense by coming in that way should give you a better sense of oh, whatever that means mate okay, all right it's right around here when we're hitting, uh character uh when, i think i think when a stronger vortex spins started to happen or i could get caught up in tighter and tighter and tighter, in my vernacular be an ape if i could have gone tighter i would have become a rock but i got stopped along the way enough so down to my weird bobby, robert uh so it's right around here where type vortex, happens, uh i don't know if you need to know that anyway just a creation reference uh anything for finisher no i'm out of here thank you very much sensei thanks for hanging out hope you've done something thank you everybody thank you thank you thank you so much thank you sensei thank you lauren night everyone thanks ting thank you

## Harmony to Balance

**Date:** Unknown date  
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtWd6W4iLwM

Harmony to balance old standby topic but I want to add a little more advanced level with it so Harmony to balance I've got two different styles of looking at things uh one there's sort of a center to Circle uh style the others upper half lower half the idea of things the functionality or the actual energy experience of things uh so you use those two as sort of a reference Maybe I would think just bullshitting for a bit that bit that if I'm not in accord with myself or I'm not if I'm not in harmony with myself that's going to be hard to be in harmony with anybody or anything else if I'm out of sorts I'm going to be out of sorts okay uh, that's we're just to start the conversation any comments Harmony help Sensei this is Justin my um my, sense of Harmony involves a give and a take a partnership of, beings forces Etc and there's a give and a take okay and volunteer okay now he's talking about his person and the other person and using that as a reference okay uh fine no problem but we also have just personal you alone Harmony you with your own uh true forces in whatever form is comfortable natural uh, the types of, the ways the types of forces you may choose for example uh there could be a an inhale exhale beat and you like to use that and as you continue and settle and open with that with that there's more Harmony between the in and out, okay brings us to a point of balance okay somebody else may like movement okay I turn to the left and then I turn to the right and after a bit there's more Harmony the left and right turns start to sort of equalize each other hey and that brings us to a point of balance uh so but what should we call that uh the personal form of Harmony at first all right but somebody Harmony what's, harmony mean for you what's, your sense since I teach you here teacher there all right, um of course Harmony has a whole different sense for me as a musician it is uh it is the alignment uh or the relationship of notes uh and there and the way that, expresses, in a Melody more than just a single a single note it has depth that has Dimension has qualities of beauty those sorts of things um but uh but Harmony I I'm interested to take a step back from where uh Justin started which is a great place to start but interested in why you would say Harmony to balance and not balance to Harmony and perhaps if you said something about that, would clarify a little bit more about what Harmony is in uh in the way that they're talking about it all right oh Sensei told me that the harmony part is the movement forces those forces that are in the two beat of things, the great ying and the great Yang the great he the great she the great idea the great functionality whatever, the movement and when there's any Accord at whatever level of Harmony between your choice of the style of movement you want to use uh okay uh that he called that balance so I'm just bouncing off of his words okay but he did say Harmony is the moving part the things that move if that means anything to you yeah it means a lot oh good it, it kind of um speaks to the, to the way things move and develop so if I'm using a musical sense of vibration, uh frequency that sort of thing and look for harmony it's not just in a single place it is a development that takes place and so now I understand a little bit more about why you say Harmony to balance, um, and not the other way around not that it can't be the other way around but you know yeah know yeah well Sensei if this is Lauren enough I could just jump in yeah I've been uh you've often done practices in on the math Sensei of you know left right you know lift your right hand lift your left hand eventually they become more equal more balanced you know or up down uh you know and, I tend to find that it goes from balance myself to Harmony Sensei told me okay but I wanted to add he talked about Harmony and music but what I also wanted to say is that Harmony seems Dynamic it's not static in other words it's not it's moving it's, always changing and adjusting yeah and uh and so it's, the sense that it's not fixed it's not static you don't achieve it and then it's like locked yeah it's remember, people we're in dimensionality and as soon as Bobby is comfortable then boom activity starts and is trying to be a Robert and as soon as Robert's comfortable Boone is on and if I hang out there properly there's a not though and again a Sensei and again or whatever, it's moving because it's dimensionality mm-hmm, yeah of course so essentially there's dimensionality in uh in that aspect of Harmony that you're talking about now uh there's also to kind of pick up a little bit on what Lauren was saying that uh that, Harmony is not static you're talking about uh Harmony being moving but balance is the same way isn't it because I mean that's my experience that balance is not a fixed State you know only when we use the, teeter-totter thing and it's exactly in the middle and stopped there for a moment, so um but as a as a movement I think you, said something about osensei talking about, people asking or someone maybe you or someone asked him do you ever lose your balance and he said yes but I recover it so fast you don't see I yeah I don't know if that was my story or somebody else's I'm blank yeah I mean me too I don't remember sorts of that but it makes sense that, when, there is, um the qualities of Harmony present in its multi-dimensional possibilities that uh that moving in and out of balance is uh is possible even in its flock even in the fluctuations yeah because situational change the balance will change yeah, that's beautifully said we'll say and it's changing pretty frequently right all the time as far as I could tell thank you for that yeah anyway what we're going to how we're going to up it tonight this uh okay we've been talking about Harmony and balance or whatever, for load these many years okay what I wanted to uh bring it cross clarify add-on is DM how to utilize this game of using my terminology Harmony to a point of balance where both those forces feel like they're okay with each other and maybe we'll do some old simple exercises in a moment okay and at that point of balance bear with me on my words okay oftentimes we're happy to be better balanced, and we say oh there I feel better I'm not at odds with myself right now I feel better I'm okay with myself and we stopped there because it's better than not being okay with yourself which you were in our day before all right all right but I want to say at that balance point let's also call that a doorway an opening a uh what's, the other word Bob what's the other word I use there uh that it's a portal to the next underlying dimension okay oftentimes we get balanced and because it's better than being unbalanced we say oh great leave me alone, and I'm saying well if you have a little more time let's trade it in for the underlying level and experience that level let's use the balance as a doorway portal introduction lead into the next dimension, okay, yes, and I think I've never quite said it as clearly in the past as I'm trying to as I'm trying to say it now okay, uh is uh Ross Madden on tonight no son Ross if you're on stage he is not a present okay I wanted to mention okay I'm going to talk about Ross behind his back uh some sessions back uh we're playing with something uh probably some kind of harmonious Vibe we got to a better level and I said okay uh who are you and Ross say oh this is nice this harmony is nice I said okay who are you he said I'm a nice guy uh and I pushed on him a bit I said now, who are you let me continue I'm a nice guy okay so that was the balance of the level of Harmony he got through with whatever practice we were doing and what I would say now to him is be prepared if you have the time and the energy be prepared or the desire for more okay the time the energy or the desire for more be prepared to trade that in for the next underlying finer dimension of beingness okay whatever precedes nice guy so nice guy is great point of balance okay he was aware he was experiencing nice, good beautiful balance point beautiful doorway beautiful portal now Zoom inner finer, the next level experiencing aliveness could I say of the next level and then for example the character who are you at this level and you're going to be somehow a superior to the nice guy whatever that means are you following what I'm trying to say yeah okay so uh okay so uh there's a tendency with humans let's say you've been nervous and you do a little practice and you're calm thank God I'm calm, there's a tendency for the humans to stop there okay one reason might be they don't want to gamble that there's something more because they don't want to lose the calmness, so for whatever reason people tend to hit a certain level and hang on to it for dear life uh so to have a sense there's more how the more Works to have a, desire for more a pull for more whatever the right words are there uh okay to continue to continue anybody want to bounce back on anything there it's Justin again I, think one thing that, keeps us humans from growing is, the experience of comfortableness we reach a level of comfortable and like you're saying that's, for all intents and purposes good enough and we might linger there for a long, time and really not grow that much at that at that point yeah, it especially shows in an astral plane where it's where the harmony hum gets finer and finer and whoa this is very nice at those levels there's a tendency I call it hammock space for them to go into a hammock space they got it made there's no body pain there's no work to be done per se okay so I just hang out at that level when there's so much more so much more yeah [Music], uh here in the human world uh, there's a possibility that you'll get bumped you know uh so whatever you're saying just in a certain level and say this is great you're great but then you're a grandchild gets sick with an incurable disease and that throws you or all of your Investments turned out bad and you, lose all your money and that throws you so it's possible in The Human Condition uh for something to break the bank there all right or if you luck out in a human way of looking at things you have enough money to sustain you through retirement or nobody in your family gets sick nobody, in your family gets sick nobody dies, nothing bad happens in The Human Condition that's, not so there but anyway blah, somebody where the hell are we here since they teach you again uh yeah you and I have talked about this and we've talked about it generally but all as a meditation teacher and so-called mindfulness teacher um many people are drawn to different kinds of practices yes yeah um so they are drawn let's say let's say to meditation, or to mindfulness because they hear uh yeah you can gain you can calm your anxiety and uh and just become a calmer more centered person and all those the claims are true because the, if one sincerely does the practices in the right way with the correct guidance and so on you can you can uh connect with the domain of calmness and a lot of people will just stick there I think you said that earlier in your reference they'll stick there because they're not willing to, give up what if, I go beyond that in my meditation practice will I lose my calmness while that sense of centeredness so I just wanted to bring that up because that's a another aspect in working with um with meditation uh same as in any art uh Aikido or any of the other any, art whatsoever yeah there you go uh yeah uh so the different forms uh what roughly what is it uh hang on artistic there could be they could be artistic forms of course and uh and there's also you know our, person who you came on leadership once you gain a certain quality you might want to stop there because in order to go to the next so-called level you kind of in some ways you have to let go of yes you have to let go of what you've already attained you know and you're comfortable whatever, and you in your trading in for the next you let go of that you don't know it first if you're going to have an audience when you come back from your uh inner Retreat could I call it sure of course yeah I think it's a good that's good you don't know what you're going to say yet you don't know how you're going to present yet you don't know if anybody's going to be there so you hang on to your group at that level, so by the way uh that is one thing that can hold teachers back yeah, uh they get stuck, sure the level of their students which is yes work with these students at their level but you continue to develop uh but a lot of them don't, because they don't want to lose that what they got their group yeah I gotta practice just in order to keep up with my students you know so that's good and of course and, and continue my for my own development if I wasn't interested in, meditation or Aikido or any of the any of the Arts that I'm interested in uh you know would be it wouldn't be authentic you know I wouldn't be coming I wouldn't be a, genuine teacher we've talked about this also uh in terms of Aikido the um uh folks will get to a certain degree like knee down or uh Sundown or something like that I can remember from my own experience with you, said yeah I was asking what I needed to do for the next for the next level and you said uh you know continue to, open to let go and open and I said yes but what should I do he said continue to let go and open so it's hard because you have to let go of the things that you already know in order to really genuinely move into a more uh to a deeper finer uh greater capacity level yeah and it's again people it's scary to people yeah, until you begin to catch the trick of how it works then you sort of don't mind letting go for the next and don't mind letting go for the next because it's, we've tried to shown that in our earlier classes uh that one level certain something next level a bit better Easy Next Level oh that's even nicer I said that's it that's it you got the pattern it doesn't change but they don't know that or if they're on their Journey enter a much finer call it involved with more things showing uh that they misunderstand instead of no this is a level easy let it unfold until you're comfortable there actually uh anyway so it's a typical people thing two this that we're talking about to be afraid of letting go of what you got for the next exactly and learning how to trust to trust the universe and Trust the unfor the process of unfolding yeah you have that essential trust you're going to be grab grabbing on whether that's meditation practice whether that's uh music or Aikido in any art you know Justin's wonderful medical practice and so on he continues I can tell just every talking with here listening to him every time you know he's deepening in his practice and you know you can feel it yeah, I can feel it yeah you can feel that he's been he's doing the work uh anyway so again just to go over again uh that there are different things that you like that assist you in this harmony game Okay so we've got breathing it throughout chanting uh certain move body movements uh meditating yeah so anything vibrational chanting vibrational anything vibrational um oh Sensei like fire and water as an example the uh as the fire and water at whatever level as they get more in harmony with each other there is Steam so he's like fire water steam okay, and because of my background I've always liked fire water Steve okay uh, a little bit esoteric for some people fire water steam what the hell uh but uh yeah it just represents two forces in the harmony between them is represented by the steam at a steam level there we are now we've got us a doorway yeah see when I was first playing with steam a fire water steam and I'd get to the steam I'd just hang out with the steam, it wasn't sharp enough at that time to go okay steam, and you fully experienced steam, but with the sense of now this is an opening to the next, this is a trade-in of everything to the next, dimension in the more totality of Who You Are You Are again did I say that right this doorway pattern thing because that's what I wanted to really kind of get across to tonight we've talked a lot about Harmony and balance we've done a lot of practices uh but again some people hit balance it's nice and they stop there I'm just saying if you've got the time the energy or just strong pull that no there's more then it's a doorway use it trade in whatever words you want to use there for the next dimension of Who You Are blah, blah I miss anything there talk to me from New Zealand um I was just going to say that I think that one of the elements that's, that has to be there for this all to happen is you've got to be curious and inquisitive and I don't know necessarily that everybody is that, that for a lot of people it's okay just to get so far no they're comfortable in their normal life don't bother me I don't want more I have to do have to do I ain't got time to meditate I got my bowling class tonight or Club yeah so yeah, yeah of course of course of course, and also wonder if maybe the Curiosity and inquisitiveness are maybe qualities of the with the warrior spirit um, yeah and Warrior Spirits Priestly Spirit the psychological Spirit yeah so yeah they each have their own you take on it's not just limited to one style we can't ask everybody to be a warrior, to do this so since they happen to be a warrior I happen to like the warrior, I happen to like the warrior line but that's you each have your own form okay, so I'm not asking you to be you know umpteen Don in Aikido that's you like music you like uh whatever social networking kind of thing and development uh beautiful, yeah so let's not limit people's all I'm trying to say did I miss anything in the in the basic Harmony patterns body movement chanting vibrational if you're a musician maybe uh, basic meditation with some kind of two beat sense there uh that would cover most of the main ones I don't miss any it's gonna say it's Chip, chip hi chip go any Harmony as a physical body sensation that's been something that has been showing for me okay by the way before you continue uh what you said body same must be doing something body what anything is swimming, okay and so I can feel when there's Harmony in the body it has a particular Sensation that um all of a sudden just starts showing that there's and that balance is there too but I think for me it comes with a with a is it Harmony as a physical sensation as a healing cool, yeah and then we'd say if you have the time in the pool and the interest can you go another dimension oh yeah that's I know the pleasant feeling of, the body being in harmony with itself at that level it's very nice right but what I'm trying to push tonight is now that's a doorway are you going to take advantage of the doorway do you want to take advantage of the doorway okay there's a there's a feeling of, connection with the space because the space is water and the body is water so there becomes a connection there too so it can lead to that that's cute see right there you're getting a good uh, say the body is the center and the water of the pool is this circle uh that they're starting to say hey we're in agreement in that sense that we're both water that's cute that's cute yeah uh, okay, I want to say something I, don't know if I, think I mentioned maybe a couple of years ago uh, oh sensei, was taken by this guy in his fishing Village who was uh underwater spear fisherman, and uh oh since I like to do go in the water and, go deep and anyway so he knows this guy from The Village you're in and this guy's very good with it and something about when the guy was in the water he'd look like a fish he moved like a fish he wasn't just a comfortable swimmer he had, maybe gone past that level to where even his exterior movements and stuff begin to look like a fish so could that be an example of one more inner level just, in a Side Story no big deal but yeah [Music] what if we do an old time simple practice but I, think, just for fun okay and uh you know do it standing yeah check my camera over here there it is okay there are two forces okay in this case simple oops we're on camera simple one a fourth that close up screw you and afford to throw it down true you okay settle open so purchase an idea and a fine, you got to start someplace but then as we settle in open energies flow up through maybe the beginning of a little bit of feeling about those forces not a continual knowing and get a better mental image of them uh it's more internal as soon as you can okay so there's idea there's feeling there's finer feeling there's sense feeling okay that's, where we're heading to whether we give you the time to hit that level just a sense of that one of those forces is masculine one of those Fortune is feminine I'll let your system you decide which is which okay for me historically masculine has been up, feminine down that's been me historically you're, you whichever, so in allowing this force that flows through touching the other one the other one responds down through um deeper, one of them is male one of them is male one of them is female, one is female one of them is male [Music], are we at that level yet or is it too soon opening so the energies that flow are at a better dimensional level they're finer and they go through and rebound the other one flows through now deeper easy more open a black world that you can say here listen fence feel or finer feeling this energy masculine and feminine and add this one feminine or masculine Brad can you tell yet which is it too early in the game can you tell yet which is a he in which it's a sheep I'm feeling down as more masculine enough is okay and if you play with this and give it a few extra minutes that would become clear especially as you easy settle feel finer feeling now you see everything talks so this energy that comes up says something about or two that other force, that other four response says something back they're dialoguing and you get to the level where you can hear not, physically with your ear uh sense feel Fear Experience what they're saying to each other okay I'm taking the approach that we're not at an harmonious level yet taking the approach to that the level I'm not playing this game uh they're still at odds a bit she's not sure about me and he thinks she's the baby yeah I'm at that level okay following that pattern what is one saying to the other and how does the other retort graduate conversation over their little angle with each other yeah right now I'm here well there I feel the down masculine is like a call and then the feminine is an answer and well what's your colleague what's he saying her what's she saying to him the he is saying to see I'm here and then she is there's a I'm feeling a sense of delay in a gap but that she is saying, um ready to receive it's like I they're still static but at the level I'm not right now but I feel there's a call and then there's okay I wanted it to be a little tighter so they're still laying in with each other but he's not playing he's, gone past that so we won't listen to him for now he, jumped past us well they're not talking to each other in fully so that's kind of scary yeah so he's saying I'm ready and she's saying I got something yeah but they haven't, only is that okay yeah it's the promise of but it's not the uh boldness of the experience of can we say it that way okay all right now, I'm getting a sense of he's saying I'm here and she's saying well so what and it's not quite yeah so after a while I think of it like the dating game at first I'm not sure about each other they're both kind of careful uh one may be more okay but the other one's hesitant something uh something not harmonious and as you hang more room binder sense of finer Dimension more rooms they start to work it out okay um and there should be a certain level where their relationship we could call a harmonious Center harmonious what word are we using balance that there's a certain level of where they're in more ink or in accord with each other and you can sort of stuffly feel itself feel it inner imagined feeling okay so again I ran it fast but just to get you to remember we did this practice we can remember how they were bitching at each other at first and how they begin to work it out and get more okay with each other Ah that's a movement of the he she Energies, getting more in harmony when they're in a Harmony uh there's that censured ballots we're calling it and that's a doorway if you've got the time and energy and interest to move into a much finer Dimension who are you at that next find the dimension okay always believe in Donna who are you just Wendy two forts that are not okay with each other as if they're parents and they've bred you the character when they're more in harmony feeling you the character because they're more non-rated character should be a bit better no or anything yeah anyway that's a practice we don't have time really to do it it's full length of time that we need but foreign so Justin that's all I was trying to say at the beginning when you're using your partner as a reference I said yeah that's great I also like this very personal that's a very personal practice okay it's just me with the two forces of me, okay, Yes I jumped ahead there a little bit sorry I don't think I uh, do again kind of short but then we get uh tell me about your conversation of he to she, to he anybody get to the point where they could hear the conversation um go far she was offering love and support and he was offering intelligence and strength it took a while to get there go back heavier tell me about the before they worked this out yeah I was just about to do that thank you okay you okay go she was offering and he was feeling I don't know about this I'm not sure I understand what you're offering I don't know if I want it maybe there's strings attached, etc, etc, uh so it was a big question mark on the nail side as far as what the email was offering and that caused some consternation on her part because her offering wasn't exactly yeah, yeah, yeah so that was the banana part yeah okay so when they come to terms continue Bob when they come to terms and they're whatever she's offering and whatever his relation back is a certain point there that we're using the word uh, the balance point okay, and not the balance point we could play different games at the balance point where you say okay your parents so if we look at them as parents for example your parents are more in accord you heard what they were offering each other now, they bred you the character who are you feel yourself experience yourself you so you could do it at that level okay before we use the doorway approach to a finer level you could establish uh you at you character at that level okay is that am I saying it right clearly yeah somebody anything out of out of this did you hear the conversation all right since it's Justin again I uh for me the, male component was a very active energetic let's go, component um and The Feminine was a, more form framework Logistics support oriented yeah okay back a little tighter for me what was their at first so, the, it's it, seemed like um he was excited to go on a picnic and very spontaneous and let's go it's so much fun let's have a picnic and she said whoa, whoa what about the gas in the car do you have the map you know let's make lunch first you know let's, make lunch first you know let's, uh let's um you know put some uh structure, but we're not ready to just head out the door yet yeah reservation, was uh was coming up I guess yeah okay, then we move on let's see uh they move on let's say they move on to some Harmony did you express that clear enough yet the harmony between them yeah uh and there if you were to check you the character with those as parents let's say feeling you ah character tell me about you it's the child born out of harmonious parents at this level tell me about you is a is a child that has a sense of balance when it comes to, working with both the flow and the form of a situation or the, framework and the, energy required there's a there's a balanced way that they come together and they agree they agree is much and we can't plan forever either happy medium yeah you know so a balance between the, energy and the, and the, framework of a situation both, and again for people now he, knows this he knows this I would want to double check myself the feeling the feeling the feeling of me character okay we're getting let's see mom is good at that and dad is good at that therefore it should be this it's fine it's fine but we got to be careful we're not just doing idea awareness all the time the experience the character that breathe that afflicts that's something oh the character his sense of what he can do and make sure we get a lot of that the experience of, see I'm always fighting against the awareness of and the awareness people unfortunately think they've got it all in fact that's another good way of looking at this the awareness people uh can expand through awareness uh and think they've got it all and they missed the, experiential they miss the experiential they miss the experiential okay and that's very critical that we get this fullness okay all right so in The Human Condition we have a preponderance uh for awareness and not anywhere near enough experience and that continues on through even finer Dimension so uh don't let up on it as you develop finer and finer, dimensionally uh keep checking on that experiential double check it because the awareness will be aware of the word experience and say oh yes I'm experiencing and I get the feeling that they're close but it's not the experience, okay that's where I bring up the dumb stories of getting close to the hot baths tub and you get close you feel the steam you feel the moisture you feel the heat, and you know about a hot bathtub you've got a lot of knowledge about it say oh I'm experiencing and I say no not in this way in this way you got to sort of immerse totally in the tummy feeling the Heat, okay and, doing what a chip was saying with swimming uh were the hotness of the tub and the Warmness of the body are like one thing okay yeah about that anyway somebody help say something intelligent here say something not so intelligent I don't care say something Sensei Teresa here hey Teresa so I have a question um in regards to when you're in that balance space and you feel that you are balanced and then as far as walking through that doorway are is that like a thought saying I'm walking through the doorway because I feel balanced or what does that okay it's not a thought okay I might have a thought before that oh this is a nice balanced place oh that's right there's a doorway here easy a sense feeling not physical feeling an inner sense interdimensional inner sense just, of moving out of the realm you're in into a finer Realm it's not just an idea we need more experience so this sense of how to say it better somebody we got a lot of smart people out there how would you say that better but I'm not saying well yet somebody Sean, here I, would say that you know sometimes you like you notice that there's a predisposition to uh a tendency and then you, break through and there's a uh an immersion into that the actual situation and that hold it there I like the word immersion, inner sense a finer Dimension sensing I can't really do a proper immersion with an idea I can have an idea of the person but I'm not immersing yes, completely submersed in the actual experience, um, that diagram ain't bad and then noticing that there's a there's a proclivity uh a tendency uh, uh, a history of something else and that's a that's you know that's being that's, you know that's being that's being real there's a an honesty Factor there's a uh um uh, what do you want to call it I mean like when you're when God forbid the day when you're not around to, like talk in my ear and say hey wake up you know this is different you know this is this is now and that's, the so like, noticing my own proclivities yeah noticing my own tendencies okay uh I like the one thing there you brought up uh where I'm the nag in the air hey wake up when I'm gone yeah what I'm hoping is that we open enough we settle enough and that we know the main pieces there and we open to them so yourself may say hey you're being you're being this and I'm self and I'm here and grow come on back to the more of me okay or it could be the energy the aliveness which we have to lay out on a Friday night class um uh the underlying energy Vitality I'll sense I like that word the original ALT key, okay, uh and that can be a spark uh where that will push in prod and move you around uh so to have the ability of listening within yourself for guidance would be nice yeah, Sensei um you um have shown me more than a few times the, urgency of nowness uh with uh, the, um abruptness that a martial art requires and that is um uh, essential to the martial arts the budo and it is um I feel your [Music], um, essential quality that I feel as a student, um very fortunate to have um witnessed or to have experienced yeah, I think I think urgency, is the main point I think the bread I, think it's a matter my, on things would be who did it it's urgent perfect easy settle there is a level where if it happens to be now it's not and that wasn't my best level easy seller another level easy, and that moves this moves so see it depends who did the urgency if you're doing the urgency then no man no if it comes from an inner finer and it's just an inner finer thing that's different, okay now, you have to have a sense of the inner sense of things as opposed to the outer sense of things anyway, uh but let's go back to somebody let's go back to uh a simple statement, uh to Teresa about inner sense, remember a question intersect somebody have a easy Farm Noah you're not going to bite the bait on that one yes it's a it's, the same pattern again, you stay present you stay open and they hold it there a moment I'm just jumping on words you can't say the same pattern to Teresa because this is her second show she had to memorize all the patterns or practice all the patterns so let's talk to Teresa if you stay open if you stay present and you have the interest as you were saying to move on that's enough and if you hold that place what's next will begin to show itself on its own terms it's not something you have to know in advance or decide what it might be it will show itself okay but I don't want them to hold at the balance point, you see because that's a problem already in a lot of cases well I'll wait for, God to tell me what to do or something you're an Inquirer you're a Seeker for finer, so can't you at least there say if there's more please show easy I'm trying to be here as best as I can easy settling show yourself I hear there's a next finder here easy are you there easy open listen feel sense so a little more activity than just most definitely you can do what you just said yeah or cutting it off yeah, the, danger isn't pre pre-determining what it might be oh yes the way you just said it you wouldn't do that yeah all I know is it's there and there is more and the more may show as more space the more may show as a better level character the more may show as a clearer shot on the design of creation how the forces work okay the or the self easy the eye eventually there is a self there, okay, but I know but I know using any one of those whichever feels comfortable for me at that time or whichever one I want to major in we could say uh that there is something and I settle open for it and uh it wants to show it's not hiding the finer of things seems like it sometimes like where the hell is God when you need them kind of thing you know that uh we're putting up the obstruction let's say easy letting go of everything and that that's their show at that that's there be present easy since finer sense finder anyway uh anyone on, Teresa's what do you do at the doorway question I believe is what she asked nobody's gonna jump on that dear God people I thought I had a semi-advanced group here group here okay so I'll try a little bit Bob thank you, um but what it takes me to is very early on working with you and you know we did some processing meditation and all that and my life got better I mean you know I was not constantly nagged by that chattering conscious mind and I remember at some point along the way you and I don't know how you said it but was that that's all well and good but and I suppose that's the hammock you know you get to that place and you think oh you know this is very cool I like what we're doing and I feel better in my life, uh but then you start talking about and you continually would say there's more you would a constant theme of yours there's, more or and what else and, um, I think we have to come up against our own uh tendency to just want to feel good and we get to that place of balance or Harmony but, the next thing is going to show itself it's that, portal that you're that you're suggesting, um, and I think we have to be able to separate, you know that immediate feeling which, is nice with that sense that okay and what's next that portal we're always standing at the doorway I don't think there's ever a time that we're not at the doorway to what's next and all we're saying is be proper at the doorway by using the harmony game whatever form you like Harmony you're gonna chant it sit it move it whatever ah, boom so your proper at the doorway yeah, and being ready and open to something more uh and that's the to me that's the portal is that it's almost like an attitude you're, saying okay yes and, and uh being, open to that yeah, and it just it's I think uh difficult uh foreign it's not thinking but there may be a thought that precedes here what should I do now okay that's a thought easy as we settle and open one pattern I use is thinking feeling finer feeling inner, sensing inner sensing, this inner world that that's where going for this inner world and being letting it do whatever for example it mixes up a finer level character you you're a calmer character you can move in such a way that you couldn't have moved before it just as an example uh your uh your self's Viewpoint what your philosophy what's your Viewpoint of Life at this level, and hopefully the eye doesn't jump in and take it over again it's a self sense I don't know how but I believe there's some hope in the world I hope I'm right we'll see but to level on that uh whatever, so we've got four main components that we can use in our settling opening uh to reference our presence in the next level uh but you can't just think about the next level there's a that's why I did the diagram thinking feeling finer feeling much finer feeling sense feeling sensing is a dialogue for this inner, inner realm don't know how to say it any, better uh you know another thing you know you, give us a lot of information I mean we, we're learn you know there's a lot of depth to what we're talking about and we have to hold that you know like for instance even the, thinking feeling sense feeling uh sensing that's information in a way yeah at that level yes I gave you information up here now it's up to you to experience that yeah, hold on to the information you kind of have to be really easy with that yeah but again it's a starting place yes now he said finer feeling okay let me I'm feeling now easy settle open finer feeling, and, there's just something going on it, feels like a finer feeling okay easy, agency settle open and again this is an inward journey and not out here it gets an inward Journey easy a finer, feeling hmm interesting at this level I don't move my arms my arms it's like you're being moved it's like it's like you're being moved it's like there's something happening they're floating them up kind of thing I'm starting to get some inner experience of something the words are people do the best you can uh let's see I'm gonna do a quick aside for a moment yeah forget it uh anything, anything, we're a quarter of already uh, Teresa are you still on or do you give up in disgust no, no I'm still here what, would you consider meditating what is meditation to you um well currently my practice is um, quiet emptying my mind focusing on breath, um and then depending on if I'm working on something like if it's a painting or something I might just see like if something surfaces and then go from there with it oh okay in that case I don't think teaching myself would call that meditation if you're settling in whatever to be more to do a better painting or yeah I'm not talking about like an intention like if I'm going to be painting and have an intention I'm going and breathing and clearing thought sometimes things get at a better level of artists could I say that yeah, and that's okay that's okay common sense if you're going to hit the golf ball settle and open get to a better level so the golf ball gets hit better yeah it's come that's daily common usage it'd be nice if every human knew that because they function better and they feel better and be better yes but it's not what, uh what US deep people are saying is meditation, we want to get out of that whole realm even into a finer level and then we'll see how the finer level does things but uh but to go a little more into the finer dimensional finer dimensional and if I just go into a calmer place where I can more calmly decide on what to paint or whatever or how to hit the golf ball or whatever yeah but we go more and more and more finer and finer and finer it could we distinguish it that way so what you did for your process is like yes now let's continue with my finer just for this inquiry sake can I say it that way just to see what's there at finer and finer see what shows there finer and finer, yeah, yeah so this last week um some girls and I we've been doing like this dance group and but it's been calling me more and more and more to do it, um but it's coming from within and it's but so when you were talking about balance that resonated with me because I'm so good at dancing but I feel like I could be better so that I was when you said that, really I could I was like okay well then maybe you're at that Gateway place that's good people uh what she's saying is her sense of the push she's getting from is an inner push that's cool okay it's an inner put it wasn't like uh your parents saying you should go to more dance classes or your best friend saying go to more dance classes and it's like nah I don't want to it's this inner push you're, feeling this desire so that's an inner push okay and I like to follow inner pushes uh because it's an aspect of me that wants to develop more so you think your dance skills are pretty good but your inner character inner self somebody your inner energy somebody in there is saying you'll get more now go back there's more for you here and we'll develop that aspect of you by going back to more involvement in dance so yeah is that did I say that right damn right damn the words so in that place though so is that something where I'm getting before or if I'm out because if we're out in the park dancing and then that's when I'm getting that feeling for like more, more and so like another dimensional level of dancing of dancing yeah I've laid that out as Bobby Robert nado, so Bobby has a trade-in for Robert and soon as possible Robert trades in for not go for not go not go trades in for the great Sensei yeah, uh so yeah it's just Satan using this form it's saying to you a mentor your next Dimension here this inner Dimension and it'll be a better dancer and then at that level uh you'll experience or learn things you'll experience things that are beneficial for you I don't know what they are it's your system you've, you've experienced okay yes thank you yes thank you so uh yeah basic people uh don't understand the push of things uh and in The Human Condition uh often the push is received as a negative oh I'm getting antsy oh this makes me nervous oh that's annoying me unless we hang and settle and open and say hey I played the say what game would you really say you didn't say annoy me would you really say easy would you really say it or what are you really trying to do I don't think you're trying to annoy me you have my attention here I am say what, are you presenting, what should I soak in what should I soak in what should I inhale so to speak yeah so even that first part where people are being pushed in some form either the eye pushes because you're being a cell uh an identity sorry you're being an identity and the aisle go come on Move Along come back to me art may be just the energy there's an underlying energy for everything all right and it'll push easy uh we'll do a Friday night and just highlight the energy things uh, so energy Advanced presentation and we'll, do that soon I've got it sort of roughly in my notes to follow up on I don't see your face right can I see your face are you there you are hi uh, file this one away because I'm wondering if a missing piece or a missing something for you is this inner aliveness this juiciness this Core Power let's call it this is human terms it's Core Power that if we don't have that enough or know how it works we could have a sense of things sort of a shadow outline of ourselves and a shadow outline of ourselves as a famous actress or whatever, but it's a sort of a shadow outline it's sort of hollow a bit and you kind of feel hollow yes I sort of believe it I sort of trust it but, but and you ain't got the guts for it so I'm thinking about uh, and I'll double check with the energy aspect but I'm thinking a lot of people don't really utilize this enough or know quite how it works or they stop short they get a little uh, what is it you do Pilates uh they get some, degree of core and I think that's it I've got cork uh hell that's just the beginning people or the Tai Chi Master whoa he's fancy he does things that are like whoa we're not finished there's more there's a, whole original of energy anyway so I want to do a whole Friday night on just the energy I just thought I'd give you a heads up on I'm wondering if you don't need a little more of that boom Oh since they might call it inner fire, okay we'll find whatever words you like that's different names I don't know just a feeling that you, could, you could use it, would make things easier because the shadow sense of ourselves uh what a I got a good vision of it you know uh, I, believe it I really feel that whatever, but, but, there's a little butt in there but uh sorry I don't know what to do or whatever, I think it's this energy part that we haven't clarified in enough, okay, anyway another Friday night for that we're, reaching the end already uh and anything to finish up here is, that sort of okay uh Army different forms of Harmony so in this case I'm just trying to show there's a center of the circle the pattern character to the situation he's in or this up and down high things real deep things we could also use that as you have the idea good now give me the experience they'll be equal to it so they're in harmony, and because of the harmony they'll be a character, there'll be a better level of self there'll be more sense of the space of things there'll be a better sense of the what's our word portal construct no contract I'm going for the four didn't you catch I was going for the photos uh bass character design of, the creation yeah uh okay you got one, last minute then I'm out of here anything one last minute an observation insight you want to vomit go ahead Cincy this is Lauren I, think that it's actually quite you know uh fascinating what you've done tonight because you've taken two giant themes that you've worked on through these lectures for each one of them for months the Center Circle dynamic you have there on the left and the awareness experience Dynamic and what you've said tonight is that, you can approach this if you like a center circle and you talk to us about well and some people are more Center and some people, are more Center and some people are more Circle and you should take you know follow your tendency but then try the other to get balance yes and you've also said well many people start with up in their head and they they're they have an idea about energy but that's not really the energy they have to experience it and as they open and settle, they'll experience it more and then they have a better idea of it and it goes round and round and builds on itself and what you're saying tonight is that either way either way either approach to this sense of balance yeah Harmony and let's say completeness that you know if you can take your circle and rotate it however many times you want to yeah people you've got your own Styles we just give you some main examples uh but whatever's comfortable for you that I don't know what to say it fits in with the construct design of creation okay certain Basics from very fine Tighter and Tighter and Tighter into heavier here we are and from heavier to finer, finer, that, beat is a part of the design a very important part of the design, that's why you could be pretty good and then be pushed into bitchier and bitchier where did that come from well that's the forces working until saying forces go the other way and they can help you settle and open and return back to the more of yourself so you learn to recognize be present properly in the force you beat the design of creation just simplify things well you've simplified things a lot tonight thank you so much great, I'm happy thank you Sensei and good night good night everyone take care thank you thank you everything the best to you and uh everyone's still out there Lauren thank you Mike

good evening Sensei good evening okay, good evening people last week's diagram ah, carried over from last week what the hell did we do last week let's take a moment remind me of last week would you somebody you think I'm kidding around I'm serious remind me what we did last week here fire in the belly good morning okay where we're saying each let's call it dimensional level of opening in the binder dimensional level that using fire in the belly that they that the character has more energy and more energy from their core or hata or whatever, whatever, okay and that the self basically has the same thing as is more self it's alive and can radiate the word is was that our dialogue last week yes oh good okay all right all right any carryover comments questions on that before I turn the page oops Turn the page for tonight anybody anything uh, a filled Booth I just saw your name uh the CAA is, is, dying to have some dues from certain Dojos okay uh anything for last week I have a question Sensei so enjoying this diagram you put your little stick figure inside the character Circle but you left self yeah well yeah well characters will continue with the kind of uh, uh a figure when we get finer and finer uh when I feel we're squared away enough to make an approach on the next big step the domain then we'll go into archetypes and they have bodies so to speak okay, so that's kind of a body, body sense with the character all along the way but they get finer some physical body of course physical body and an energy body and then whatever body and on and on okay so the, body sense seems to stay the, uh self is a little more uh what does those sense they call it in a more advanced levels not opaque transparency of self that's just phrasing uh it's more transparent okay so I couldn't design it it's transparent it's present it's experiencing what's going on but it's more transparently present okay if I if I stick in this glass a piece in this glass of discolored drink and stick a piece of glass into it in a certain way the glass is like the self it's there it's aware of the colors and all that stuff but it's transparent in its presence experience did that come out right Lauren yes sir and in this case the glass would be the situation uh I was cutting it down there a bit give me a second I don't know what to do with that right now uh just, pass it on forget it yeah, um yeah I don't know my mind is sort of set on situation as more kind of the human here and now here comes a situation because of the energies of that situation the center characters affected by that and hopefully the center characters equal to the energies of the situation and is in harmony therefore with the situation okay so yeah exactly thank you okay let's turn if there's nothing, more from last week anyway okay, easy the eye okay so we have this let's say Universal Character let's say and the universal self let's say okay but because of the vortex of creation it got Tighter and Tighter and Tighter okay it's kind of like everything got squeezed in okay and I'm a Bobby or I get squeezing more I'm weird Bobby okay and I, all right [Applause], so there we are in this Tighter and the eye is very strong because it's squeezing in thing okay are we okay so far squeezing in tighter dimensionally heavier dimensionally eye as we EC the eye easily I easy the eye take advantage of the more room that's there we call space I believe or earlier in the year uh in more space easy the eye and there's more space, so that the eye will come pass through this more and more and more opening uh and then eventually have a big enough clear enough easy the eye to where it's like, open enough like I'd like the word stage the stage is clear enough where the main pieces can have a turn if they so want to take a turn the finer of character may want to show that it's there and will Express itself dialogue itself or we're just staying with the two uh tonight uh or in that same space the self may want to say I'm self I'm the forever one or something uh okay so I'm easing the eye we're moving from this tighter squashed in easy, easy we're passing through this and getting to this much better Easy the eye kind of an open stage where you can choose or they'll take turns so one of them will say I want a stage and it'll be a better character I want to function better I want to be uh present myself better or whatever or it could be the self one wanting to express itself it could be the other two pieces I don't want to get into them tonight but again the uh, the workings the uh Welsh space is more alive so space again and uh the construct design, of creation may want to say hey I'm the design of creation this is how I work and it's important that you have a little experience with me okay so somebody will want to take Center Stage are we sort of okay with that so big green we're in an eye level we're going to easy the eye easy the eye more room, a bit deeper always helps more room deeper easy the eye easing the eye can we get to a good enough space of easy the eye where we can refer to either the more advanced character or the finer level of self that can show I don't know if I, can say it at the moment any better it did but I miss anybody here is something we'll stand in front around for a few minutes but before we do that is, that those pictures sort of do anything for you Sensei could I interrupt please and ask, questions to please the focus on the camera, Focus we're a little off focus, we're a little off focus sorry to interrupt what does that mean was I blurring what you're not sharing you're, is that the best you can do Brad yeah so far is that any better all right we'll, have to just proceed, your explanation is clear but your picture is a little blurry that's the state I'm in I'm in a blurry State here give me a few minutes uh, okay, nothing, yet, well since I wonder it's, maybe old, lessons but I'd like to hear it again when you say easy the eye the easy part of that verb what, do you mean by easy let go or the all the alternates let go let go or the all the alternates let go of whatever you're hanging on to it's this way and totally this way that would have been this way easy, when you're hanging on to it in that dark German fashion easy so there's a bit of letting go maybe a better in the letting go of clearing happening easy there's more room easy but what should I do no, no easy let's continue settling opening a sense of going deeper in this foreign okay it's sort of in the smaller form the eye thinks it's the boss in many cases it thinks it's everything okay are you trying to explain some of this stuff to a normal heavy human and he's I don't know if I can believe that, that's the eye locking in I don't know if I can believe that easy what are the possibilities or what's your sense of what they're trying to explain easy it's all that letting go and uh, not hanging on more room really a useful trick knowing there's more room the space trick okay so that lets go of its locked in fold and in using the more space more space we'll get to we'll pass through this we'll get to here where there's more space and again either the self may want to take Central stage or a much more advanced character will want to take Central stage is that sort of okay is it okay to think of the easy the eye is the eye getting out of the way of character and self yeah just now I'm just learning the words getting out of the way okay I'll get out of the way I don't see uh so it's probably right but I myself I just don't like get out of the way easy settle open don't get out of the way be here in this process here and now opening finer Dimensions deeper finer dimensions are inferred be present in it getting out of the way sounds like I'll get out of the way I don't see kind of thing is that is that okay yes now your sense of it may have been great but I have to act the wordings okay I'll get out of the way it is not doesn't do it for me and I don't think it does it for a lot of people they'll misunderstand it okay thank you sorry I'm so people on certain words but they potentially are meaningful okay we know our words will screw us up anyway but we do the best we can let's not use that word because a lot of people with that word interfere okay uh interfere no infer dot, dot uh let's try a different words not to have that inference kind of thing okay I have this is Amy I have a dumb question, um, yes Amy Florida Amy Florida, Amy yeah you know okay so you're saying that you know more space finer character um I don't want to start my video thank you, um I don't want to start my video thank you okay no problem um, um okay but then there are these people who take tons of space but they're in a smaller character you know they own the room they pushy they're in their ego blah, all right okay first Amy when we say space we're not talking about a bigger living room and then uh, I'm, out into my street uh and I'm approaching downtown where I live San Mateo uh it's an inner sense of space an inner sense of space which may show in your radiation in your presence but it's not necessarily a pushy space all you people get out of here because I need more space it's about that type of space it's an interior sensing space that's there does that help um yeah a little bit you know I think about some of the politicians who um don't go there don't go there I ain't going there don't go there okay yeah anyway it's not the outer pushing get out of my way I'm here you know Bob uh talking about being here they may move out of your way just cuz whatever but it's not because you're pushing them okay anyway uh, Steve yes yeah what you remind me of is you know I we spoke during the week about when I try to explain some of this to Marilyn and you know it's, it's very difficult for her to absorb it and it's because her eye is getting the eye that wants to understand the, intellectual part the making sense of things and I find that it's, easier when you well easy the eye you loosen it and don't try and, grab on tightly to what, you're saying specifically but in general when we talk about this stuff when we easy listen and absorb it with not just our here but with our more relaxed lucky listen to music you let it wash over you so to speak okay all right so yeah if they have a type I and you try to get them to be aware of something or uh Grom on this something that you think is interesting for them uh but in that tight space they sometimes can't I can't take anymore honey shut up anything why okay I don't do it that way now that's what she's saying back to you oh okay yeah, yeah easy the eye you see the eye then everything starts to happen a little more awareness a little broader a little more ability to absorb a bit better easy, all along the way easy okay yeah the system will get it even if I don't get all the details you know I, will receive it from another place that, will understand better hopefully yeah, how many times I can't count the amount of time oh you said something 20 years ago which today made sense to me okay I was just looking over some of my old Sensei notes 10 years ago laying something out for me and it's like oh wow I could just see it so much clearer, it's like where the hell was I 10 years ago that is I had some clarity with it but not the degree I have today and that's been 10 years and I've been hacking at this stuff every day for 10 years, clicked today was a oh wow he really laid it out pretty good wow uh so the level I was at couldn't absorb everything he was saying I'm at a better level oh, he's saying a lot yeah so my absorption understanding experiential capability is better now who's that similar to what we're talking about, yeah, I have a question Sensei that's okay it's dusty yeah I like everything you're saying and wondering about the, small eye, like a lowercase i instead of a capital I like why you stop I had a big hassle would cut you over how to draw an eye she wanted to do a what I call a number one she called an eye and I said I don't know it looks like number one to me and she said no, no anyway so she chose that one because we were hassling over how to how to write I so don't you continue well I was wondering like it to me I thought you was there because like you can because sometimes you can get into that space I guess where you feel the self or the character and then all of a sudden like the eyes presence and the ease of the eye is like unlike this capital I right it's big and you got to feel strong or whatever it is like easy guys so slow down, and be like the lowercase i okay if that tickles you fine I'm not going to lay that out uppercase lowercase I, ain't going there but if that makes you happy does, have fun over there that's good I like the circles easy the eye hush, hush uh the eye can tend to be very uh pinball machinish easy hush quiet down that's just a little Prelude tricks to having the eye utilize the more room and open up stop being this and start being this show that a better character or a better self or any of the other pieces but let's stick with just character itself tonight I want to try to clarify it, again a little bit with this uh because it was brought up last week by uh what, is he on tonight uh last week character himself Ian no anybody remember something I can last week no, one remembers was one of your dedicated students sensei anyway so this question comes up a lot I can't tell the difference between character and self but one thing I'm trying to do here by getting more room and taking them individually so they don't smudge too early and you get a little confused giving more room where there's an open stage and sometimes character will want to take that stage and say I'm not Bobby I am Nado or I'm not Nado I am Sensei plus whatever okay or the self may want to take that Open Stage space and present itself and explain itself more about itself at that level okay we can't get this to happen when there's a tight eye it's hard to distinguish high and self because it's, too scrunched in so that's why people have trouble so this is a question we hear all the time, okay, from people I can't tell the difference well no for squashing kind of tight it's damn hard as we ease the eye open take advantage of the space it gets clearer and one of those will want to take a turn and present itself okay, you brought that up uh see it was it was William Robertson yeah Liam is this Liam on tonight he is okay Liam will try to get to clarifying the character as opposed to the self in a few minutes uh but Steve you brought that up a week or two ago uh where you were sitting and open whatever, and you wanted to work on character or something and suddenly self was there saying no I want to talk today and express myself is that not what you said could you say it better for me don't just nod say something muted my, keyboard was not responding properly anyway yes that, was exactly what I was saying is you know I have that agenda that I wanted to, work uh I don't may have been space or, character and self was what was showing and, it's uh yeah it's really allowing the system to, inform you instead of you, know trying to control it yeah you can start with an idea but if you're not open that, can screw you up uh I had a couple of sessions where I was really nothing was going on and I realized what was trying to show what's it what I wanted to do in that City, and I realized that and then I started being more open with, it more like I'll just make room all settle down I'll clear the deck so to speak hello anyone want to show here which aspect would like a turn any one of you are invited kind of thing and then after a while it's clear which one is taken Central stage as you hang out with them uh they you recognize them really quick after a bit he's like oh, that's character oh okay cool allow character Express itself at that level to uh facilitate your character being um let's do a standing practice burn a minute or two okay yeah, uh okay is that is that clear enough we can see you thank you okay searches are simple, okay so let's say hi okay easy the eye right away it's, panicking a little bit but where are we going what are we going to do easy meanings but I want to know where we're going I want to know what we're going to do communities and it encourage us that language, and at first an opening that there's a little more room here to get you infer a type of letting go easy, kind of like whatever I was hanging on to I'm starting to let go of a bit even using the eye music video am I there yet you see there is again easy the eye exactly take advantage of the more room more room I don't mean more room and I'm into the city of San Mateo and it's an internal dimensional remember thinking feeling finer feeling eventually sensing inner sensing [Music] the eye the eye in my room easy I would not go for anything particular now I don't feel the room up with something it's too soon easy the eye and I like spaciousness and I would like just to have it be clear be clear I call that a stage or clear the depth or the decks are clear easy give me all right you'll feel a little over in checking this out what's going to happen on stage please in the eye in first settling opening into the more room deeper, into the more room now I'm checking to see how much I'm thinking about more room and how much there's a defense experience of more room, English, that is your world is in the eye in my world English [Music] and again you have to find your style keep it simple you know either be more of a character that wants to show or more of a self that wants to show so if the easy bi said well who am I now again the character May kick in with it with it s character things or the self May kick in with its sense of itself okay short, but something, so easy the eye take advantage of the more room or space that's there of course it's internal finer dimensions so effective Florida Amy's question when I have more internal room that may sort of manifest here or at work I walk into a party and I stand bigly not pushy I'm not doing this overtly but because I have this inner presence of more room okay so the little people could look kind of big, and you're surprised when you get to know them how small they are because there's a sense of bigness now I'm big and I'm gonna put you over it's not extrinsic it's internal and it may manifest outward okay but that helps Amy Andy uh where the hell are we people did you get anything out of that short practice of easy the eye so send to more room we left it open and as you practice and play then be prepared either because you call it up it up or because you're saying whoever wants a turn that one of the major four will take the center stage we want to stay with the first two here character and self, character itself again are us people have trouble with them because everything overlays all the big pieces overlay okay uh but character itself are really buddies could I say self and character, and self uh I don't know if they're any closer than all the others a certain way but they tend to Buddy up really well and that's why people have trouble in a tighter space of distinguishing them because they're sort of overlaying in a sort of boat there boat there as you make more room and they have the full stage then they can take turns after you get the sense of how they take turns then we can move into a more advanced level where we naturally let them or we sense them as overlaying that's what I tried to do when we were talking some months back about that energy using healing energy, using healing energy that if the body is a little defunctive energy uh I say okay but let's check the self and when the self is present and I wanted to align the self to the body so we have a real hair okay so the body is here and itself is spiritual it's up there floating around in that cloud I want to do it here now everything here and now here and now okay find your Dimensions Here and Now okay that the globe the energy the energy that the self has being present overlaying underlaying with the character the glow of its energies can help facilitate the energies of the character okay character has its own energies but when you're sort of down you may not notice them as much but when the selfless its glow is present it can spark the energies of the character so you get the glow of the self and the glow of the character start to be more and more and more okay oh Sensei for example had a hell of a presence glow you knew he was in town okay the whole place would harm when he was in town when he left town the hum in the dojo slowly decrease just his presence being he would hump he didn't and I'll, make noise so you know I'm here I'm humming you didn't have to do that it was just there, was there was okay so inner, that may manifest outward, okay, anyway try to distinguish self and character uh characters I don't know he she who functions, okay let's use that let's try that issue of functions uh I can run faster uh I can carry more weight or whatever, okay character now, has a different flavor about itself yeah, and as you're making enough room and practice the game of living and take Center Stage they will Express themselves and if you're it's also experiencing you're experiencing them and, their job they're major there we go they're major there we go they're major they're major will get much clearer to you because you're having that experience that they're having with themselves, okay, so your play character will be very distinct in self, very distinct from character, all right your liveness of space very distinct from the other two and the, uh design of Creation The Center Circle or the vortex that activity that's definitely its own activity okay now they're all in relationship uh so they'll probably all want turns eventually, uh that's where we brought it up to introduce you that there are four main pieces and we sort of should have a sense some experience with them before we really take a much more giant step and move on and that's what we call the Manifest Universe to The Domain okay sort of a kind of a giant step okay, ah did I confuse you in here you see the eye get more space so that the character or the self has more room to show Express itself to be more present period boom yes uh Lauren is uh in other lectures you have said things like the character reacts to the situation that's presented okay you're going back to there again so I'm not sure if I want to dialogue there but go ahead it's okay I just want to say yeah and therefore this the character changes according to what it needs to be and it can be refined in a step-by-step manner travel vehicles and things like that but that the self is a more immutable unchanging distinct thing have I expressed that okay yeah yes but let's yeah let's, not make your first sense of the self as if it's totally fantastic God given everything uh there are I don't know how to say degree some cells are like feel like they're newbies here and they don't have a hell of a lot of past history experience uh some no quite how that works but they feel like newbies or their selves that really have it um exercise themselves as self to realize the more of themselves uh so we've got to be careful because we say self I don't want to say oh and he's totally perfect uh I like to work the continuing sort of degrees of self I don't know if I said that well go ahead help me here I just want you to keep going maybe you gotta spark me about that we'll go all over the place I also said that, this, I think someone asked last week or the week before well Sensei what is self and you said self itself is aware of itself and don't ask me to explain it that we each have to just talk it's self can experience itself that's all you have to know now you go they go and practice let's talk about that some more I'm Gonna Fill my head with more I was like yeah what are you going to do with it there's no experience going on aware of itself it experiences itself as self it's its own Unity people call it the soul the original one or something well maybe not anyway I had probably different names different cultures dumb games I used to play let me go I might have mentioned some before but let's go over them again a property at the stage I began to realize there was a difference between character development and self and I wanted to get a better shot on self so what I used to do was uh in a certain way kill the character one of my games was uh if acid were being poured over this character body and because it a wholeness of acid the body is totally disappeared okay what's here or who's here is there something here and that facilitated a letting go of the character and that was one of my dumb games okay, somebody said well what's the difference between a character in the South poor acid on yourself I would clay very clay very experientially sort of I'd really get involved mentally imaginary but involved, mentally imaginary but involved I cut my wrist in my apartment in Tokyo and I would bleed to death and I was as I was bleeding to death thinking about I got laundry to pick up tomorrow and what about Han what about that day you're dying and I'd continue to die to die okay so there were no concerns of Bobby in his world okay what was left self would show so I got pretty clear on who on a character as opposed to a self a whole different flavor a whole different, flavor a whole different sense of those and there's probably other games like that they're kind of dumb but fun I don't know if that helped any here you're on Lauren well I think what you're saying is that even if the character dies self remains and character will shift to another dimension of character you'll be a an astral being character or whatever but that self will still say I'm kind of Bob what, mine said to me once was uh when it was first appearing and there's a sense of who are you kind of saying uh or just, dialoguing itself uh and inferred Bobby's come and go, but I'm always here I'm more constant now Bobby's may come and go but Bobby's after they pass over will realize they're in a better Dimension and they'll become an astro body could we say okay, uh but still that sense of the self as being, self is always stealth, and, there is a more original of self a fuller of self okay so I like to also progress with self I don't want to think self once I once I got a vague sense or vague experience of itself say that's it and he's totally everything and not quite yet, so the more original of self something like that to, help carry me back to the original Self okay, just to just register ah you following me this Lauren yes I am I am oh good well I wanted to it reminded me your sense your discussion of space reminded me of standing in a absolutely packed subway car in Japan and everybody was extremely was completely calm and look you know thinking or looking at a book or whatever they were doing they didn't feel like their private space was, violated even though we were just pressed one against another their inner sense of their own space was so strong you know and you know you've described how we have to look for more Inner Space and I think that was actually a kind of you know to me it was a good example yeah, so the example I bring up Steve you remember this early days of me going down south uh we were using the same living room uh some lady whose name Swiss Army now or she had a good sized house and were using her living room she was a good sized living room at the same time we had a pretty good pretty good sized group there and we met what is it once a month for some years and, after about a year or so of the same amount of people being in this room somebody finally said hey it's a little crowded same amount of people in the same room but he hadn't noticed it before because probably what we were doing was a lot of internal uh presence kind of thing so even though it may have been crowded there was so much internal experience going on he didn't notice it was crowded sounded like you're Japanese in the subway kind of thing yeah anyway I found that humorous at the time uh okay uh so I think of character as the one that sort of functions and self is I don't know what the sense of things the philosophy of things uh, they have different flavors a galactic word flavor the flavor of each of the main components is a bit different okay so as you make a little room and, character or self-take Central stage and then you try the other one it's turned after a bit maybe the next day maybe the same day maybe the next day maybe the next week next week how it shows choose how it shows to you uh, as you play and experience what they're experiencing could I say then the distinction gets very clear to you okay if Katya walks into the room I don't say oh are you Brad that's his question Brad's Brad they're very clear to me okay so, these become clear to you too if you hang out give them room so they can really show and experience what they're experiencing be present while they're expressing themselves people can't say it too much better so easy bi to get to more room and in the more room either this or on a center stage or that'll want a center stage and could be three or four uh that's why colors one two it could be a couple other components but let's not worry about those right now uh because it comes up so often in questions but I can't tell the difference between a character in the South okay do that do that practice sit with it hang out where are we did I lose you too bad anybody hi everybody this is this is Justin I just uh wanted to share my experiences with this exercise that we went through together and some of the things that you Sensei and Lauren are talking about resonated quite strongly with me in that as we um yeah easy the eye and allow for more room the sense of identity eye seems to be one of not having to work so hard and there's a sense of uh you know peace clear calm that comes with it then I notice a character is the, one who's standing fully stand fully stand more fully is the character portion and then the self would be a, constant like you said uh the I am here now without that the sense of function per se there's the standing functioning one in space and then there's the constant the internal sense of the me I guess that's just yeah let me jump in for a second please could I say when the physical says I'm here now there's a certain flavor to it is when self says I'm here now it doesn't have that flavor to it it's a different tonality a different sense a different flavor to hear God yes yeah without the sense of uh of having to work at it like a, character standing is standing and there's a job there there's a job there a situation if you will the self doesn't seem to be involved like that on that level yeah not at that level I've got to move I've got to react I've got to this yeah not at that level yeah it might be there in the supportive underlying background can we say uh if it's a life and death situation it's not really time for you to go it might help intercede and put more energy into the situation the character and some, miraculous thing happens okay, but let's not straight too far into that stuff, anyway, yeah I said so you did talk last week about how, when you talked about alignment of character and self yeah again the overlay factor and those two are important to Overlay I, really came clear uh working with Susan on uh healing okay uh that too many sells for like hovering selves or standing off to the side selves hell I bumped into a couple of cells that were really way up there and off into a cave uh this faint line of connection but they weren't really fear okay and we found a lot of cells weren't aware they should be in alignment with their character okay we found some misunderstandings some self said well if I align to the character I'm going to be locked into that body it's like no, you're a self you can be present but not feel locked in so they misunderstood how it worked so we have to instruct a bit at that level, uh and start cells how to be better selves in alignment with the body and using that, time for more healing the aliveness or Alive glow of the self everything has energy right a live glow of the self could help facilitate because it glows aligned with the body it goes to and through the body helps the body has its own juiciness uh but helps to pick it up so it's like a double beat Big Bang so you get more okay and I think we kind of cover that talking about uh Core Power and foul tracking that back just with an energy sense ah did I say anything properly uh Florida Amy you on still she fall asleep I mean there are you here years ago you said I don't remember Wayne but I, happened to pick up some old notes and saw that notation uh you're much clearer on character itself now than you were some years back I hope yes absolutely okay keep it simple how do you distinguish character present, as opposed to self presence now that you're more open and present and allowing yes go ahead yeah, um, one thing I would say is um itself is impersonal in some way some personal and it's I experience it as [Music], um, huge just really huge and having its own um, and it's very calm and it's um it has almost like it's the rate the rate it radiates um the way I'm picking it up is it's not like it's almost like a mandala or something it has like a it has like a h, structure, in some way um not to confuse it with the uh structure uh, what's the other word design of creation right but within itself, yeah, yeah, yeah and um character, it's more personal it speaks to me I guess they both speak in qualities but for me character speaks more in qualities um I don't know what to say um, anyway yes as you continue to play people they're very distinct okay very distinct, um now as we easy and easy and easy and, open up more uh we're also moving into finer inner dimensional space and there's more juice there's more aliveness and more energy whatever word you want to use there uh and so and so be alert that because there's more energy it could push the eye that's there into a tighter eye uh again so hopefully you recognize a push but um see some people develop okay say, they get a better character and a better self and then sometimes don't think it potentially egotistical um their spiritual egotists for example or whatever form they're being ego that they suddenly get more ego where the hell did that come from uh and they're doing a good job of opening up but and not knowing that there is really a self clearly uh I, and I open and I'm functioning very well and I'm being noted by others yes, yes and because there's more energy they can really start to overdo that I call it the I can do syndrome uh anyway just file that away that there is more energy that's so noted so you don't get pushed back into it tighter when you've already opened to a certain degree uh don't screw that up by getting Tighter and whatever I hope I said that clear enough you can't go wrong uh I'm double checking with easy the eye he's a DI uh, after a bit huh whatever go ahead um the one thing I wanted to add was um that made the big difference which I was telling you on the phone is before I, wasn't aligning my perceptions my energy, um, my, two self two self it wasn't even in, the picture you know before these Zoom calls really um now there's more of an alignment in a relationship so they're like downloads of the self that come through um it's uh that's where that's where um passion of life is coming through in a different way um it's not it's just this it's this it's this Integrity that is um, beyond anything that I experienced in the past does that make sense yeah I just catch the first part what what's you're talking about alignment or something yeah it's in a lot it's, an alignment how do we aligning, before, before, Amy wasn't even considering or having a relationship with the Shelf it might have been there but I wasn't having a relationship with it right now my now my energy my perceptions my meeting my experience [Music], my intent is aligned to the self so that brings me that creates a stronger relationship it brings downloads in from the self the more it's like any training the more often you open to it the faster it gets and the Fuller it gets, you you've made it it's like a word's a good connection I sort of don't like that because it means this to that uh but it's certainly a good connection as I as I tie-dye easy let go whatever and, acknowledge to say self and, and, acknowledge to say self and, self starts to be there showing drawings at whatever level uh then the next time should be a bit easier potentially and the next month should be much easier you made a good oh you've opened up that path I don't know the words right, here but, yeah should be so it's like in some way like any kind of training you know if you run the uh around the block the next time you run around the block which should be a little bit easier and, the tenth time you run around the block could even be easier potentially you know it's just basic kind of kind of basic, uh anyway, thank you Amy oh okay people where the hell are we say something tell me you're confused tell me you're confused tell me you're pitching something say something foreign Bob here hey Bob there what you've outlined is a really terrific process and one that is doable and that is easy with the eye allow some more space and then whether it's a character self or in other cases one of the other big four is going to show up and has a chance to develop and you can repeat the process as many times as you want yeah it sounds like a uh, I mean it's profound it's profound partly because it's so doable and in a certain way I think you're bringing up the potential simplicity, yes here I am and it doesn't seem so simple easy ah ecbi Mom's room yeah I don't know more space dot, dot, dot and something is there being present with you with you there's some certain way yeah, what you're saying yeah you can it's a great get there yeah, uh that's exactly here let you get there more open it clarifies some more it adds to itself so to speak wants to show you the more of things yeah which is basic as you just said it's based on a very simple principle of training which is the more you do it the better you get and the easier it is yeah I think you learned a couple of tricks like because you say I want character I want a major in character could be one day it's somebody else says no I wanted her and there's something else there so little tricks like that you, you catch on too let me see uh thank you Bob appreciate it and you could probably run this pattern some other way that's something to do more advanced you you're getting a better sense of the self uh for example a practice might be okay uh the basics and you're trying to finder that and self, and a sense of self and it's glow let's say it's aliveness and, then you can just line that up to body character so self lining up the body character kind of with a sense of how does cells present with the character how does that help what goes on and we'll begin to show you certain things like the energy one that uh mentioning the glow of the self will mention how it improves the glow of the character okay kind of thing and other stuff I mean it's an endless possibilities of how a self better aligned with and present with its character can facilitate the character I probably haven't already that's four percent whatever of the possibilities there so that's your job if you're interested you set up that game, okay do the basics get to a bigger space finder space self hang out with self and then align self with character and see, can ask can ask not those says that your presence with character helps could you show me how it helps, inquire, experiment play you can't just uh get more information if you don't play it's very important to play okay since I use these words with me which will bring up when we uh and more clearly a major in domain okay so coming up soon uh, it's a good Library a lot of good information and you need a certain amount of information so a lot of what I do is throughout information okay then it is also a laboratory where you sort of play with things how does a self line up to the character how does that improve uh, how does the uh workings of creation the design of creation how does that fit in and does that fit in with the character it's a laboratory you're funning around trying different stuff the third one the gymnasium is very important well since they say also those first two could be a tendency to go more mental aware but when you have a gymnasium that's part of this uh then it's the actual more presence experience of these things okay so the idea the laboratory foot around a bit and the actual more experienced present boom something, like that we'll come around again on that when and if we get into that a more clear shot on domain, but not tonight oh man help me here I'm pooping out what you got where are we what's not clear what is and say it's Justin again I, I, I, love how you're reminding us always to stay with the, the actual experiential component of what's Happening Here and I know without going into the realm hopefully it's smudging the things that we practiced in the last several lessons that you've guided us through, have highlighted the fact that these big four complement and support each other yeah, and so as we did today eventually an original unit of creation they're all part and parcel so there's a, relationship uh and I think you said uh, they're also trying to help each other to support and balance with each other yes, yes yeah and why I brought up and introduced there was four is uh to have a sense of for some, experience with the four then we'll facilitate us moving into this bigger leap into what we call the domain have a sense of the four and then the laboratory how the four work together and the clarity more of the four and stuff like that, we'll need if we want to proceed past that level divine country but certainly don't be asking about Divine country because I know what you're going to do you're going to oh yeah I can think Divine I'm aware of some perfect glorious whatever and, he's going to get there on that I'm sorry I wish it was that easy let me think about it I'm there it is fat but it's not that fast it's easy but it's not that easy uh this experience because half of the creation is a major of experience and aware, and experience if you could just do it on awareness cool but you really can't you can go finer and your awareness will increase but you're going to get spun eventually sorry you need them both aware and experience experiencing I am aware need to both okay and the reason I keep pushing on that is because historically since day one I guess there's uh by the souls the beings whatever you want to call them uh started to major in aware of and we're light on experience okay and so that tendency has continued uh unfortunately for example said you know I could have taught just this awareness spirituality and been more famous had a bigger following but he said there's a lot of guys doing that you know talking about spiritual finer dimensions he realized they weren't experiencing enough, so this body development and this art of Aikido was trying to force people to assist people in more experience so they'd realize oh it's that and this and this and that they so he didn't take an easy Road the easier Road would have been to expound on the beauties of God and the Heavenly whatever's uh that would have been an easier form because it's sort of easier to go find or aware that away other people have noted it other Arts whatever have noted it uh Noah wasn't there something in yogananda's lineage where one of their Superior teachers and upper Fest teachers said something to the meditating students in, India I think it's better you guys play football no you're not aware of that or anything it doesn't ring any business doesn't come to mind at the moment and say sorry anyway I thought that was kind of cute you meditate but you're not experiencing a lie better you played on football I think it was alluding to okay yeah, our teachers should be jumping in now saying oh yeah I see plenty of those meditators do that Deja where are you when I need you isn't it a shame when somebody in their awareness starts to develop their awareness Factor and, somehow too many of them are don't function well what happens is it's a it's a it's a stopping point it, people will get into uh meditation reach a certain place and uh get too comfortable with it and stop right there I think we've all talked about that you know I've talked about that Noah and I've talked about that for sure and along with Lauren and Elaine and, moon we've all we've all kind of run, the course on that um yeah of course you, get into it um and at a certain place it you just you know you stop unless you're unless you have more of that inner fire that you've been talking about the last couple of sessions drawing you drawing you calling you and really that deeper listening I think Steve was, uh was mentioning that a sense of deeper listening and it's uh so it's so very important that we have that kind of quality and I the I think the beauty of the training that you're offering now and also in its relationship to aikido gives us that embodiment that you were talking about with the with yogananda's uh, um teacher mentioning to the meditators yeah you know you, guys you guys are he, didn't say it like this but he could have said yeah you guys are in your hands come on yeah that Justin was talking about that too yeah, yeah and the important thing then in that is to is to kind of mind that calling and uh and listen deeper and what Justin was, talking about going more for the experiential and it doesn't always show up as cognitive knowledge who else was talking about that someone else is mentioning that earlier um Steve maybe but it's um it doesn't mean that it's going to always be devoid of those kinds of elements of, quote unquote understanding but sometimes you just have to trust the universe and let go, you might even say easy the eye [Laughter] thank you Sensei I should be with you tonight into and uh and to listen to this because the, subject is, as uh as Noah was saying it's um it has an amazing potential for Simplicity but it's kind of tough too because we're the I mean itself that tight eye can't quite always grasp the larger picture and appreciate the spaciousness that internal spaciousness that internal spaciousness that you were referencing earlier so, knock another Sensei um, and he said foreign either I told you it was simple but I didn't say it was easy [Music] it's really easy but you have to catch on to it and it's trying to catch on to it together all these trials or tribulations and misunderstandings and stuff so once we start to get a little more clear with this we like to sort of throw it out there so that your trip is a bit easier you know I've tried to give you a lot of heads up like I did with this as you uh settle and open and the character self whatever Ensemble starts to be there better and you potentially start to get kind of hey this is me he goes Hector the eye ego starts to be there uh and based on you went a bit more open so there's more energies and that might be what pushed you into back into not it's the original tie-dye but and I I'm good I can do I can do with the sense that you can but I can do kind of thing uh so I try to give you a heads up on, stuff make it easier but you got to do it you got to play Hey I think we're just eight of our time here, uh did we sort of cover anything properly sorta I hope I hope a last question since a teacher just threw off uh, uh you know trust the universe and let go, all right and what if the eye doesn't want to trust the universe that's too big is it enough oh yeah no, no, no you cannot go from this to the great original Perfection of creation it's too big it's too big I, kind of would love to you don't want to eat it more time but it's kind of like I said The more original let's say it's kind of like a sum, and you know what's going to happen if I approach the infected somebody tried that who's that he carries hey how about that I remember hey first I don't have to refer to Noah it carries anyway as you get drunk so the sun is like burnout time so if the more originals like the sun you got to get used to how this works daddy did you say letting more warmth sunlight beat through they get comfortable you can't just go from here to the being in the sun I've arrived I'm, the human God it ain't gonna work so if that's what you're talking about hell no, and so is it would you think about trusting the system or trusting the path or trusting the teacher step at a time Trust, God, yeah see I sort of trusted yeah it's probably because enough people mentioned it who have been there uh oh sensei's been there now uh it's really beautiful or great or harmonious or loving or whatever okay I, believe that now what am I going to do now what's for me now and I trust in my own system is going to unfold, based on nado's Style based on my original intent in creation uh I'm gonna garble up words here enough for tonight thank you so much Sensei yeah okay all right, thank you did you get anything out of this, thank you for pushing us I, don't know yeah all right everybody how many people would agree that those Sensei never pushes he throws he doesn't push have a good night Sensei thank you everyone yeah thank you very much have a good weekend bye

## Harmonizing Character and Situation as Two Fields of Energy

**Date:** Unknown date  
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHc4_bcvdAE

okay all right this is uh from last week if you remember if you were here um what we cover last week any comments on last week before we move into this week whatever we covered last week yeah oh no class last week the week before that goes way back that's why I don't remember it so long ago anything on the last time you were here tonight will be a bit of a continuation I believe of this layout of different diagram coming up uh but we're talking about the character and the situation the other way situation and character [Music], um okay no comments on that let's let me explain this uh just some of the same as last week uh the sense of energy is going out and Energy's coming back so again we're uh I presented that as the characters energies to his situation the situation energies back to the character and that's all, that fancy arrows are one field of energy and it's responding field of energy okay and we're at this level calling it the character and the situation, and character, [Music], um get into what that color is about after a little bit as we get Harmony, more than Harmony a blended Harmony between these two forces um a blended Harmony between these two forces, experientially so not just the idea that's a starting place this is a starting place oh look at that picture what's it mean then we begin to set up open we're gonna sort of get a rough feeling for it we settle open or get a finer feeling for it finer feeling to experiential feeling actual experience we start with an idea a presentation a diagram, yeah, and to understand that in a certain amount yeah okay uh a Sensei would for me refer to that as a like a library certain amount of information then the next phase is the laboratory it's running around with this stuff running around with the beats okay then more fully experientially referred to as like a gymnasium where it's a full experience okay so a library a laboratory and a gymnasium and I, kind of like that the way you use that with me with me that make any sense to anybody yeah, um Library and sure okay uh unified field is a phrase moon like so I thought I'd burrow it tonight and give it a shot uh the harmony blending mix of those two horses okay fields of energy we call that a unified field I, believe right so the work struck me today when I was talking to him so I borrowed it unified field okay the army the Blended Harmony, and then the idea of it the feeling that she can do easy finer feeling finer feeling, fencing experience finer sensing experience okay where the hell are we roughly is that sort of okay where or are you with that that's nice well said see it the title tonight was uh harmonizing character and situation as two fields of energy, okay we need a good starting place okay so I'm going to present this as at that unified field or harmonious blend of the two as being a good starting place a good doorway okay, and roughly we could call that the character, and then when it's their position right proper right the experience of it then continuing into more original another word that I'll Sensei throughout meat I really like more and more, original in a certain way we're not going for the next finder and next finder and next finder we're saying yeah, yeah I practice with some of those Bobby Robert Nado one by two by three by four by five to the 18 by yes, yes but now let's I call it cut to the chase let's go for more original okay so as you get this lineup this harmony of character and situation, and character experiential where they're blending harmonizing this UniFi unified field okay, then if we hit a pretty good level the sense of a self and that's what that color is it just represents underneath all of this is a self okay so we get a good character a full character situation and character I'm calling a full character and more original the self that's there can begin to show so that unified field Harmony blend is a doorway to the next underlying piece where the self can show okay I said a lot did you catch anything I said that I confuse you with anything word might drink go there it is ah Sensei above here hey Bob there the thing that really stuck with me in terms of what you just said is that the work with the character uh is good but it has a limited lifespan in the sense that you get a good character going and then if you try to fine tune it that could go on practically forever and you would miss the opportunity for experiencing self yes, uh we also call that the linear style I'll have to do a little sketch on that one day but the finer to find the Bobby to Robert and I know to send say to the great sense8 uh we need some practice there so that's why we've presented it one by two by three by Bad Day fair day good day great day to get a little practice with that okay but then there's a certain point where you got a pretty good sense you've been experiencing let's hope these changes, and then it's like enough is enough let's cut to the chase let's go more original that's inner finer again but to more original in this case underlying self the self that's there okay, did we diverge into a different topic doesn't matter uh and the self that's there has its own energies let's say and it will highlight enhance it will enhance, the energies of the uh situation has its own energies and character has its own energies when we harmonize those blend those unified field with those, unified field with those okay a fair amount of energy there but when you touch the underlying self it has its own energy so there's an, enhancement possibility an enhancement possibility an enhancement possibility Autumn you got that this is important uh we presented this to you I think before that if we can get that all those lined up right you should be special as you meant to be Autumn did you hear me yes sense and for everybody not just Autumn for all of you if I pick a person I'm talking to everybody okay ah where the hell are we okay, self-enhancing the energies of the character and the situation to start with yeah, you're in a situation, that has Energies and your character will respond the centered character will respond to that okay either it'll scare you or it'll excite you or it'll enhance you okay but let's get to the enhancement part because that's the real thing that this field of energy and this field of energy okay with each other to be a unified field okay, or to be that said and I'm calling that set a very good set to continue doing some really advanced work that's why I brought up the, self that underlies all of this we're not going to major in self tonight but I just want to mention it that that's the direction we're going more original as opposed to finer and finer and finer am I babbling here uh you're okay with this uh B I don't know let me go into a story I think we have enough time uh in my earlier years I loved the centered character part right, and I really was doing well with that I was developing well uh and I was using it upbeat of energy and a downbeat of energy now just for the character I wasn't including situation really okay just what we call the centered character and that was very coming along very well very well is developing well okay and then one night I'm at the dojo by myself and I'm playing with my favorite up and down beats and the ever increasing enhancement of who I was with those up and down beats okay Mark somebody's phone is ringing here turn that off yeah oh that sounds fun I've never used it we have a house phone I never use it anyway I'm getting lost oh so there I am in, the dojo doing my favorite up and down beats that I'm really pretty good with I'm doing well with it and suddenly something began to change, and there was this extra energy and it was like ah I really got pissy when energy comes around for me my first thing is, a power form of it that's me okay my, thing uh and it's like what the hell's happening I'm losing my beautiful up and down Improvement beats and something else is happening okay now I don't have it down pat at that time I don't know what this is but now, I'd say because one of the Beats one, of the energy Fields the up and down energy, Fields the up and down energy field was pretty good the other energy field was trying to show it was there I'd call it the circular situational I was trying to show it was there but that increase of energy that suddenly the circle Parts like I'm here and I do it this way it has a reverse on that spiral okay I didn't know quite what it was and it just really threw me and aggravated me because it was throwing me off I was unable to sustain my beautiful up and down up Improvement Factor so I don't know why I did the rest of the evening with it but I eventually slowly began to figure this out okay so I think the key point to get across is as things move along be prepared for an increase of energy for example with the two fields of energy okay, let's say you're more of a center type now when the circular or situational field of energy kicks in uh it doubles up could we say it doubles up it's not just your character energy but it's a situational energy and there's an increase of energy, and there's an increase of energy so you best be prepared to be open there okay, give yourself a bit more room so easy open more room are we could continue that make sure that's going on all along the way here okay so that you realize it's not tearing you apart it just wants to show that it's there and it's more juice than heretofore in certain way you've doubled up, okay, then, anchor then when you if you continue to more original and do this, properly don't know what word to use and the self starts to show same thing will happen there could be in the early stages before you realize it's a self just being bumped and you're being thrown off potentially okay some people yep uh I think everyone should be prepared to open for it because you want to recognize it sooner easy Don't Panic something's going on here easy, a little more room easy and then the self will show that hey it's just me I'm called self and I am here, and then the added juice of self enhances the juice of, the two other fields that we started with I sometimes call them A and B creates a good one which connects doorways to self which I call two I'm uh trying to use numbers as well since I presented them to, me and then we know as we continue, we get to the one two three four of things the bigger finer clearer of what circle is and the design construct of creation okay, I said a lot that I Babble it out too weird, it's gonna say could you go back over that last part there we went from one to two to four hey I used an A B Harmony that's what we're laying out tonight and then, character as we know the body character, as we know the body character let's say to the situation situations energies back to the character, and gets enhanced back to the situation it's a potted plant set up if I had my potted plant picture do you have it Lauren did you take it when you were here, yes, I'll find out okay don't look for that picture Lauren has it I'll find it just a moment please yeah it's okay anyway so the nutrients of the potted plant or Circle part feed and enhance the plant or character the plant again reaches out to the soil within that pot and boom enhanced so it's a mutual Harmony of the nutrients of the soil and the plant not just knowing there's energies but the actual experience the enhancement of the fullness of the character so, there's that, two beat there in a potted plant farm okay anyway so you want to know about one two three four uh and uh so I diverged didn't I okay so I use a B for our starting when they're unified using that they're that there when they're Unified okay I'm calling that unified one I don't know what to call them the real character the proper character or whatever you want to call them but is that the character lineage okay that character is one it's a doorway there to the underlying self that's there two okay as we continue in more room where things can show themselves Fuller and better than potentially uh the finer of the circle will show but okay or space I guess we call it we'll chill and the construct will want to show one two three four okay Lauren you happy with that is that good enough for now yes thank you okay foreign [Music], stuff uh to give you a heads up on it and the domain it's is that what I call the domain level okay this next major level I call domain and the one two three four Auto Show much better than how they relate how they overlay that should show much better in the domain okay, uh but let's, sort of uh I don't know what wait till we get there I don't know what words to use uh so what we're doing now is setting it up to make a proper approach okay, so I'm saying again the a b the two energy fields we're using character in situation, related to the character that we need some Harmony blue Blended Harmony and I borrowed Moon's favorite phrase unified field and that unified field is nice all by itself okay you're, the person is in harmony with situation, supporting the person yes, yes that's real nice but it's also a doorway all right all right so some people say oh this is nice enough leave me alone I'm out of here I got it others will be none there's something more there's something more and those other people I would like to talk to okay that's a doorway right there to the self that's there I'm trying to give you a heads up again with certain things when you reach that level and self begins to show it might begin to show for some people like an extra boom of energy because it has its own energy okay which may bump you and disturb you and sort of throw you off a little bit at first but easy Don't Panic easy open and it'll clarify itself okay oh potty plan, yeah, something like that and anyway uh and thank you Lauren you can erase that one thank you thank you, okay, uh I'm all over the place people where are you two fields of energy then say this is Justin something that you've, been emphasizing along the way here is how critically important space, room is in this equation because if, there isn't an appropriate amount of space the energies won't mix up and balance you can't see you can't experience yeah just to give them room to tell their story clearly yeah oh real one by one type can really catch on to this it's just too tight things easy settle open Easy settle open Easy settle open get the word more space helps find easy settle open there is more space easy, easy okay where they put me in solitary confinement there for a little bit uh I had to play that game of oh more space because the physical space was very tight, different story we won't get into that one people anyway but as you're saying and the, energy is of the intensity of the situation and character, might be too, big for mixing up properly without the room is situation character but intensity also yeah, and again by law at each level they want to harmonize that harmonization is an original the way it was created so that desire to harmonize exists all the way ding, ding, ding, you know I when I was a kid we'd pick up uh we call them night crawlers or big worms that we pick up at night and now and then you'd see them doing their thing wrapped around each other uh so there's an attraction to each other it's all the way down the line I got two doves that I feed here every day and it's two and they're Buddies you know and the J's too and he comes first for the food she comes second he's a bit pushy that way uh but this attraction this attraction is a built-in thing so character the situation, to character is built in by law all we have to do is learn to ride it and not interfere and to experience it finer and finer really experience not just know about that's nice start your gun that's the library now we fun around a bit that's a laboratory now we really begin to experience that's the gymnasium hello sensei uh let me tell you another story these are examples of storage right um free excelling I'm I continue to develop and doing quite well I think uh my personal little outer teaching but I'm developing quite well so what happens because I'm developing quite well the excellent happening sits this bigger situation, had to happen because I was going so well with this field of energy that this field of energy trying to balance out with it boom gave me a bigger venue other than my dojo and the locals whatever it was okay it was fine good training ground but then the awesome thing had to happen and it just happened I didn't go hunting for it I didn't go pounding on their door asking for a job it happened but in a certain way it had to happen part of me was developing quite well the other part wanted to say oh I'm a partner to that let me show myself let me be here near Zealand did I present that story okay as an example story well you used to say get your inner thing together your outer thing will take care of itself and I have a whole bunch of similar things and we were just talking with a guy who he's just been invited to do some even as our Consulting work to do some work at Buckingham Palace and they just called him and he said this all this stuff's been falling into place I want to make sure I send him the video of this so he can refer to this part of it because he was curious why it was happening and I think you're talking about that about that yeah it sounds like doesn't it yeah, send me whatever it is on there and we can go either way on a better character, and situation will begin to feed it or we can go situation better situation better character works both ways okay yeah, so as the young man trains or plays ball and Sandlot ball and just developed himself and develop himself it's not a surprise that the big leagues Scout spots him and brings him to the big leagues it's sort of almost bound to happen, now it'll happen better if we can act activate I don't know if that's the right word because they're Natural Forces but yeah I'll be involved with them be involved with them uh but let's use the word activate knowingly experientially activating them boom so what happens activate them so it happens yeah, there's I'm not versed on thinking your way to riches but there's probably something in there that's very similar to, this there's a way of whatever their presentation is it's an old if people don't know that both it's an old it's been on the best seller list for a lot 50 years or something it's, been around a long time and still it's a great seller uh but suddenly how to be so that in this case riches can come to you boom, so there's some pattern in there that sure as hell is similar to our pattern I just never got enough into the book to figure out their pattern I was busy enough with my patterns stop me before I spout more where are we continue Bob what else you got to say here, uh since I, think the thing that you're identifying which you've talked about before including very recently is when you sense an interruption in your pattern, whether it's the situation or the character or the uh the unified field and the self that when you sense that Interruption you want to recognize that for what it is not as a bad thing but as the more reaching out to you yeah and at first you, don't know how it works so when you get bumped you get burnt I'm telling you that night in a dojo and I'm happy with my up and down beats and I'm doing fantastic with it that we have an old-time relationship there things are moving along great with it and suddenly bump, oh all right and getting knocked out of my Basics something's happening I don't know what it is and it's stronger and I'm getting pissy when it's stronger at first I'd figure it out uh so it's good to know that as you progress uh don't be surprised by an increment of energy or a bump or what's your other word Bob a disturbance yes disruption yeah disruption yeah it's okay it's okay easy don't panic better get a little more room there easy, Don't Panic I'm just gonna try to figure it out easy, open Easy give it room to clarify give it room to clarify Sensei one thing you've taught us that has been helpful to me my whole life is yes if you sense that disruption recognize it for what it is but you've also taught us to actually go out and invite it in on purpose and when you can do that it helps to minimize the disruption and smooth the progress a little bit I'm trying to remember when that first came up and I'll just say it a little bit better uh but for, me trying to remember uh I guess it happened earlier in, my career uh where I'm okay with energy certain energies I'm okay allowing and then a different quality energy would show and bump me okay and I got tired of being bumped okay, uh so I thought well maybe a good trick here is to be a little more open and with the sense of high all the energies that would like to be here in my system whatever I'd say in those days uh please I'm open for you today please be present hoping that by doing that they wouldn't have to butt me unexpected when I wasn't ready for them I thought or, they would catch me off guard so to speak that if I then said hey welcome that I would facilitate less, time you know when you say welcome they might like to just hang I'm sorry I I'm sorry essentially somebody's phone was open I'm sorry it was just noise oh just noise okay noise okay no noise I make enough noise here okay so Harmony, using Center and the situation or the character in the situation as two Fields okay we've played with some of this in different ways we have a chanting form that we've played with uh, I think we did a, a, yay [Music] they're responding mommy till they felt experience more harmonious, okay, not just the listening for the harmony that's, part of it that's part of the trip here but the feeling of those as a vibration could I say and feel it those are vibrations feel them Mommy in that one the harmony the felt a more harmonious they felt little, bitter related okay uh so we've done so there's chanting from we, did uh ah to the old to the r we use that uh we're just playing with, Harmony okay uh [Music] uh movement forms I I'm doing one now uh situation energy in, character is affected by those characters a little more uh unsafe pill uh let's say uh a little Fuller for our character back to the outer, back to the inner more fulfillment more Equalization inner to Outer, to Inner again similar to the Potted Plant thing okay but I just don't want to keep the plant as separate from the soil nutrients of the of the pot uh there's a place there where there's more sharing okay uh it's as if I don't know is this right are we grinding up the plant mixing it with the soil so it's all one thing I don't know if that's right I'm going crazy over here help where are we Steve I see your face say something semi-intelligent help me out here well let me try uh well I, guess I worked I worked today on, that blend of, character and situation which by opening it up more fully it's exactly what you said self starts to show it's, just naturally I wasn't looking for self I wasn't I was just you know processing character processing situation allowing those to just mix and, it's, like the sun peeping through the clouds um it just starts to show itself naturally yeah and, maybe I like the way you said it maybe at first peeps through the crop Cloud before it's a full presentation of self so to recognize that beeping instead of what is that disturbing my, nice game I've got going here what's that thing peeping over my shoulder the easy open continue and the Fuller of it gets to show and you recognize that oh yeah that's self okay it'll what in some form name itself in the beginning okay but you now know it's there so you know what it is who it is right yeah and it's there within itself alive so we've got this field of energy that field of energy, that field of energy harmonize there's your door away then you got the self that's there with its even finer better energy could I say and it enhances character in a situation, in the character it enhances and that's what I've been uh hoping that Autumn catches fairly clear because I think that's the that could be that thing yeah, the thing here okay uh, you, said some you said something a little bit before where you were I didn't maybe I just didn't hear it clear enough and it, almost it almost sounded like, you were connecting space which I always tend to start with before I even do anything get out of my room look at my room let's not maybe, let's not give a little more room the designation of the Great Space one of the great four maybe let's not do that yet so fast but a little more room a little more room and if it turns into a more original space fine but I don't think we gotta make it this is the more original space it's a little early I'm not gonna do that but a little more room easy who's just setting the stage for the, character and, the situation to yeah to um blend with each other yeah in his childish form it's just a little more room eventually it probably is the great granddaddy of space but you don't have to jump to the great granddaddy play it where you're at a little more room here a little more room here a little more room yeah okay, must be a better way of saying that but I thought that wasn't too bad the other day I asked if you would please distinguish between space and situation, situation space is space it's its own thing situation it's situation it's its own thing I don't know how to distinguish I'm not sure ask me again I'm kind of dumb remember, it seems like it's it seems like situation is a kind of external environment uh circumstances that find yourself it exists in the space but I exist in this space, but I exist in this space the plant over there exists in a space the, conscience is in, the space there is space and space is its own thing and much more than we know oh yeah space more room in my measuring yardstick out here yes more room I got it uh this we're, gonna head towards more earlier presentation uh a more original sense that space has with itself as one of the big four okay so watch out for the human oh yeah space Oh yeah to get the telescope and they see into more space yeah, yeah, yeah all that's going on within the face okay, so I'm just not sure if you're looking and playing with space with face yeah space yeah see you might lean that way could you send me those nice pictures of uh pictures of the universe as they're able to take newer pictures these days I said yeah it's big and interesting and beautiful, but the space I'm talking about is this inner sense experience of space of which all of that is contained within at this level the space that's contained within the Great Space is the space of my living room here this, space but if you give me a telescope no one of the big Scopes and I see space that's contained within the big space so I'm not sure how you're approaching me on I'm not sure how I'm hearing it when you get to the domain area on in my room by using the one of character fully and the two of self it should after a bit open up even more or, the other pieces want to present you get one two three and four will want to present, okay, and then hanging out experiencing what space is experiencing not this outer space of Sierra there's Saturn over there what's experiencing something different inner, inner and space is aware experiencing itself as space the other one the construct the design it's experiencing itself as the design part of creation those aren't my major my majors has been the one and two you want to talk about three and four talk to Jack loves three and four but to continue with this he's practicing with the one and two so he can do what we're doing if he does what we're doing then his, relationship his Pleasant relationship his interest in three and four we'll start to shine but he has to one and two a bit to get through this that way one and two self and three and four will enhance him at a domain level but we're getting too far ahead now foreign lose you throw too much out at you let's be happy are you okay Lord if you're not tough talk to me tomorrow over coffee you're buying uh so tonight character and situation and situation and character as energy feel not just the idea oh yeah okay, I'm trying to speed things up I'm feeling people want to move along want to get into more original okay, and for example the sense of situation uh, let's use a martial art kind of setup for those of you who do Aikido for example uh okay here's the situation oh my God that guy's got thick written hell of a big biceps and that guy over there he's long he's got reachability oh, my uh what should I do here to cope with that you ain't got time or sense they didn't do that okay he said oh I'll say it my way situation energy field Bing and the character equal to it Bang and disharmony plus the sales and all that uh oh sensei's level boom things have just happened okay but I, want to get away from too much what I call it uh itemizing or there's a situation and, in that situation my shoulder Twitches up in that situation my jaw gets tighter in that situation my heart beats a little faster and that's I'm tired of all the details, okay most of you want to cut to the chase, all right so we've played with some of the details okay just give you a sense of how it works at level one and level two in Robert's level and how Nado is better than Robert enough, more original B is kind of a different take we've done improvement, improvement you get the flavor of it good practice experiencing for one thing okay but now let's cut to the chase my words, more original of course it's interior sensing, okay, and we brought you to a place here with this, Harmony of these two forces which every day we're involved with okay Harmony or unified field it's a doorway underlying the doorway is a self a self that enhances the character situation set okay so I thought that itself was a pretty good piece of work that I get lost myself that I misunderstand it help teacher you haven't said anything where the hell are you tonight I'm just paying attention here um I think if I was going to say something about this it would be to hearken back to, the word harmony because I think you've laid out and I'm, pretty sure Folks at this point have a, good sense of what the situation is and what the uh what the character is but the experience of Harmony that's I think that's what you're really pointing to because that is the that's the actual uh focal point that's the vortex, in which the, potential transformation uh can take place yeah so the experience of Harmony and what that actually is not as if not even so much as a feeling because we talk about feeling a lot but as a idea feeling finer feeling finer sensing sense feeling experience experiential can I write that down yeah, very good yeah, so the, the experience of the experience of Harmony um you know we can talk a lot about it but, it is uh it's that deep, felt sense uh sensing that I of that, is the actual the portal that you've been talking about you talked about the uh the Gateway but by any word by any whether it's portal or Gateway whatever word you like right there right portal Gateway opening uh window uh I'm sure that all those words have been used and a dozen more so that well for, instance in for me in improvisation and this, can also happen certainly in like rondori or juwaza in that context but in improvisation for me in, playing there's a whole way that I drop under the cognitive thinking about the scale that I'm playing thinking about what I'm gonna do next none of that exists in, the deeper improvisation I'll just bet that uh that Autumn uh in her acting finds you know gets into that zone from time to time too and others, of us on the call each has you know their own gift or their thing that they're developing or have developed their lineage the word zone is good because it's an old word in the athletic oh the uh quarterback whoa he was in the zone today man he could hardly do any wrong he just spotted them and it went to them he was in the zone in the zone yes and you can't make himself trying to figure out and trying to whatever he was at a certain level yeah level words like that tend to come up he's in the groove he's in the zone he's in the flow whoa yes that's along the way very good you can't make that happen as a top down but you can help to set up like what we're doing here you can set up the conditions in which it potentially uh shows it potentially that mix that experience of Harmony is taking place yeah you know so you can be you can be sure than your quarterback uh example that he's not thinking I'm gonna if I only just drop in I can get into the zone that he's miles away from that he's already deeper in his own experience of the harmony of the situation that he's in and then the character then the character just gets into its his Zone and it you know use any uh use any example that you want to do, isn't it with a little practice you know the one by thing a little practice after all the zone is much closer boom yes, the practice again sets up the conditions it doesn't create the harmony it sets up the conditions for the harmony I mean that's the distinction you're not interfering with it you're not interested in the speed of it the noun is of it yes that's right that's, kind of how that's what practice is like cutting away all the dumb interfering that we do something yeah, and then of course at the beginning you know whether that's on the Aikido mad or, in the practice room you know yeah or you can start you you're playing you've got to develop certain essential skills until they're embedded until they're embodied you don't have to think about them after that you can spend some time from time to time uh checking in with that but that's not the emphasis the emphasis is not the better nikio from uh a million repetitions so that whole thing that you remember the how we used to talk about the, ten thousand repetitions to, gain mastery, and kind of the, fallacy of that ten thousand repetitions then you're a master of something you have and after ten thousand reps your body is totally collapsing it doesn't work you can't throw another that's right but you can't move your wrist anymore uh your knees are out your knees are dying definitely no that doesn't mean that, setting up the foundation with good with good skill practice isn't necessary but at a certain point if you just only focus on the skill there you're like well that's extrinsic work thank you to Value yourself to register yourself yes get a stronger technique I must be a better person whoops now we're in trouble now we're in trouble and why hasn't Sensei given me the rank right because I'm so much better now oh sad, yeah good thanks that's what I had to contribute thank you okay where in hell are we uh but again to play again I laid out the some of the Library part of it now laboratory is where you lay in some form this sense of uh energy field, it looks like a body I treat it like a body you know yes okay but now let's move faster or better Easy more open it's an energy field well at first my all my senses don't know it's a body yeah, of course at first, energy field this is an energy field in related to situational energy field really but, there's also something there some, bit of a touch on a touch, and I continue I'm in the laboratory and I'm practicing I'm hunting around did the laboratory becomes the actual more experienced gymnasium which whoa wow, where it's an experience a finer dimensional level sense experience I don't know how to say it any better if you don't practice or play take advantage of uh laboratory time then this is just a lecture series and that kind of gets to be kind of after a while what are you going to do with it broaden your mind read a book this express it in much finer language than not though ever will you gotta play you gotta fun around you gotta experiment okay you see me light up when certain people present me with their examples of the week and, it's very obvious they've been playing and experimenting and mulling and playing and experimenting and I light up yes, okay, [Music], yeah, hey Tom how you doing I saw your face I said hi Tom oh hi Sensei how are you thank you I I'm just sitting here and listening to Tisha and, what you're saying and, it just comes to make to the realization that in this bigger space is bigger Universe we really only know five percent of what of what's out there even with the big telescopes exploring as far as they are we still have no five percent lucky if we go five percent but some of them it's good enough it is yeah, and I mean the harmony is knowing that we're still connected to everything that's unseen and unknown and it just gives a sort of grounding that I don't need to know everything I don't to be in harmony with the space I'm in or in harmony with the situation I don't need to have it all examined and figured out and lined up but also isn't in the experience of it also the knowledge is aware of itself it experiences itself it's aware of itself the intelligence that's inherently there any piece can be experienced Einstein do that he experienced what he was studying or his, lineage his job he experienced it okay that's the harmony yeah, yeah and people misconstrue say oh what a big brain he had and he, very clearly said that's not the thing here it's not my big brain it's this what we're talking about this ability to experience so that was his area of experiencing yeah, um and we all have the capability of experiencing something at finer levels okay, so I'm not going to try to be Einstein okay that was his route I'm not going to try to pick up the guitar and learn a bunch of stuff that's that other guy what's his name Tisha that's his thing I got my thing my thing okay and we'll get into that too I'll throw you a new word one day uh but uh since they inferred how personal this trip becomes that you've got your I don't know the words here right now personal style your personal colorings I have presented that in the past that your mixture of colors is different than my mixture of colors but how the colors work or how to open to them now that's something that's similar all around the colors you'll get are your colors, you'll get are your colors okay, so I, tell people when I play with more energy the time you remember I do the monster form or more energy and I'm sure that scares people that's instantly not have learned to say that's me that's me the Earth might be more loving or more caring or more awareness first and I enjoy um I showed you my, beloved Uh Wood block preserves Laurel uprooting the bamboo, I love that that's me okay, all right and I know it's grossacker level but the essence of it the power of creation wow and the ability of experiencing some of it, and continuing to get to the original source of all power at the beginnings of creation that's, really what I'm doing don't mind at first I'm just trying to show something yeah I remember getting carried away because I tell me anything more here intelligent well I, also think the chanting that you, introduce to us and, it gives us that ability to connect with go beyond what we are so uh how do you say this go beyond the words go beyond the mundane and connect with something that's bigger and greater Within excuse me my practice and I'm practicing dying oh man we all agree or most everybody would agree on Harmony oh yes there should be more Harmony oh I Believe In Harmony I love the idea of Harmony and they're talking about it okay nice idea now let's sit settle open okay and you may have a different style than sitting but excuse me right now subtle open and begin to actually experience what is harmony the actual experience of it and then the Fuller experience is the Fuller more knowledge about, the right phrasing more knowledge about Harmony yeah, so that's the important part and that's where a lot of people don't go to they stay in the words the idea whatever that's fine it's a fine starting place but they stay there and that starts to bother me we're not going to get anywhere if you stay there talking more words okay and get other people to agree with your words don't you believe Harmony is great yes I believe Harmony is great, yes I believe Harmony is great well let's start We Believe Harmony is great club and we'll talk more about Harmony, if nothing happens it's okay but not for me not for Tom yeah so experience idea, feeling finer feeling more open room to facilitate easy the eye to facilitate, easy the eye to facilitate the more experience can happen okay thank you Cincy I have something to share this is Linda Morris Linda yes can you can you hear me yes okay um I spoke to my granddaughter today I'm thinking that sometimes these things happen even unaware even unaware that they're happening right and so she was on her she's, been on a campaign this day today to go interview for new jobs and she got rescheduled for one at eight o'clock this morning and she's on eight o'clock in the morning person she got there and waited 20 minutes for the person to show up and then they didn't show up and she said I wouldn't want a job at that place and right then and there she realized what she wanted what that they need to want her and that what she what she needed in a job so she went to the next interview and she was so confident and so uh turned on by the by the confidence that she had gained that she just breezed through that one and they wanted her but she told them I'm going to another interview and, they were impressed even with the fact that she was that much of a go-getter so when I spoke to her she was on her way to her third interview of the day and she was so jazzed and she was so up and she was so turned on by all that had happened I just feel like this is sort of an example of what you're describing am I right yeah and we don't know sometimes how things happen uh for example the person she's supposed to meet not being there uh was just the situation saying no honey we don't want you here really, I don't know if some of those little details work okay but there is a relationship between character and situation, and character that is by law trying to work better and better so all we're trying to do is line up to, get more, involved to get involved at finer levels with this natural happening thing uh so uh to come into the actual physical world, and did that mean that was happening uh there are certain levels of that I don't know, I don't know if the blind date I was set up to go on which is not yesterday at Mary radar uh blind Dales have been gone and she cancels for some reason uh does that mean I wasn't supposed to meet her I meant for somebody else and that was a sign from God that it wasn't her you had your soul made out of here someplace else I don't know but let's get more in harmony with this how this works so that things that happen are clearer and Fuller and faster and obvious as hell kind of thing okay so yeah thank you yeah, yeah well Sensei if I can speak up for Linda's granddaughter she seems to be actually following exactly what you've been describing tonight she was in a situation, her character responded she didn't like the way she was treated and she understood something about herself that she didn't want that kind of job and that empowered her okay so that's just that right beat right there was an improvement of her where she felt empowered good yeah you're, on a real hair Lauren go well her we would call it self-knowledge she realized what she didn't want and that helped her find what she wanted and give her the strength the doubling up of energy, right that carries her through the other interviews as, Linda described I think that you're the key point was that the situation put her she found herself in a situation that and she recognized it and she suddenly knew that about herself and that was empowering I think I wasn't there but that's what I heard the story and it fits exactly with what you've been talking about tonight so thank you ah okay we're edging uh Susan I haven't heard from you are you on Susan are you stuck in the snow someplace she's here she's here she's online at least, students and say something come on you can do it I am in the snow I don't know if you can we hear you Susan can you hear me we can oh good you following our conversation okay here in the healing field that's fit into the case I am say what you're losing she said she's following it but now we haven't no uh yeah, I'm here um yeah I think what Lauren pointed out um with Linda's granddaughter was really good and that happens, in the clinic where you know the situation patient will present itself or present themselves, and, I as a character you know respond to and with that situation, and like somebody else pointed out earlier you know the more I open up the Spade the more that situation can, clarify verify yeah let me uh hair maybe paraphrase but she's saying so Susan now getting the ability of work we're doing with a patient first of course you say the obvious the physical ailments or whatever, whatever, but in the opening finer dimensional sensing that the situation that the person is in will start to show to Susan okay, so Susan I'd say psychically uh but there'll be because you you're in finer and you're allowing this picture yourself first and then the patient uh situations will often show to her showing a showing a why this person is this way or doing that or having that problem is, that I paraphrase you okay Susan so in working with young, children what are you talking about here Susan three-year-olds two-year-olds whatever uh they can't talk about their problems spiritually right but in this ability that she's getting and improving on weekly yes uh this unfolds this becomes very clear that she could there's an availability of seeing sensing experiencing things that the child is experiencing the child in their situation is experiencing from the situation and in some cases the confusion of self potentially of self's little confusion which is adding to the screw-ups here yes and what's really important that I'm learning to be better and better at is not getting caught up in looking at the situation or trying to figure the situation out or, yeah trying to trying to look too hard sometimes yeah experience it let it unfold a bit yeah, yeah that's really important yeah and the more I trust that will happen the more it does happen but if I get caught up in looking for things or listening for things, or listening for things that really stops that process yeah remember we're still in The Human Condition so the potential for I gotta know I gotta grab on to something distinct is essentially always there easy, we're doing it different now easy yeah so you don't try to glom anymore yeah let it in the opening let it clarify give it a room yeah uh you can even dialogue with it because everything's intelligent like could you clarify that I sort of saw something but I wasn't sure what I saw please clarify it which saves me a lot I gotta figure that out that out a little bit of that but let it unfold let it clarify let it name itself Let It Whatever is part, of the game yeah yes, oh thank you sensei Susan, should I Susan yes, yes, should we bring up this new thing that just happened no not yet okay [Music] oh a mystery to present one day it's a tease such a tease such as I know she always was anyway okay we're reaching me in here I smell dinner cooking where are you at people finishing up there what you got what you got this is Justin I just want to jump in with one more thing real quick because it's been it's been gnawing at me but you guys were just talking about it this idea of dialoguing, from a sense feeling or sensing level and, allowing the, the energy is to tell, more about themselves reveal their story to uh to go through some depth with them a little bit this is very interesting what's coming through I sense feel whatever oh tell me more about that elaborate what how else would you describe yourself given more room how do you line yourself up, and what else would you say how can you rephrase what that is so maybe I can line up to that in a way that, is more familiar to me you know yeah, Etc et cetera yeah good yeah no there's always more we have to learn a couple of tricks to continue with more I was just thinking uh, for a quick example I think of what you said uh when I was a dog whisperer talked to dogs uh I had that capability for oh I had a lot of different capabilities along the way here that was one of them and people used to uh I've gone to the Pyrenees Club so there's a lot of Pyrenees people would call me and hearing I could talk to the dog and one dog was not getting along well with the owner and I said what's up to the dog and the dog said uh and she's got this collar and one of those electronic callers where he is kid Zapped the dog from across the block or something and the guy was over using it and the dog knowing there was a relationship between this caller and that guy his owner it's starting to get a little pissy about it but I didn't continue I, said oh that's pretty good information I passed it on to the guy stop it with the collar right, but I didn't continue it and say by the way, how would you relate better with your owner just in general how would you relate better well what would make for a better relationship I didn't go there I could have I just didn't think to do that I was happy that I could get the owner to stop zinging them all the time but there's more there's more there's more, all right but we tend to get a nice piece of information we get results and we're satisfied there yes of course but some place finally and there is more and there's more I know I'm a pain in the ass to people because they get sort of comfy and I come up kind of immediately and say there's more and they say Jesus leave me alone let me let me hang here for a while yes you're, allowed to but if you're hanging there for years after year after year at that same level uh, [Music], uh ah what a shame what a shame so yes there there's always more finer whatever yes, thank you for reminding me about that story, people finishing up anything, on this layout of harmonizing the two fields of energy anything that clarified anything for you just with that just with that situation character, situation as energy fields, finer feeling sense feeling the actual energy Harmony of that anything that zinged you hi Sensei this is Andrew, not too sure if this is related but um I recently picked up improv theater I read your thing yeah okay yeah um and one of the things that they teach us is um to it's, a concept called yes and, basically what it means is whatever your partner in that scene is doing uh you simply just accept it and you harmonize with them um it's, best in fact they, hammered in that it's best to Simply accept what they give that's not just like a very good short presentation of what we're trying for situation maybe changes just be okay with it to start this harmony potential going yes yeah yes yeah, um and uh my journey has been just um doing this concept of just accepting and harmonizing um I found myself sometimes like I would intentionally oh I don't like that harmonize I don't like what my partners you know doing I'll change it a certain way and then I would go back realizing oh I should have just harmonized and stuff and it's been a very good journey just kind of you know whatever the situation is um if it requires me to be a father a pet or whatever the scene requires uh yeah it's good practice yeah good practice, yeah I don't care for that situation particularly but for practice let me see boom bang, boom let me see what happens if I just practice with it yeah cool yeah cool eight o'clock I'm out of here thank you people thank you Sensei I hope you got something out of this thank you thank you Sensei thank you thank you

good evening hi okay you've had a, week to play with this to mull on this to experience this any comments how you doing with that finish up last week here well so this is Lauren and I really got the top part of this diagram last week but I, didn't the bottom part of the diagram the circle with the dotted line around it I, tell you I didn't I didn't get it this infers that uh they'll overlay so here's the overlaid version there's both a self and a character aligned hopefully with that self that's, uh, obvious no now that you explain it I don't know why I didn't see it yeah, they're real uh could I say uh everything in the system is a buddy with everything else but certain ones at first are real buddies so character itself are real buddies that's one reason people have trouble telling them apart they're real buddies you know uh, I don't remember I mentioned it last week but uh self could be sense experience as a field okay, whereas especially earlier in the practices the character will be a character will be embodied okay and even the earlier parts of uh, uh I'm going to link on Words again archetype characters archetype characters at first are embodied okay so one of my archetype characters uh first one that kicks in for me is, a Buddha type oh, deep-seated wisdom and but there's a there's a character there's a Buddha flavor that I get to experience so self is more like a field later more and more a clear field kind of thing and characters will retain this sense of uh let's have body mechanism whatever make up your own words somebody anything last week inside questions that may or may not be answered Sensei this is Justin I've got a question for you okay um so I, was mulling on what you presented last week and working with it um quite a bit this week and I I'm glad now in retrospect that you drew the eye as a little eye instead of a big eye because for me the, big I Capital might represent I the self here and now but the little I is completely different so my sense of things is that uh the little I it has its own sense of identity that's created from our programming or our experiences when we're little or growing up more likely than a one by one kind of setup yeah uh and it, limits if it's tight it limits our ability to, be aware and experiencing what the functional self or functional character is going through but it has its own it's very am I off The Mark with this uh it seems to be shaped from our programming things we've been conditioned to learn or maybe we're misunderstanded misguided about things and it makes up its own lens if you will yeah, cool I, like the way you say how did you infer or refer to the, larger eye well I remember you and Katya were going back and forth a bit and the big capital I the Roman numeral looking like is a big eye for me the big eye represents the self here and now I and the little I has its own sense of identity much smaller okay built into a go ahead so uh could you mention that because one day I'm gonna have to uh so we easy the eye and he's a pain in the ass at that level yeah what are you talking about I don't understand and I don't want to I mean that okay pain in the ass so easy the eye in more space more room so that, can show okay as we continue with easy the eye and more and more begins to show there's still I don't know how to say this they got to be careful there's still an eye present and but it's the eye kind of that you're referring to it's not I it's uh how, are you referring to it sounded pretty good it's more encompassing I think of the eye the big guy here big eye great eye the um Here and Now ever present the I constant here and now I uh yes and even as we develop uh it'll come back where you want to say okay at this level who am I here and you don't mean that little lie no exactly little lie construct programmings came to mind it's conditioned it's programmed from its experience yes exactly yes, yes you see that on easy, Sensei teacher here if I can jump in here with Justin for uh and you for a moment because I really appreciated what uh Justin had to say about the uh the I and the Here and Now when referring to the smaller eye the one that's on top that gets kind of pressed down and squished it's um I don't know if I've used this language with you before but it is an it's a an inner narrative in other words it's the, Narrative that's going on about ourselves that we have to easy so Justin I don't know if that's it is conditioned it's all those things that you mentioned but it also is that, inner way that we talk about ourselves it's a narrative it's the narrative self is the smaller self very much so that, helps tremendously it doesn't have the authenticity of actual experience uh it's, yeah, yeah, I've been thinking I've been thinking I've been thinking about that's, small eye the, relative self as uh as being a narrative self conditioned as it is by experiences and all the things and, since then I were talking about that self and how the universe, uh when energy comes in if you can't easy the eye there if you can't let go it gets more contracted you know rather than a wonderful stronger a certain way it gets inflated with extra energy so he's an idiot but he's a strong idiot he's a determined idiot or something he's got more energies in there and that's a caution you know yes there yeah right exactly rather than that one by to a two byte becomes a one by two like a half by yeah, can I just uh throw in uh one little uh adjunct to that for me the little eye seems like the me, me, me uh you know I mean mine uh kind of thing uh very possessive where's the, capital I that you know Justin is talking about seems like that, notion of I am in, the in the more broad sense of I am that present here now I am unconditioned perhaps yeah, yeah you know I wanted to say um you know as the eye gets easier that narrative seems to shift to one of witnessing or observing what's happening through the functioning character and it doesn't do a whole lot but just Witnesses it's just present yes, as it gets easier excellent, [Music], um thank you gentlemen I don't think we've ever had four people on the screen at the same time but this is a milestone I guess it's Lauren's great skill as a facilitator here or maybe it's maybe it's uh Kenny oh both of them it's me tonight okay and again the importance has come up a couple times in the past but this sense of, self, then it came by here now self and that the proper placement of here now self so it's in proper alignment with its character body person okay all right all right that we think again uh that if the self is more present properly in location with its character there because everything has energy but the self has a fair amount of energy because it's a little earlier if it positions its energy radiates through the body that's there and the body has its own energy but it's affected so there's an increase a kind of a doubling up increment of energy uh so anyway if you're going to play with self and character kind of double check appreciate that, I'm trying to say a lot of cells floating around don't know positioning so they over uh they're all over the place okay, and uh and uh that sense of self-present okay watch out for those kind of misunderstanding spiritual thing off myself up there in the heavens uh just here don't go anywhere else and says it's here so it's self here okay as characters here itself is here itself is there more room potential is here there's more room potential ah we'll move into the design of the creation here, okay sort of okay with that somebody anything else on uh last week's uh hit that insights questions what you do with anything that's all you're going to say that's all we get uh okay what is all this ah, okay, we're moving into construct design uh I like both words if you want to use design as the idea part of creation it designed and then the construct was the actual experiential of that with the experience actual construct of that it has a sense of its own design it can appreciate its own design so I, like the pattern of doubling up on the words and stuff which I just tried to do I don't know if I said it right but uh the design now the construction reverts it reverts it I think structure you know oh I'm a design and I appreciate myself so they're uh those are two good words when I, Milan, uh anyway uh anyway so what do we have it seems like not my first go-to I'll do the best I can I'm uh kind of I sort of and you know Sensei type we both were like centering types and then we developed uh that's why we got along uh oh, so this is one of the later things that I start to pick up so I'll do my best Vortex okay in the creation apparently it Vortex from, finer we'll use that there from an original finer it vortex, into tighter heavier matter plus okay so I'm a very fine that graduated in get heavier and heavier and some place along the heavier and heavier here we are okay no so that's the finer level to the heavier level that's what that little thing is trying to show it for Texas okay ah where do I want to go but because it vortexes is also has its own reverse beat so when it goes tighter from tighter it can go finer and finer and finer is that okay, so there's a vortex in there at some place, and another uh, example to bring up at the same time is this a concentric Circle Style uh that very similar to the vortex one way but the angle on it is different uh where the finer came in to the heavier and the heavier can return back to the finer so that's the, overlaid Circle Style yeah okay I think we've tried to show I think I tried to show you the beginnings of some of these things uh using first the body character as an example uh let me stand for a minute on this one you guys can stay Andrew you want for a moment, yeah, uh am I on the camera yes uh okay so we could say that at earlier presentation of uh the vortex for example, is, like a set reminder spirals up and spirals done and in that up and down spiral here I am and that's just and that's we get a little more room and the spirals get a little bigger can I say or better word would be finer, energy within that spiral up finer energy is coming down and as that happens ah it changes this one okay so that energy is up and down we could look at like the beginning intro so to speak to the uh Vortex style is that is that all right, Brad will you allowed me to say that okay, the other Style again I think we gave you a simple intro centered, and the energies of Center boom go out and touch the circle and the circle energies retort back to the center the center ah and the center gets enhanced by that and as the center a little more enhanced says Hey to the circle it's energy so to be touched in a circle, feels those so to speak and retards back to Center as you get a Center Circle Center Circle in a little more room in a finer dimensional level Center to the circle and give it a circle, the center and it's starting to be a change in here ah, something's happening experience okay so could we call those uh earlier intros or grammar school intros based on the, more original design of creation could, we say that okay yeah, that makes sense is that all right and that by doing starting with it I call it grammar school level starting with grammar school level and practicing experiencing then as, we move along and we get to the more original of things hopefully we're in the habit of also, experiencing that not just mentally knowing it okay see in a certain way you can say oh I understand I got it and you're gonna be able to do anything with it it's the experience that brings it to life here okay damn the words okay so we have the vortex as a main piece of the construct and or the concentric Circle Style okay uh I like the concentric Circle Style for me for me it seems to facilitate for me the Here and Now of things seems there's a little possibility on the vortex style that people say oh this is heavy and it's lighter up there in heaven and, lose the Here and Now of it so that's a little people don't have to do that but I think too many would naturally do that okay, and say oh I'm a human being and I'm here but Heaven is up here uh instead of really it's here, now here and out here now so I don't know if I said anything intelligent I don't know if I confused you no end do we have anything here this is just a reminder here of where experience this is critical I, know I keep ramming that at you but it's critical it's critical, ah just a Ancient, habit of being aware of things then we begin to mention ah there's an experience now be careful there's sort of a halfway point I call it where you're, aware that you're experiencing but you're aware of some experience it's not the fullness of the experience that's critical but since it was on that over and over again to me a deeper roots deeper roots yeah okay anyway I'm all over the place where are we, the construct the design of creation and because it's the construct and the design a lot of other things are touched by it for example I just did the body uh in a vortex early, grammar school level I did the concentric Circle or I do it with a one by two by three byte game the early introduction of that okay now Adventure yeah I'll shut up somebody where are we and then if it's coming across clear am I babbling to myself here where are we let's say this is Lauren and uh when you explain the concentric circles we often have manifest in the center I know it could be either way but for consistency it manifests and surrounded by hidden surrounded by Divine and that makes sense with the vortex with the vortex but it seems like the vortex has to have a partner that one Vortex there's a Vortex like you said there's a spiral up and a spiral down there's a spot imagine a spiral that goes from you want to go there we can go there, we can go there uh let's see how do I want to go there okay uh I think this way well if, you draw a spiral in this and the arrow points inward it probably has a partner that, that goes outward obviously you have to say that again I, got lost babbling to myself here go ahead if the vortex of creation goes from, the light to the heavy and our training through travel vehicles and other practices is to go from the heavy to the light right so we're I, feels like uh there's a Vortex of growth that's sort of spiraling outward and I'm wondering if that's if, I'm on the right track okay if I'm hearing you just change your work well outward depends I mean outward inner, finer outward within the inner not outward like from inside me to outward, like from inside me to outward physically, but from the dense to the less dense from the Manifest to the hidden to the Divine is, my growth spiral my inner growth my personal development another picture of the three layer cake here maybe the add in another example oh God uh let me see uh watch, How I performed as Lauren you're watching yes you bail yes, how would you return to Lawrence beautiful layout okay I, think I'd ask Lauren to uh since we're kind of uh working on this uh Lauren uh would you mind having yeah there we are the three of us so in, the way that you're speaking about it I'm going to ask you to, say it one more time yes so yeah if the vortex of creation naturally tends to go from the Ethereal to the Manifest and that's the natural construct of the universe okay right and our training our personal inner development is to go from the heavy to the lighter energies to the finer energies then in addition to representing that as the concentric circles it feels to me sometimes like it's a outwardly expanding spiral that is the partner if you will of the inner tightening spiral that Sensei describes as a Vortex of creation that, the, there if it's the two forces of the if the two beats of creation the inwardly heavy or heavy or heavier spiral, probably has its partner yeah they it rebounds is that what we're talking about the echo the oh sensei's great Echo Theory rebounds yeah since I'm not familiar with those sensei's Echo Theory and uh anyway um what we're talking about is, multiple layers and the oh and also the overlay of things so I think you articulated it well and as our good friend Stephen, Samuels sometimes says is easy the no you see the nose as well what he's pointing to in that is, uh easy on how we construct what we think the universe is like, so I mean I'm not saying that you're right or wrong and, in that way but I the overlay what you're talking about is the expansion and the fact that the concentric circles have a sense we have the sense of moving from the finer to the denser and your our practice in a sense, um moves from the denser to the more refined in a sense the way Sensei talks about it is the deeper finer so there you go sensei how's that hey I think you guys are great, [Laughter], thank you Sensei thank you TJ it won't quit our day tomorrow ah I don't have a day job okay let me go let me check I wanted to mention something about remember okay yeah okay yeah okay if you're going to play with construct, easy the eye more space can hurt right easy the eye more space and then you can call it whether it wants to take the turn it, whatever it is the design uh we'll start to manifest show itself okay now one thing because you're having more room and easing the eye and not sort of being more open uh that alone puts you in a more energetic size okay, so there might be some increase of energy good to be aware of it so you don't get pushed by that or make up stories about what's happening or get pushed out of the game okay, so, and, what I want to add to that was I use the word flavor that all the four main pieces are alive okay or have energy or let's say let me use a live for tonight they're all alive but in their aliveness they have their own my word tonight flavor okay so the flavor of the aliveness of self might be different than the flavor of the aliveness of the construct, okay uh so okay uh so be open give it time to present itself okay don't be too fast to judge uh don't be too fast to try to see everything and be more aware easy settle continue the opening to experience more to experience more give it give it a little time at first later things get faster and faster and faster uh but I for give it a little time to unfold itself like they're just basic tricks of the trade and again did I, don't know if I'm speaking intelligently tonight or not but, don't be in a rush don't be shocked if it's Vibes a bit different or something uh be open to being taught be open to have an experience okay and maybe teacher alluded to that when he said if you're whatever he said if you're if your sense of whatever is too strong too strong it's very hard to let the truth of the matter show if you're hanging on to how you think it is did I paraphrase you sort of okay teaser Did you sort of yeah that was good that's right it was a good paraphrase yeah if you really believe, when the truth is starting to show you won't allow it you won't accept it you'll run away from it a good Christian's gonna run right here this is something bad it's different uh foreign excuse me I'm practicing dying here I'm just getting ready the design construct of creation the construct, of creation the construct design, construct easy and open and it should begin to lay itself out so quite likely uh there'll be something centered and circled quite likely uh well there will be more energies there at whatever level you're at there will be more energies there be prepared for that easy open again the flavor somehow or tether might be different than what you're used to a bit than from of the others be okay with that not sure what I'll say here help where are we something somebody help, can't say this is Justin I, would mention at this point how you've already pointed out that these, big before interrelate to each other and support each other and while there is a vortex moving from uh heavier to finer and finer to heavier without space or room uh it's difficult for us to as a functioning character unit experience exactly where we are in the construct or design of things and get wound in pretty tightly without having the, room available critical I was there in the beginning very early in the beginning oh let's have a little space here let's have a little more space here without a make a big creation or whatever, we often wonder why in a in a specific kind of situation repetitively a working thing or whatever sometimes we feel experience moments of gracefulness and sometimes panic the energies might be increasing like you say but if the unit is being compressed within a small space we can't accommodate the energies from the designer construct so anyway that's right in my case I sometimes attract a lot of power it seems like I have to be careful because if I let that power hit me at a tight Pace what the out man okay, I'm already looking for a Stranglehold here I don't even like to front around with that, so I have my limits where I go whoa don't go out any further ah realizing it's an energy source oh what's the finer of that easy settle open I doubt it you're saying go and kill him hi what he's saying yeah I'm here to energize you Nando oh cool wait a minute let me open some more wow easy settle open, energize me and uh there's something about that was a couple of words here a couple of flavors in there uh something like the knowledge to experience this at a nicer level anyway I backtrack stuff that's, one of my main Styles I'm a good backtracker okay Bobby to Robert tonight so I, like that sense of it I'm all over the place people somebody say something intelligent stop me before I continue on well I'll just refrain then go back to what Lauren was talking about and looking at looking at, coming from the uh the finer to the more denser or to the heavier as you're saying finer energies to more, heavier energies and the, refinement in that sense being the moving from this embodiment or wherever we find ourselves and we're letting go in some ways in Easy the eye easy the easy here easy the Easy the eye easy the easy here easy the eye we're letting go of the construction of that sense of, the isolated self the one by one guy the tight eye guy whatever the tie-dye guy yes yeah I, think we've covered these Basics people right no yeah we've covered them for sure and uh as we come, back around it's, some of sometimes these foundational teachings that you've done over the years are so essential that we get deeper levels of what seems you know you're calling it um what are you calling grammar school level but it's really it's, very basic but it's it has the potential of Greater depth and greater yeah, so I just wanted to, say that because not to dismiss to dismiss the, the, so-called grammar school level, so kindergarten short because if we line it properly there we can go all the way to the university yes, yeah you have to learn proper study habits even in kindergarten is the beginning right sure uh, those proper habits bring you all the way through to the university plus that's kind of thing like that exactly yeah thank you oh thank you all right ah so not much interest in the design of creation the design will show up through some of the other pieces like the uh Center Circle, um uh um uh or concentric whatever uh so because it's there let's say the self will be touched by that or might well I don't know how to word it used let's say there's a circle the center, the circle as part of the construct the cell might want to use that to facilitate its moving from that level of self to the next level of itself it might use a circle the center, of the circle, the center, of the circle and, now sense of being in the next dimension of it next level of it who am I now or self-experiencing itself now and hanging out there for a bit so uh so the ways that the construct work are not just construct pieces but the other pieces are, are affected by this earlier design of creation but I sort of say that I'm most intelligently I don't know Sensei if I could chime in one more time on, what you were just mentioning when we're when we're talking about design we're also talking about the uh in, a way the underlying principles of the universe and I think both you and I know Sensei have often talked about Aikido as being the practice of principles so in a way we're practicing the design of creation that is the design of the universe in the ways that we can feel it embody it in our own being you know feeling the, flows of the of what we might call the Yin and Yang or as you call it sometimes the great he and great she but those flows of the of the pairs of energies in the in the universe we're practicing that in a very practical way and I, love that Aikido gives us that um that the dojo of uh you know and having the place to actually experiment with those in a in and through the body not just the cognitive development which is important but, in the you know feeling the energies, um as you reference so often experience how experi how important it is to, pair yeah the experience that you have in that diagram uh or a pair awareness with experience you're outing for Aikido Dojo, aikido right now is that is that what you just said yeah in a sense I am I'm saying that it's fortunate that we have it it's you know my jump it's unfortunate that there's not enough inner well hell yes I would do this there's a lot of outer ain't nowhere near enough inner yeah yes well that's I mean it might hit my fear oh not dogs I'm saying I'm really interested in everything you say on Friday night uh I, think I'd like to do Aikido do Aikido and you're gonna go to some dojo and the dojo is going to say hit him haggar hurt him more controller come on that's my adventure of the day if you're going to do inner damn well do inner, otherwise we're physically training talking about this philosophy there's got to be some more inner work is that yeah no I I'm right with you because I, think that uh given the comparison between awareness and experience or inner work and outer form structure outer form structure is definitely one but by, a long shot and so you pointing us to and, us taking on the inner work I think is very important it's probably important for Humanity too really because there's so much emphasis has been on the external hang on a second Brett I'm sorry on the front porch there's two pieces of newspaper there's two little pieces kitchen wrapping for me see if I can patch them together sorry hope they didn't get rained on no my table's a little way all right it's not windy out down here no yeah this one no there's two little pieces of newspaper yeah one uh there's two more let me thank you yeah somebody where you said right, where this one was yeah that's okay I'll be back directly there no the animals under the animal there's new failure no one's there forget it I'm sorry they're not there they're not there sorry about that but we'll fit in with the conversation that's going on Blue Jays took them pardon Blue Jays probably took them yeah damn the Jays uh anyway it was something I can't paraphrase it I won't do it justice a little comment in the sports page I skim the sports page uh Ironman skimmed but this thing man so I, just pulled that out and coach was talking about a player uh and he says that maybe the player's been on sick leave or something but he was watching some other good players and the coaching this kid's got a good eye he's very intelligent he sees a lot now and I know he saw a lot watching these other Pros now the question is and I don't know what words he use that's why I want to do a piece of paper but it was akin to osin says put it in your body experience it so the coach was saying he saw it I know he's Sharp I know his awareness is great now the question is, he going to be able to internalize it yeah if he doesn't know about this he's got a good eye he's very aware good, good, but is he going to be able to do the next piece internalize experience and actually show that level that he saw through himself that's basically what the little that he said I thought it was kind of cute and when whoever was talking I thought that was a good follow-up sorry I couldn't find the pieces of paper anyway where are we who's on Noah you don't have any interest in the construct of creation thank you well I think it's critical for balanced development that the that the construct gets a turn yeah we think people we think that to continue to move on properly if you're interested in making an attempt to go to the distance kind of thing uh that some sense experience of all the four main parts seems critical okay some sense and some experience with each one, okay, and how they relate to each other and stuff and this kind of thing is heavy duty in what we call the domain so as we uh so in, getting a sense of the four and some experience with the four this is bringing us potentially to the doorway border uh border of the domain where we entered the domain and here's where we fun around with this stuff play with it okay for me it'll say it's interesting for me uh three words it's a library in the domain so a certain amount of knowledge, it's a laboratory you play gee how does this mean piece hang out with this mean peace okay or what whatever you, it's a laboratory you play with things here now it's a gymnasium now there's a critical piece this experiential piece here he said those Earth two tend to be more mental for a lot of folks they'll go awareness with those hurts too so the gymnasium is critical to have the experience Full Experience not awareness about yes I understand the word experience I know what that means it's not experience okay so you got a double dunk with that word, that, double dunk I try to tell you the dumb stories if the bathtub is gold when you get close to it you feel the warmth and you feel the vapor from this from the feet of the bathtub but you're not in the bathtub, but you're not in the bathtub I'm not curly fully soaking there that close to the bathtub is not a full experience we could call that aware of an experience oh I'm aware it's warm and wet but it's not a full experience so I don't know what to say I just keep pushing on that because it's been slighted virtually since the beginning of creation when I say too much awareness and not enough experience so it seems it's an ancient problem Keisha say something about the ancientness of this problem well we're looking at uh aren't we we're looking at the conditions of humanity and uh it's an ancient and modern problem uh and it you know I mean there's, several different ways to, really consider it one has to do with the, the development of our brains and the and the preference that we give to prefrontal Cortex to the thinking what we call the thinking mind but this goes on in finer dimensions where there isn't cortex of brain and we still have the same problem we have the problem in finer astral planes, where it's so fine that to really experience the fullness they can't do it so it had nothing to do with cortex it's an ancient problem before people before Americans with, laptops I was hoping you'd say you'd go back to some earlier Chronicles in the ancient Chinese and say oh yeah those guys bitched about this also and you did it you did it I I'm sorry I let you down there but uh oh God but it's you know I mean it is an ancient problem but it's also a very modern problem and perhaps even more these days that we were talking about when we were talking about that earlier picture with the small eye the small eye getting pressed in between and Contracting due to the energy of the universe the universe is just trying to give us juice trying to give us aliveness and if we if we hang on to that smaller sense of self that narratives self that, we were talking about Justin and I were talking, about Justin and I were talking about earlier uh that, contraction uh you know I don't know how, far it goes back it goes certainly goes back as far as uh ancient times but it it's, always connected with the thinking mind and the sense of isolation okay one second I gotta turn my heater off it's too noisy thank you oh okay all right construct design so let's say one other thing that you mentioned a lot relative to these is that, people tend to have preferences maybe toward one or another yeah two or another and it's important to recognize that and then try to balance them out by giving the others a turn yes, very good, so I might have mentioned it before uh well we not a week I follow all sensei's numbering system here uh in that system one and two are character and self okay three and four are space and construct okay, I first majored in character self of course there's a little room and all of that Jack water loves construct and space okay so he's practicing with the one two the more character kind of thing I am getting more familiar with the bigger space design of things, to make sure that I'm well-rounded here so, yeah uh I don't know what the percentage of people is who are quote Jack style as opposed to my style of Sensei style whatever, I haven't the floggies or the percentages you want to say anything about anything there but yeah what you said yeah seems so, essential even in reincarnation that probably happens if you're male after male after male playing The Reincarnation game eventually sure as hell are you going to do a female life you you've gotta get more balance there and vice versa okay I don't know if that means anything but just as a dumb example uh I haven't always been male as Macho as I am I don't know I just happen to have bumped into one that was very nice um the creation is set up seems to uh it doesn't like unbalance it will make an effort to show ballots uh in that rebalancing can be a lot of Tremors uh so kind of know that when you go from let's say uh Dimension to Dimension or a one by one to a two by two keep the game simple uh that there could be some something akin to Tremors as you let go of your comfortable safe one by one and move into a two by two or a three by three whatever uh that there could be a little shake up there yeah anyway just little things uh I always know that potentially going to be more energy be prepared to allow it and experience it uh know there's going to be moments of it's not clear you can't figure out what's happening and you just left this beautiful place where you had it all figured out down path yes you move into the next Dimension and suddenly ah everything you had is forgotten or not there or it's not clear that's why I say easy give it give it time easy let it let it show we sort of mention that again when we said careful of hanging on to your teacher how'd you say that your beliefs uh, of anything's too strongly where the reality will bump you or you bump yourself something happens there which is not necessarily fun it's a contraction shift from majoring in Awareness to beginning to uh attempt to get much more experience with the experienced stuff uh can be quite a shock you know because at first you're hitting it at a heavier level so it looks icky okay the smells shitty it's, here you see easy as you understand how things work after a bit you know this is dimensional here also easy settle open okay with a sense of this is the next finer Dimension this is this is the next finer Dimension this is the underworlds two by two okay so one by one smells shitty looks shitty tastes shitty okay easy deeper, in a two by two underworld easy there's more room we infer the energy the finer that's the law, and they begin to show difference okay that's widely out dumb stories like my snake pit story which is an example of that, burst heavy yeah snakes easy and subtle which legs but easy and subtle snakes but they're kind of smiling at me on the corner of their eye oh the game's a foot easy settle open oh they're not snakes they're spiraling energies oh hey cool so dimensionality in the Underworld but for people who aren't versed in the Underworld aren't versed in how the energies move it's a bit of a shock for a lot of them you know they have trouble sitting still for a moment because the energy start to say hey I'm here and, they freak out they can't sit still alone for a moment they got to put their TV on or quick pick up the phone and call somebody and be careful I've been calling a lot of people not of Southern uh so, I'm all over the place tonight uh save me before I Babble more help out there in the listening world hey Sensei it's Mark here from New Zealand hey can you hear me say it says Mac oh am I not coming through that's my okay now I understand my hearing problem it's Mark it's Mark yeah sorry all right please the floor is yours, um yeah again um you're talking about this awareness and, um experience um and a maybe a few months back you talked about um being natural and not working it so hard so, um I've been playing you know trying to play with that and, one of the problems I had is that as soon as I started to think oh I'm going to be natural, um I was still working it so but, recently, um of sort of something that's been helping me a lot is to um kind of really let go and just actually really enjoy the heck out of what is happening um and that's, I'm hoping I'm sort of on the right path here but it, it removes all the, work because I'm, just enjoying, what's happening it's a bit like um your bath that yeah you talked about the bath and, the hot water with some people I think you could put them in the bath and they still wouldn't experience the bath they would but, if I can sink into the butt and just enjoy the bath then I get so much more out of it and it's been making me feel fantastic really, um so I don't know if I've said anything good there but yeah I think I think we also have to be careful with the words you say to somebody uh oh it's too easy be natural and they don't do anything okay I'm, being natural I, was being natural all afternoon nothing happened it depends what they're doing you know screw up any word yeah and there's no magic words necessarily all those certain words I like you know uh I'll mention eventually uh I like to wear those Sensei uses with me of uh more original I really like that for me it's a it's a very meaningful more original, see I've been working to find her find your Dimensions finder, finder and after a bit enough is enough I don't want to continue with that easy so that phrase right there more original it's meaningful to me yeah we'll bring that around another day uh but yeah sorry I'm just saying sometimes the words help certain people at certain times other times they screw their words up no end uh yeah, you see the actual people say well Jose said keep training and what's on it to another million keep training this inner process keep letting go to it keep whatever, words are right what inner process work so it's not getting a thicker shoulder okay, and, and, even um you know during the Aikido uh in retrospect uh the working a lot of the techniques but um take some time to enjoy what's, going on um take let it happen I don't know ah well there is a power in the system uh so I'm thinking that one sense may be of the naturalness is that same power that pushes us Tighter and Tighter and Tighter potentially that same power has a totally the other side of it easy let it let it let it pull you back so to speak I'm not somebody will screw that away I sat there and nothing pulled me back I and I, spent more than an hour waiting for something to pull me back and nothing pulled me back what, words can people use you know we throw them out there take the one that you catch you can use but I don't know if words could do it perfectly I'm sure somebody historically would have written all the important words down and we'd have a little notebook with those words in it that would be it we'd have it all you know well now we're really getting carried away somebody to finish this evening up here where the hell are we what you got where are you going, okay, Danny, um following on from Matt from New Zealand, um can you hear me yes, um but we've had a lot of flooding here recently okay horrible floods in Auckland yes and yes and I was on the phone to my daughter her house was being flooded the water wasn't inside but it was way steep outside and I wanted to do something so I decided I'm going to rescue my daughter and her children and candy yeah very quickly our formulated This Plane I've got to get in the four-wheel drive I'm going to drive over there I saw myself going up the drive getting them and rescuing them doing it and, the actual feeling was quite heavy in my body I, it was full response bye there was something about the I wanted to do it and I had to be The Rescuer but I've found myself actually on the telephone, once I stopped talking to my daughter and I rang up the fire department and I said hey some people need rescuing from the floods and they said oh where are you and they said yeah we've got a vehicle there we'll take care of it and, the scene the finest that filled my body after that um was so opposite to what I was trying to do and as it turned out they were rescued the fire department came and had a boat but from the moment I made the phone call I felt completely different and I rested, next kind of okay when, one piece of what he's talking about is getting a lot of energies to perform all this work he's going to do but realizing those energies were, coming into a tighter space I believe that's what he said okay and realizing wait that's not right okay so he's recognizing that level and when there's too much energy there okay same way I have to realize when I'm getting ready to kill you I've got a whoa uh I can feel that to a certain level different situation but same kind of flavor yeah and to back off on it and whatever, what whatever totally fit there's one piece of it there you get the energies and, be caught that your skin too, the eye was getting too inflated I gotta do this me, kind of thing yeah anyway interesting yeah no I was experienced ourselves learn more about ourselves to learn little tricks of the trade along the way so you picked up something in the area yeah I, thought it was interesting that we were dealing with water and it was the fire department that did the rescuing the, to the fire and water come together and we have a really in, this case a really good outcome I was going to suggest because you changed prime minister that accounted for the flooding that might have helped uh thank you and thank you thank you and thank you people if you got nothing I can go smoke for a while before Katja finishes with uh making dinner for, me and Brad over here, you got something doesn't say it's, Justin I want to chime in uh maybe it's relevant or not relevant but you if we're talking about the design and construct of creation and the harmony of forces that you've mentioned in the past that, the these forces have specific qualities like power Harmony love intelligence how does that play A Part here or we can table that for some other time I leave that up to you because, I haven't quite figured that out exactly how to say it and I have a sense of it like what you're talking about but I'm not ready to hey it's this way I'm, not there yet so uh but something about some relation between each of the four to for like Words your four main colors or four main qualities there's some, kind of relation that I haven't fine-tuned enough to present but good, catch good catch now leave me alone foreign it's probably slightly off topic but it goes I'm who's speaking please sorry it's Oliver can you hear me great thank you here we go sorry it's Oliver oh Oliver, yes um yes um so a couple of weeks ago I mentioned about, um it's more about the process of tracking or how we do the process so tracking across the different pieces whether the four main pieces or even just in terms of um in outer experience or picking up on some depth and picking up seeing signs seeing signs in different places but they've all got an underlying sort of theme, so something similar happened this week but it's different because the one I mentioned two weeks ago was really spotting depth in different places and then I was seeing it outside realizing I needed it to do some Pro some inner work to process character to be in a new place new situation needs a new character so I was seeing the signs outside and it was directing me inwards this week was interesting because I picked up these signs but they were inner signs it was tracking across an inner space um and different dimensions in the dimensions lighting up sort of sort of body um feeling poor lighting up in response to, some pain or any healing work and, but what I noticed also was there was a experiential quality of it in terms of how I relate more generally with the world so it expanded out but it was again these signs but it was just really interesting because they were inner signs that clicked and connected these pieces to show me a direction to keep going it and it was about aliveness core needing to flow outwards so quickly are you saying uh I think you should social situation, that you're in a social situation and realize whatever you weren't quite comfortable or you weren't quite proper or something yeah it was about needing more depth and a new character that was two weeks ago whereas this time it was more about coordinating to open up and allow the energies to flow out and through so it was more like inner signs but they were all related they were all inner everything so yeah, if, my stories I walk out of my house I say whoa what a straight treat I've been living there for years that tree has been there for years always straight it never went crooked in the years I was there but Sunday one morning said well I said what the hell is that about went back to my sitting room and said hey it was a major on deeper centering exactly, yeah I'm in an elevator it's an old lady many years ago I never was too much interested in old ladies you know they're nice old lady but you know but I was, I'm attracted to her but I came home with just saying what the hell was that about I was on a minor transfixed, went to my sitting room said hey what was that about sat open and got to this ancient female wisdom place that was very fascinating to experience so yeah, so that's what I mean two weeks ago I had these sort of outer signs but this, last week there were something into it the inner was telling me signs there was kind of inner signs revealing something about how I needed to relate showed up inner oh this week yes it was a bit different yeah, and it was about cooler and how my core is being held and not allowed to flow and function and how that affects everything in my relation to the outer yeah, no I think as we get better with all this stuff we'll hear the inner dialogue I like the word we'll hear the inner activity uh the censor is telling me a story I'll repeat the story clearly another day but uh we're just walking down the street and something a bunch of energy was happening, didn't know why just walking down the street uh and then he did something with it whatever and that was the day a bunch of cadets he was teaching wanted to check him out so 15 of them or so jumped up from the alley to surprise him and see what he'd do you know uh kind of thing uh but that this energy was activating when there was no nothing was happening it just was activating so it was certainly the inner saying hey, hey, yeah does that fitting with this yeah exactly it's just a case of mapping as well it was like there were clearly pieces they were they were clearly dimensional it was like four clear pieces four or five clear things showing a sign relating to poor something about core being really significant yeah interesting that it presents all four of the foreign it felt like a shift I don't understand it yet but it felt like a shift something happened so I have to play with it see what's going on well one thing could be if the four are appearing and I would surmise you've been playing with them individually and having some experience with each of the individually in here one day it said they're lining up and I use the word squaring away they're lining up and squaring away very good yeah because as I mentioned earlier I think we need a lined up square away certain amount proper for to really move into this, next big layer of the cake the second layer of the three layer cake kind of thing yeah so cool it's people thinking I'm out of here uh thank you so much without my babbling thank you Cincy thank you sensei okay thank you thank, you sensei okay thank you thank you everybody thank you thank you everyone thank you thank you Lauren thank you everyone good night thank you thanks Lauren hey Danny, can you still hear me yes, I just want to say that while you had this energy up and down the fact is that you had an emergency and you responded with action right your first reaction was not to sit back and consider everything your first response was to act and you know the fact is you did understand your own limitations and thought of a better idea than driving into the flood yourself so you too can become a victim right so you know I'm so glad that your, daughter and her family are safe and uh but I was thank you struck by that you know uh part of the training is also to act when needed it's the response of any good father I tell you to tell you what you know right there yeah, thank you Danny good night, lovely words thank you all very much thank you Danny and let's see we want Brad to join us right we'll be he'll be there he's probably here now there he is so Brad the uh I know maybe Lauren has something for you but um I've just been noticing how blurry the camera is and I'm wondering in the rooting is there a is there a filter boy because that picture right now looks hella better than it did during the during the presentation no I, think it still looks the same do you I can now clearly read I'm getting spotlighted so you can see it better okay actually the, upload bandwidth went up to about 800 now, I don't know if that's a function but right now it looks sharp yeah, because you switched to the other camera please Brad yeah like I said it hit more than doubled I tripled than what was going on during the broadcast it's so amazing yeah, that's clearer too so you're thinking it's bandwidth but I'm what I'm wondering is what don't you have a couple of hubs or something where this where the video signal is rooting through, foreign going uh being uploaded yeah it's us it's USB and then I have a dongle yeah so I've got two parts I've got a multi-usb port it plugs into another dongle and that has the ethernet and then that goes into the laptop that's a USBC because is the is it powered is the dongle or is the uh is that powered it's, powering that's how that's how the cameras are powered as well right yeah and yeah it Powers the laptop and it Powers the cameras I'm, actually I thought it was a camera problem or a routing problem but looking at this right now it's neither it's a bandwidth problem, I, wonder Lauren I, mean it appears to be a bandwidth issue but it's also something about the root the routing it could be something about the routing as well right so, uh Brad if I understand what you just said you have uh going from the computer outward right the computer has a USBC port and then you have an adapter that takes an Ethernet input on RJ45 and uh USB a b or c I don't know which is what the Logitech cameras talk yeah they talk to the usba port which feeds into the USBC dongle, as well as the modem connection yes so and then once you're in the computer they there's no routing at all that's the only routing so yeah and this is especially dongle itself is defective but look at this now TJ it's completely sharp again it's very it's, much sharper right now that's true what I'm thinking of contributing there to you Brad is a uh black magic uh ATM Mini Pro are you familiar with that do you know what that what that Blackmagic is a company that does video stuff and all kinds of things I invite you to look it up it's called ATM atem ATM atem Mini Pro and I think I'm gonna I've got two of them I'm gonna send one down to you okay because it also has are you connected with ethernet there at the house it's a DSL connection it's a DSL connection so it's but it comes in over the actual provider is Comcast is that right no it's a t fiber optics no that would be DSL over copper yeah that's right so uh um the, FI we are we ought to see because they're, fiber optics is a thousand up thousand down guaranteed all the time and um and it, doesn't go up and down the same way that the that the uh Comcast does and it was when I changed over from Comcast to a t it was one-third the price of Comcast well so I think that uh you're right that a fundamental solution to the problem would be to upgrade their, internet service yeah right so um it could be cheaper you live there in there so at T certainly has a higher bandwidth, Services uh I'm I would imagine that Comcast is running down the street as well, uh and you know yeah there's got their television, uh I don't know I could I could ask but yeah there's four isps in San Mateo and I think it kind of depends on the neighborhood but I mean you've got Comcast yeah there's Oakland the other one we have besides a t and Comcast is sonic yeah sonic is essentially used a t is using Sonic or sonic is using a t at least over here I'm a t but the, fiber optic I think could really manage some of the bandwidth problems yeah, it could be cheaper you know probably yeah broad a broadband connection would be much better than DSL I think Broadband would be I think it's more stable than DSL so it's weird because this is the same setup we've been doing for two and a half years yep and like it's I noticed it last week like I said the, upload bandwidth has been about 850 to a thousand consistently to the point I just stopped checking it but until last week and then same thing happened like for the, rehearsal it was fine and then once everybody logged on the bandwidth is like at 350 and then that's when you were saying the picture's fuzzy and so it's like the same thing happened tonight where again it was pretty much a 350 upload consistently the download was fast like it's always been a thousand to fifteen hundred fine um but then yeah tonight it dropped down again and so I don't know if there's more traffic did somebody move in down the street that's watching Netflix you know I don't know but that's absolutely right, exactly right yeah so [Music], um, yeah the outlet speed's just a little slow is that Katya right there yeah that's right here yeah can you join us but I noticed we have really problems with our internet and uh it's getting very slow especially evening and then the later in the evening gets worse and I think I have to go to ATT and order for a different kind of service maybe we switch over to fiber yeah exactly and it'll be cheaper kacha the satisha hey Keisha yeah it'll be cheaper uh and it's better service uh and then you could get a you'll have you'll have also you'll have uh ethernet coming out of there and with the device I I'm gonna give you give you Brad it's very easy to set up it's very it's super intuitive and um you'll have a, direct line that'll it'll connect the ethernet the cameras with the ethernet and so for your upload to uh the YouTube and so on it'll be awesome we're, still recording I think we are so yes uh you stopped that so uh, actually so Katya if you would explore that and if it if it is cheaper at higher bandwidth in your old system great and if it isn't would you still go ahead and we'll subsidize the difference yes because uh tonight you know for much of the recording much of the sessions uh Sensei and the easel were blurred because of the bandwidth it now appears it needs to be addressed I mean I noticed sometimes I'm going to read something in the evening and I cannot upload things anymore and then especially uh at the later evening the worst it gets I don't know yeah so upload's always less than download, speeds and um DSL is you know very stable mature is a polite way to say yes you know that I started my career they were introducing DSL and I'm retired now okay well I guess we retire our DSL too so I will go to will go to um I will go to My ATT and see what they can offer me or I'll call them all right so if, not there might as Brad said there's Alternatives but since you at T already has your account maybe they'll give you a deal okay yeah rather than leave them yeah but uh whatever it costs if it's turns out to be more than what you're paying now will subsidize that all right well let's see but where it goes um we have a home phone we don't need any more so we can drop the we can drop the home phone and then I think yeah, how do you get your television to catch up, to internet to yeah if you have only internet we have uh service only streaming and no, basic cable we don't have cable no, uh local television, no, do you have an antenna you don't have enough time now well you might be able to get local TV over an antenna but yeah probably talks about it that's um because I was going to say that Comcast has a pretty good Triple Play I used it for a long time okay but if you're very expensive you could go to my food and make sure that's not don't stir the pot okay that's it yeah okay thanks Brad I'm gonna sign off but we're going to look into that fiber optic thing that's really the way to go yeah for over two years two and a half years it's been Flawless great it's been like not a not a minute in com the Comcast that I had before then was these kinds of problems daily yeah, I'm actually switching over to Sonic um, so a quick question to you so that, fiber optic that ethernet thing you're saying do we need additional cables or should we do we need to meet or what else do we need for it it'll, be uh from your camera it'll just be a um an HDMI or you know it's a USB cameras currently cameras only talk USB is that correct yeah that's fine but there is a USB to, HDMI there's an adapter I'll make sure I'll make sure that you have the right stuff okay, so the, atem mini talks uh inputs or what yeah right HDMI but it also talks in and out with um with uh USB and USB 3 and, and, and, Thunderbolt if you have it on your computer right so, that if it has two USB ports then we can connect the two existing cameras, now it's got more than enough uh just check it out go up onto Blackmagic design look up atem and a Mini Pro and you'll see what it is it has the as they went out I'll send you I'll send you one of the two that I have okay so and that's ATM mini pro Blackmagic atem it's called atem mini yeah so you'll see it when you go Blackmagic design they're a fabulous uh company from Australia the mini pro yes atem mini pro A10 right, HDMI input webcam out four standards kind of HDMI out fairlight audio out DVI blah, blah, yeah wonderful it's going to be very cool it'll be very cool it'll, uh it'll make your life easier Brad it's not, going to be more complicated very stable okay yeah cool okay go have dinner thank you Brad thank you good night good night TJ good night Lauren gotcha says good night

## Presence: Here and Now!

**Date:** Unknown date  
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3xnHHUl6FM

presence refers to the ability to project a sense of ease poise or self-assurance especially the quality or manner of a person's bearing before an audience like the actor had a good deal of stage presence, but nado sensei talks about character personal appearance or bearing especially of a dignified or imposing kind, a person of fine presence now sensei will certainly talk about how osensei had such a fine presence such an impression that people got a person especially of noteworthy appearance or compelling personality he or she has a real presence even at a private party and then last definition in the dictionary was a divine or supernatural spirit felt to be presence as in he felt a presence with him in the room so these are just uh dictionary definitions and uh you can literally file them away but we're going to uh use this as the slate when as people arrive here for the next few minutes until uh sensei is uh is ready so uh anybody wanna talk about this or uh what is it uh somebody voted for number nine okay a supernatural or divine spirit got a few minutes to kick this around lauren i think in some ways as a basic, would be number one just the fact of being present yeah and it's, right from the, actual word and it's yeah you know at this time right now so some of the ones you were talking about i think if somebody was, very good and effective at being present then some of the other things you were talking about with the definitions further down would come out of that right, this is just how people use the word but i completely agree with you bob anybody else want to chime in while we wait 25 people logged in this is sassoon um there is there is something around there about being presence in embodiment of the moment, presence, be us being human involves being the difference of some people's idea of present mentally as opposed to embodying the moment is an important difference as they'll keep saying it's an experience not, mental yeah for sure and uh yeah embodying is a really alternate good alternate word right, so i'm sure nado sensei will emphasize that it's not enough to be aware of this concept, if you have to actually do it to me personally you know you know coming from an academic background aikido, offered me a chance or a challenge literally to take all those concepts and actually do it right in real time in three-dimensional or four-dimensional space and uh you know you know no time to think about the concept of doing it you when you're in the moment so, it's really ties together doesn't it yes i like the um, embodiment of the moment cool anybody else have a free a favorite phrase well i might contribute something um, we're talking about the moment and time in a way presence is out of time or in other words it's not in the aspect of linear time you know not this moment that moment that moment it is it is the timeless now and i, mean that you know not to for it hopefully it doesn't sound trite but the but the, timelessness aspect of it i think is very important uh in the subject, as uh sensei will bring up tonight just wanted to uh well very inscrutable roshi so, there's something going on here about time i think we can all agree and, there's something going on about body because even the dictionary has in it in it a concept or a articulation of place that you can't be present without, including, both time both time and place and place right you can't be present nowhere and you can't be present no time no time so it has to do with time and it has to do with place and you know uh you know when i was uh a youngster i read be here now and you know few, authors have made as good a title as that uh, and, so that doesn't say when we talked about the theme for today he talked about dimensionality here and now, and presence here and now and, how that ties to easy the eye which i suspect ties to the embodiment aspect as well as to the timelessness of now of now so i think that uh sensei is about ready and uh that's enough for me yes and thank you sensei you're on i don't see me yet sorry here we go there he is this is not an april fool's joke it's my it's my program maybe it is an april fool's joke anyway good evening how are you ah good evening, are you present okay uh where are we tonight presents here and now i'm liking the word positioning uh, a lot a lot [Music] tonight okay ah but let's chat for a moment anything from last week before we get into this let's, ah, let's settle anything nagging on you insights of the week hello out there nothing out of here that says one thing that stuck with me from last week was that we did some dimensional practices, with building the center in the sense that we that we started wherever we were starting from but then you led us through i think three or four rounds of dimensional practice to get fuller and more complete and i like that okay, yeah i kind of i think i think are basic there yeah no a basic hour basic okay what should we do here presents, i, think this awareness work uh, studying the finer workings of creation there's a lot of possibilities of majoring in mental or aware of it [Music] but a very important other piece there is the experience of it okay, um, see we lay out on friday nights a lot of diagrams a lot of concepts but it's up to you to go okay that caught my attention and to sit with it or stand with it whatever form you're doing experience it then settling easy opening to get to a finer level of experiencing it okay so that part is very important so i'll keep reminding you do something with it tnt from new zealand um one of the real one of the, key points that stood out for me last week was the um the use of the word terrain which should again for me gave that sort of situation gave it that sort of more texture it gave it an experience of its own which helped me bring my center the terrain gave it more uh guess depth more um is those things terrain the lay of the land yeah the dimensional floor yeah okay go ahead so, it gave that sort of depth so when i when i when the balance was happening between the center and the terrain that sort of gave it more i guess depth is more the word but gave it more grunt i guess because it had its own character there's two characters sort of coming together had its own um or terrain or terrain hit something more than just a situation yeah so really gave me something could we say also we use the two forces coming together the energies of the center acknowledge the energies of the circle the energies of the circle retort back and the, mixing of those two is where i get a character yeah better on the center the plant you character, yeah, yeah i liked it that's great thank you and it gives you a what's the word direction settle down it's a little bit deeper, uh you can't go wrong with that because uh our spiritual history is up heaven is up there okay, and, that was good in that up their approach many of those beings people many of those people got into finer dimensions on the upward track, easier through the awareness form to get into finer dimensions but now i think i think what would say that we've not overdone it but enough now let's go back to what used to be acknowledged at a certain level uh in the days of uh i don't know uh ground contact uh the old ladies who had good ground contact who were lady later burned as witches unfortunately uh, so we came out of that started to major in this more awareness of finer dimensions okay i kind of think it's time now though to go back to this other half that we've uh not paid attention to really for low these many hundreds of years however long it's been is that did i say that okay did that catch anybody, yeah, i think just that is an interesting topic, um how were those people i don't know when 1400 whatever experiencing the ground experiencing their presence on what they call the first level earth uh, what their what their sense of, uh the maybe finer levels the leprechauns that were there the forest fairies that were there whatever how did some of the more sensitive ground people uh pick up on those things uh just for fun not nothing we have to do but it's somebody trying to talk they're just beating on their microphone what are you doing out there talking am i talking to you your voice is muffled okay sorry, i'll, get that speak up sean speak up speak up sean speak up okay so i remember um hearing how in like around the 1400s a uh shoemaker could look at a cart of leather, and, instantly give the guy a price on the leather because he knew just by looking at it having a sense how many shoes that could make or how many vests that could make or whatever he was and, just about any trades person could look at the raw goods, and have a and have a uh innate sense of what it's worth yeah, so again i think the critical word there was in a sense yes that something that just a viewer may not have so they're the ones you got to measure that for me you've got to weigh it uh i have to double check and make sure i can make 20 pairs of shoes out of that, there's a certain level where they were sensing things a bit different it sounds like you're saying yeah, yeah no calculations required it was a knack yeah, okay anyway so what are we going to hear tonight uh the oh god damn okay easy the eye now let's use this one here uh, something like the uh early increase the beginnings of creation uh went out and back but it also uh went into heavier okay and okay and we got caught up in that heavier so we ended up here uh, as a human being and some heavier than others or and we sort of got stuck i'm a human being this is all that is i'm a bobby there's nothing more ah so the eye has locked into that level so easy the eye [Applause] type of letting go easy, the eye let go of what you're hanging on to easy, easy [Music], in that letting go easy there's a sense of, for me opening for me right now that's just a little more room it just feels like my rib cage opened a bit, there's more room it feels like i'm breathing a little fuller easy the eye easy okay now it's getting anxious but what, what where, am i going what am i looking for hush i see easy the eye easy it's okay easy [Music] i could say enjoy the rest here easy it's okay easy the eye yeah again that feeling of more room circular um soft sense of deeper yeah, any little anxiety building up you see it's okay so why don't people continue on easy the eye to find her the finer and finer and funnier and finer and finer because like i just experienced they feel that anxiety and they believe it uh they don't know what to do with it and so they freeze there or go back into upper where there wasn't that anxiety, okay, so easy the eye easy the eye don't know where i'm going yet but anything on easy the eye when you ease the eye what, happens easy the eye what is your experience of easing the eye sensei bob again one thing you also mentioned last week was that little patch of dark and when the eye touches that dark if you know what it is you can use it to get even easier if you don't know what it is then you clam up you're gonna yeah you're gonna stop right there uh you're probably going to either stop there, at that level or you're even going to climb up a little higher to stay away from the dark and the little name names that you may censor there uh we'll talk about the dark after a bit but yeah but yeah the dark again is something that happens when you go from oh let's say let's say a major dimension jumps when you go from wherever to the next level might bump into some dark you may not catch it at first it's dark it just may be, an emptiness or it may be gee i don't know what's going on what's happening where am i [Applause] why am i why am i uh but after a bit you begin to quite likely pick up that same gap, moving from level to level, to level has a type of dark downtime dark okay so if you don't experience dark at the first uh weird bobby to bobby to robert to mr robert to a better robert uh it's okay but there is a little gap there a little something if you're really fine too you can pick it up let me give you a dumb example you're doing right now at this level settling and it's meant smaller level this level and then easy to the next level okay for me it's good quiet and empty it's like there's nothing there's nothing on my screen so to speak empty, okay so see i wouldn't call that empty a dark but that's probably what it's related to as i continue i continue then i'll run into dark as the go-between trick, go between happening are we diverging onto something else here am i am i losing me and you if i may i want to concur what uh noah said and then uh, also just in i think more directly in relationship to your question or, directly related to your question easily the eye allows you to begin to let go of that sense of identity that you were talking about yeah your, run by your one by your two by uh whatever um example we're using there yeah so that, that starts to let go you start to uh be, comfortable with as you rest into the presence of that transition that you're that you're in so it's exactly as bob was saying as noah was saying it's just a little different approach in language yeah so again in a transition to another level or dimension whatever you want to call that is something that you're passing through or will notice that we call the dark the dark okay but again i'm just trying to present you may not notice it at first it's dark it just may be on i don't know or unclarity or nothing seems to be going on here kind of thing uh, but there is a transitional membrane transitional border that you all pass through you might have all kinds of different words for it but if you're really fine-tuned you you'll, pick it up yeah, and on the fine on the fine side it is that it is that letting go there is a i think there's a even a kind of purposeful or conscious letting go yeah, the dumb example of bread the dumb example i used to use a bit i thought was kind of classical human being remove this glass from spilling breath, [Music], other, [Music] i would present in class as an example uh, you're really pissed off at that guy yeah come on come on come on easy seven we don't get another on the show easy, he's easy, you begin to breathe you begin to settle a bit and then soon you'll go you're right why am i worried about that about that and he'll stop wanting to punch him out and he'll walk away and discuss maybe but he's changed levels so that's all i've been trying to do and that's what you do with your buddy when he wants to go punch somebody out and say oh wait a minute no don't, worry about no it's okay man come on come on it's okay, thank you, want to overplay and to let you know i'm up on current events we needed uh such a person at the uh hollywood thing oscars the oscars the oscars, the oscars the oscars just to let you know i'm up on things [Music], i pay attention to what's going on out there where the hell are we i'm all over the place tonight huh ah so ah so easy the eye easy they are easy the eye easy they are easy the eye uh the eye is ongoing the words the word will change and will at a certain level call it a self so i smaller yeah i portrayed the words i made an eye next level's an eye next one probably an eye easy the eye that easy soon eventually around the fourth level arbitrary, around the fourth level uh let's say we're doing a one by two by three buy after the three by ease of the eye the good possibility some of you say wait this, little has a bigger sense to it self, self is that okay then we add things to it like a finer self to continue moving along through levels later i'll add on even another word there but not, tonight but you see that huh, it's ongoing uh self and fancy self-advanced self-finer of self uh eventually is your original consciousness so, i is booked into this a fantastically big piece of creation, consciousness your consciousness okay and as we eat through the eye you're heading back potentially towards that okay, uh but at first we're going through a fair amount of heaviness and the heaviness gets lighter and lighter and lighter the energies will show finer and finer vibration rates okay, but these first human levels can be really heavy that guy's an animal and you mean it he's an animal you know so we unwind the heavy the heavy covering see here it's heavier as you continue it's finer as you continue it's thread light it's not heavy, hauser, h-a-w-s-e-r yeah uh so as we ease the eye we're entwining unwinding the heaviness is unwinding as we do that easy there's no winding going on and the unwinding is an opening in the opening is a finer sense of things in that finer space is a finer center plant character ah and that's our map okay i said a lot in that long sentence where are we eating the eye self eventually a more original self eventually uh more original consciousness itself fancy cnc christian from new zealand again the um my initial um sort of relaxing as we start to get present is that you always described as the uh running the company and you're relieved not to be running the company it's a family that's saying so i always have it saying running the company okay, all your words for me for me sure i haven't learned your language yet sorry i always have the experience of um relief which reminds me of your saying that, it's uh it's uh you know the son that has to run the family business and doesn't then realize that he doesn't have to run that business there's a when an eye starts to relax, it's relief almost shifting into that space oh yeah that's nice yeah, if it's not his job if he's not that kind of plant doesn't matter if mommies are rose and daddy's a rose and uncle jose rose if you're not a rose you probably don't want to get involved in the family business okay so when you realize you don't have to, or they realize you can't and they say go ye and do your own thing son oh thank god yeah because you're hanging onto something that is horrible really wasn't you yeah something like that yeah, that and that initial feelings that's that when that, becoming present it's like oh yeah that's it it's a giant relief to start moving into that space and following that pattern of uh, i don't know the essential you um a lot of people don't know who, they are they're not sure they're doing certain jobs and they're sort of successful but they're not sure um, you probably won't be able to figure it out at the level you're at ease of the eye and open because the energies of the circle and therefore the energy's better moving up and down the center character plant at better levels there that's you and they'll be clear what you should do kind of thing so i know a lot of people have had that question and they're not sure if they're if their uh job or if they're on the right mission that's too big a word for me here if they're doing the right job uh, i don't know if you'll be able to figure it out my family was a little perturbed when i left the police force because my working-class family man you got a guaranteed job you got retirement you got all this uh it wasn't me it was a lark i'm not a cop, you know you know uh it was interesting at the times i learned some streetsy stuff and all learned a bit about people a certain way but it wasn't me if i took an interest test uh i would just average out on that i'd be if you had an average score uh for people that probably aren't cops i was at that level it wasn't me so it was easy for me to let go of it but some of the older family members were like why'd you do that was that a smart move anyway as you settle and open trust the energies of the system you're in of the uh potted plant you're in that your nutrients are there you're in your potted plant and as you settle and open and get to finer levels of soil nutrients that along with this and this along with that, things ought to clarify more and more potentially things will be offered to you did i say that oh okay janet it was great thank you i'm on a bit of a tangent about an instant i uh okay so easy the eye is important as we do that be prepared for at these different, floors, levels dimensions whatever word is comfortable for you but you have to sense of that it's a finer vibratory space okay that there's a certain pattern or positioning, that in the finer space there is the center and there is the circle there is a terrain vib breeding at a certain and there is the character okay, all right and you want to continue with that what might throw that off and when it goes finer you continue with that same pattern so you've got an ongoing pattern you don't lose your positioning uh finer and finer and finer towards this eventual origin this eventual [Applause], source, with the capital s we're heading back to the more original is the long range journey hopefully the long range journey okay ah that you've got an ongoing pattern that will properly line you up to that one thing that throws us is often you hit a finer level and it and it's humming so fine it's vibing so fine, uh it's wow it's bright it's beautiful it's whatever just the sentiment of the new sense wow and because of that wow i think there's a tendency of wow and forget wait a minute yes this is the terrain, now, let me experience the center now terrain and center and who's the character, there's a character at that level [Music], okay, that might be one reason why we lose a good pattern whether it's the addition sign pattern you remember him okay there he is uh the audition sign pack right could you for me the addition sign pattern uh might be i i'm, thinking a lot of the awareness when you first move into a better dimension at first you're aware as you hang out you're aware and you're feeling a bit therefore you think you're experiencing not good enough for me but you feel the, something from it and you call that experience not yet okay, we need much more of a deeper fuller center okay now that begins to be the experience actually okay anyway i think i'm just saying that the wow factor because it's finer or more beautiful or brighter or bigger or whatever, uh that for some reason people seem to forget, the pattern so establish your pattern very early in the game as soon as you stand up establish your pattern okay in fact let's do one for a moment [Music] the beginning of doing something okay first be present okay now i know i'm here okay fine now the beginnings of feeling here i'm feeling more, more of my body being present for example i'm noticing almost a balance between my left and right sides it's not fantastic but it is trying to balance i can feel that sense feel that i feel my, feet more fully touching the floor the floor i got flat feet that may make it easier ah okay, so positioning in that first level here and now positioning okay, and, positioning at this level there's a certain amount of circle here easy trying to trying to sense feel it there's a circle here okay in the middle of this body there's a center, two center rod center, center two center rod center something, there's the center this feels like a bobby level no i'm past that robert level at least for robert level if i had to use the one by two by three but it's not a one buy that guy's right here uh two buy two bucks not a three buy buddy in the vicinity of two by ah, so my so my character is a two-by or a robber there's a center and there is a circle energies move out and in or in and out and this comes more alive everything here comes more alive shows the more aliveness of itself okay so there's a pretty good uh construct with our word tonight positioning is a good position positioning is a good position now, if i were to go finer, finer, inner finer dimensional inner final dimensional i want to retain that, positioning that makeup center circle, character, okay it goes out and it comes in i hope i said something intelligent ah camera thank you oh bye i'm bouncing around a bit did you get anything out of that brad did you get any of it yeah so my, question then is um so there's circle-centered character so then so there's presence with that back into the theme yeah, you're okay now be good be careful the words present with that could be i'm aware of that i see that and that's not good enough for me that's the awareness of it are you breathing it are you feeling it is your body actually straightening up is there a feeling of a little fuller okay not an idea about it not a picture up here about it now we're into the experience of it i'm not anti-imaging or pictures or knowledge believe it or not i'm saying yes great but that's half and what pisses me off is when people try to make that everything because that's such a good image of things and they're feeling a little bump up from it and so they aren't centered circle people are centered but they're not heavy duty centered okay so circle people have to learn to work this work this center a bit better and centered majors me and oh sensei centered majors uh have to catch on to oh how the circle works, okay oh since i had a sense of it when he was working strongly on his center he was aware of it, was showing a bit of course, but he didn't know the full extent of it the fullness of circle okay that's where de gucci came into the picture because sensei by that time had a damn good center and again was aware of a certain amount of circle activity but not to the degree of circle equal to the center and center improving better the circle better the center finer the dimension moving along towards a source for finer and finer and finer did i say anything clearly oh brad did we get it to get to your comment question yeah what was your question well they're saying her presence ties in so maybe if we're more present then the circle the center and the character they show it's easier it's clearer yeah i would say you you'll move through well here let's lose this guy uh, so that's what we did we did this yeah we, did this red guy a minute ago okay and we had a sort of a fullness with them right now as you're moving to the next dimension, the next level then there then there that, made up this guy will make up that, being it's that grouping now after a bit it won't be a physical body it'll be an energy body it'll be a, field body okay so you can't keep hanging on the physical body because as you get finer and trying to find her it's your past heavy physical vibrations you're into finer vibrations you sense okay, physical field finer and finer you sense feel, finer than that you're sensing all of this, okay a type of feeling but it's a sense very fine sense feeling we mapped that out once out once on a friday night and on and on and on where the hell am i where are you where are we sensei this is lauren i wonder if you could explain why the, diagram in the lower right is, yes why yes why depending upon how you look at it it's either opening or closing and that is it's, it's not it's not it's not two parallel lines but they're broader at the bottom than they are at the top that, infers the finer that infers this, is the same thing it's just how you want to look at it okay so broader infers you're moving into finer territory when i sit and i start here let's say and i go through a long process of click, click, click i'm going through that okay hopefully on a good session i get to this level is that, okay same thing here i start here now if i do a good job i go click, click, and get to a finer watch out for the sense of bigger it'll be a sense of bigger but don't go into bigger you'll get lost okay uh keep your uh grouping, keep your keep your centered circle uh within reason okay anyway uh lauren that's the same as that it's just a different angle on it if i need a new word help me with a different word no thank you that helps a lot yeah you see i, don't know what the accident was exactly but in the beginning of the layout of creation, let me say it simply as i can right now your consciousness you were aware and you were experiencing yourself just as consciousness i call that the piece of glass i might have called it saran wrap okay, clear now you get a creation boom bang and it creates very fine vibes and lesser fine vibes and heavier vibes all the way to heavier matter okay, somehow or other we lost touch we didn't hold ourselves as the fullness of self consciousness whatever uh and we spun a bit, and we spun into that, tighter, now i'm in the human condition okay, if we could i make a joke if, we could have spun tighter we would have ended up being rocks a joke that's not really a joke so we're stuck here in this tight place okay believing this is it if we unwind and open and settle and do a proper process the reality of the finer of things will show, and the reality of a more original potential this is big time the original of this the beginnings of creation the source of creation since they called it one he liked the word source uh that's a potential but that's the goal post i call it also goal post yeah that's a goal post now forget about it, we're on the whatever yard line let's do our best at here so we can move on to the next whatever yard line so let's not talk about goal posts as if we're going to be there tomorrow uh or in the next three minutes uh goal post is yeah eventually people eventually but let's do a proper, proper, to facilitate our travel whatever the word is to that level all i can say is one click is better than none than none okay a robert is so much better than weird bobby anna doe is really so much better than weird bobby so, even those moves that we're doing in the manifest sort of represents a heavier of creation but as we move, move we get into the lighter parts of it those are worth doing as a human being you want to stay in your i don't think so you kind of know it should be better you have a sense of it should be better that's the self trying to call out to you hey it's better but you gotta let go of that and return back to yourself okay i think i just gave you the whole layout of creation in uh has something was that you lauren did i answer anything for you then you, did sensei very much so and uh i as i, hear you today talk um about uh about uh letting go of the tight self the you know the, part that says uh walks down the street saying this is who i am this is what i do this is who i am this is what i do you know i personally you know we talk about these uh exercises and as a travel vehicles but, you know as you know i, like you i traveled to japan as a young man and one of the things i believe happened to me living in a foreign country is that i let go of my self-image of myself yes which was a combination of my parents expectations of me right and my own like uh oh this is what i like to eat yeah, yeah that's why let me jump in online if i forget uh so i tell the story sometimes of, uh i moved from back east to redwood city california, so i went to high school in redwood city california, i did some work for a little bit and i joined the police force redwood city california, got my paycheck from the city of redwood city california now finally i get on the ship to go to japan, okay and i'm already starting to let go of being a cop and all of that uh and let go of living in redwood city but it really hits me when people would say where are you from and i would say redwood city and they'd go where and even some of them are from all over the world i'd say california and they'd say where so redwood city was my everything and suddenly to realize it wasn't to other people i'm sure i'm sure if i had said redwood city in japan the japanese guru went what where huh doesn't mean anything that, meant so much to me so yes i'm agreeing with what he said yeah and so and so and so the, the travel vehicles we talk about them as travel vehicles to other dimensions and i think it shares exactly this idea of letting go of your self-image of your self-expectation or what you think you are or who you think you are in order to, experience the life in a foreign country or life in another dimension so thank you sensei, um, yeah one of my early insights was realizing, uh because i was doing a type of whatever letting go i was doing back in the day uh that i really didn't know i realized i didn't know who i was so i came to terms with it okay this is who i'll be today but i really don't know who i am so tomorrow when i do we'll see who i am then but i knew not to lock in on my experience of the day even though i was in a meditation format not to lock in on it because i really didn't more fully know who i was so i was prepared to let go of that one easy easily effortlessly to move into the next one and not glom on to that one either okay, yeah so that, so that's what i called uh not knowing who i was and being okay with it because there'd be something a bit better, i you know let go bobby so robert will be there let go of robert nadeau's there let go of him and whoa start to get fancy, mr energy awareness guy is here boom, and on and on and on so that doesn't get it should get easier for you okay should get easier for you as you progress a little bit you know the first few are i'll take your time there and go through those but once you get the sense of click, click uh you're beginning to be on your way continue the click but it should be finer and easier and whatever and better and all of that stuff okay it can't get worse okay, not really not really uh it might bump into something you don't understand and it confuses you or something but, by law it can only be finer it's the vibrational law okay so it doesn't go from thick, to lighter and lighter and lighter it's only thick again it doesn't work that way, okay help me here uh where are we positioning internal positioning perhaps sensei you can go back to the word, that we started with tonight which is presence here and now okay, presents here and now could i use the word properly okay feel yourself acknowledge center in a circle acknowledge your character or there's a character there okay then when you dimensionally move, into a finer level easy the eye facilitates easy let go of that easy you're a new terrain at first you it's not clear remember when you move from a two by into a three by uh the three by wasn't instantly clear and there you were okay uh i believe for a lot of you there's probably an emptiness nothing really showing it's easy it's okay you're someplace don't panic and then after a little bit oh, there's a center here oh, there's a circle oh they're kind of energy vibrations or nutrients uh oh, ah oh, ah i feel better here oh i'm a three by three trying to facilitate the movement properly, properly, okay if you just do awareness into finer, you can see more but after a bit it's going to you won't be able to see finer, so that may stop you okay, you need its partner aware experience experiencing aware you need both of those you want to call them center and circle you need both of those okay i like kind of an idea experience, okay, i try to show you the dumb stuff over and over because within the double simple stuff is good basics i have an idea i would like to stand better whatever standing better means, i would like to stand better okay, now i have enough experience enough i try to stand better with my idea i ain't going to make it i wasn't really making that up that was for true i'd like to stand better now it's partner it's counterpart underworld mixes nutrients oh they're alive and they're moving up and down all around especially inner and wait and i'm picking the beat and this there we go so i just showed you an idea to its partner and to do it properly that should be a very simple kindergarten practice but important because it's its basics are true and will forever be true, all right but i know i know the world is more beautiful that's nice let the world at that beautiful level show itself let the energy show let it uh, nutrient show let the commie show let the schmooze show okay and make sure you're inhaling them if you would make sure you have a centered character there okay and that one will move beautifully its voice will be beautiful its presence will be beautiful because this is inner reality that's manifesting out so strong even the neighbors pick it up unless they're real dumb people can really be thick and you can have somebody who's really kind of whatever the internal finer glowing and they won't pick it up i'm sure a lot of people in christ walk down the street said who the hell is that and somebody said that's the carpenter's kid oh yeah okay others were whoa who's that okay it's in the eye of the beholder the heavies have trouble sensing these finer things don't expect too much from them sometimes they don't have eyes to see if your finer vibrant vibration mix yourself you'll, pick that up a bit better bit better and the finer ones will catch oh that's a finer one oh yeah all right all right is that a good example or a repeat example so these inner finer dimensions [Applause] have a particular grouping center circle character or we'll call it a potted plant it's a finer pot okay, let's call it a little bit bigger pot and in the bigger pot is more soil and in the more soil are more better nutrients, okay and the plant takes advantage of those nutrients and becomes a better plant character okay a guy who's more comfortable in his world, a guy who's more natural in his world okay, night you know time to try to present that is if you're more centered uh the activity that's going around you you'll be able to cope with it smoother and whatever now instead of doing the internal work i said let me go out there and see how to do it smoother no, no, son of a not out there doing it smoother get smoother in here and see how mr in here wants to do that not now i'm going to go out there and do it smoother you just misunderstood something, okay is that kind of clear anyway i was just talking to brad before session and saying you know we have to try to stretch that out in, class we're a little clearer on the inner and then, some of the outer and a little clearer on the inner and then a couple of minutes with the outer but back to the inner so that the distinction may be the clarity of how it works inner manifest better outer i'm sorry i can't say it any better [Music], i know it's the same thing i've been saying since forever but we forget we have to be reminded to move on because some people are a little bit we'll get to a nice place and stop there it's like yeah but if you're interested there's nicer than nice let's continue if you have a mind to i can't force you i can only attract those who have a sense, inner self-sense there's more okay even when i was a teenager i had some sense i didn't come on a very clear set but i'd look around at the world and say is this it if this is it what i see an experience and stuff i almost don't give a it just didn't interest me that much that was almost the beginning of my quest because i had some inner, calling in her calling since they couldn't stop processing doing the work continuing because his call was so strong because, his call was so strong because it was strong the energy forces would beat on him and say hey wake up there's more he didn't have any choice he said he was under pressure all the time and that's a negative way of saying it but the forces were saying hey there's more okay you have to use the word pressure probably not a good word for you people uh but just that oh there's more hold on open up to the more let them more who am i now at this level anything, okay, now a few tricks on this opening, opening we mentioned the underworld part of it is not known well you know again this upper part easier awareness the underworld is not known well so we're trying to bring that out because it's hard to move dimensionally fully if you won't have your center plant get rooted or realize there is a root there and part of in taking the energies from the circle pot to the plant better deeper roots call that slurpy, and the plant is getting enhanced so we have to contend with that the unknown under half unfortunately but tried to tell some stories but again you have to sit with it if you sit and you're sitting on you have to continue to sit on the and easy open, now who the hell wants to open more but that's what i'd ask you to do open with the sense of you've already heard it's good stuff so bear with it i opened under juris because i was in quote a meditation thing i entered my meditation room i sat on my pillow and somebody got weird like that it was like whoa that's weird but i'm in i'm in i'm sitting here to meditate therefore it's okay somehow or tether okay and then i tell you the snake story snake pit story will become uh fertilizer, fertilizer, better fertilizer nutrients better than that life-giving bang and a boom of bang he's bigger than life i'm all over the place tonight say something sensei this is justin a uh a word that guides me is available as i'm going through an easy the eye and a settling unraveling process i, sense more availability for, the obvious and the things that are not obvious the nutrients that are available to me are identified absorb i can soak in them um what could, i could i jump in there and say and say wow this is fantastic people what a gift the more is here, and now don't go anywhere it's internal finer dimensions my words and there's more there whatever you need is available that's the uh that's the, pot and plant that you set up you all of you that you set up and it's, available we sometimes make it a lot of work we approach it like work but, real soon you got to catch us and that's not that much work easy settle, find your dimension i give you that fast thing i'm already at a better level i can feel the terrain it's like whoa this is nice here nice stuff hey and there's more i'm kind of lazy so i just hit a little bit on my own i'll go deeper with it hey but it shouldn't be a lot of hard work you know don't pick up your pig and, try to dig through the clay thick dirt with the rocks in there that's dumb that's dumb uh realize these are easy to pass through after a bit that doesn't mean oh let me imagine i'm passing through there i am i'm in a very fine dimension and i'm a beautiful person okay i got it you got yeah i would say like it's on the flip side of that you're letting go but, also there's something coming back we're not just letting go there's a there's a there's a availability something's coming in too beach, beach exactly the circle training center going back as well so, anyway yeah i'm here at this level hey out there i'm a center type hey out hey out there i'm a center type hey out there what's here for me and that stuff from the circle feeds in and i ingest it through the center character plant oh thank you yes i feel a little fuller i feel a little happier i feel a little stronger i feel a little smarter oh thank you yes there's more hit it again so that, pump is like if there's an exercise that we should do forever and a day no matter what dimension you're in it's center to the circle boom can't go wrong can't go right and go the whole distance with that finer and finer and finer and finer and finer and finer the whole distance all the way up to the goal post okay and any one level is better than the previous level robert is a lot better than bobby living in a two by two world is a lot better than you remember you're one by scrunch in a bit one by world yeah it's like you're afraid to go outside you wouldn't pick up the phone you want to be bothered you can't take the responsibility or the pressure to buy a bit better three by hey not bad not bad, day fair day good day same pattern just change the words but it's the same okay, that, movement from one boom through the whole uh a little better can get faster and faster and faster that doesn't mean use your idea that way experientially faster, okay so get a clear experience whatever with the first few levels the one to a two to a three you're on your way you got the basics there, bobby to robert. you're on your way you got the basics there okay bad day fair day good day you're on your way you've got the basics the basics won't change you've got the basics, make sure bases to start with are good that's what we try to do standing present, reference a center circle, center reference there's a character there experience it for a moment some moments ah, okay, then let's move on easy the eye and you're moving into the next set okay so, uh do them properly one two three uh, and later you'll get very fast at it i, just literally the word fast because let me think about that i'll be able to do a test in my mind i don't mean that i mean actual uh hey we're actually stronger actually have a little power actual not the idea of it boom actual i don't mind me i'm a macho type so i show it that way but i could be more loving, i could be prettier i'd have to work on that one yes, okay, boom, so but do right with your starting place in the next couple to make sure your, form is good if you don't have good starting form generally in, physical activity we don't want to do an advanced move when we don't have a decent form to begin with okay something like, that if you don't have good form picking up a 20 pound barbell why should we ask you to try for the hundred pound barbell you're going to hurt yourself it's not going to work right okay, so get your good form get your good form and we want to move into quote heavier good form into the heavier you don't lose your basics blah, blah same old story people but i think we have to keep reminding ourselves uh, and clarifying any little misunderstandings uh anything that can facilitate the potential smoothness of this the wow this is fun wow as, as, uh florida was saying uh justin as justin was saying wow there's something there and, it's available, right justin basically what you're saying, wow what a gift wow [Music], again one of my big exciting insights uh, was nicer in whatever form it was showing back in the day was there and if i went out a little further or, got a little tighter and i used to practice so i mentioned in tokyo go get drunk which was easy to do with the boys then and i'd come home and sit to meditate and i could get to that same quote nice place that level had established a certain level there that i used for reference, that place but because i coming from being drunk it took me a little bit longer, okay to get there but lo and behold it was there it didn't say we don't let drunks in here sorry not you you're a drunk it was there then i tried it with uh i'm finding myself pissed off now and then uh and doing the same thing i stopped let me sit and i'd be sitting being still pissed off a bit another very easy and, whoa all of that internal nicer was there but it took me a little bit longer because i was still bitching it was there wow that was that was wow to me i mean i was brought up catholic you screw up that said for you kid purgatory here you go i know it took a little bit longer but it was there i could soak in it i could feel it i could whatever, it was there holy people that's exciting i mean what are we doing to ourselves i'm a bad person i'm this i'm that hey i present myself as an i do that truly and purposefully you can be an and catch a couple of tricks here easy settle open and, niceness, strength, wisdom whatever you need is there the schmooze are there for you the nutrients are there and they're proper because they're nutrients for the plant that you chose you chose all of this i know you don't remember when you're a bobby, but as you settle in open and settle in open, the, nutrients will help the plant to get better and between the two of them there'll be a better sense of what kind of plant i said some good stuff i know all up i said some good stuff there someplace oh my god we ate up time somebody, mike's open need any clarity on this gobbledygook here uh sensei bob here amen one thing that takes some of the work out of it as you were saying and all suggested was is this, more, is reaching for you even as you're reaching for at the level you're starting at is you are reaching for it i'm sorry uh so i, think reaching is good reaching a bad reason why i'm sorry i missed something i don't know, but reaching is good in this case in other words the, more original the mention of consciousness that you are is reaching toward you the lesser level even as the lesser level is reaching to hit so it isn't it isn't just one direction in that sense bob i'm just leery on the word reaching the way people do it okay when they reach for something it's like an idea for something reaching for right uh centers is that what we did standing square away easy the eye for the next level it's there the next level is there you don't have to reach for it i'm just literally the word people reach and they'll get mental and reach for something that's that don't worry uh we're gonna have a session one time on passing over because so many of you are getting older i don't want to present a couple of tricks i told you before i'm not an expert, on that but i track a couple of people uh anyway i'll get into it when we get into that subject, anyway i'm just leery of the word reach because of what people do with that word but you got to say thank you finishing up people anybody got anything then say it's tom hey hi sensei um at camp i always enjoyed when you shared your process of uh sound as a as a vehicle for opening up opening up and creating character and i just i know it's getting late but i thought if you could just say some something about that yeah i never know how sound is going to come across i'd love to do i love group chants but we can't do it whatever right uh yeah basically i think i did one here a simple form uh that uh let's say i'm just making this up you can do whatever form you want but the center is an off the circle the circle is an o okay because i tend to be start with center first i have a sensor the r is touching you and saying hey, hey okay, the o the o felt that request that touch from the center and said oh okay and it comes back now it's coming back with the nutrients so the center ah is the plant in need says hey i'd like to be healthier they all heard them their partners responds with oh which are vibrations at the level we're at the ah is affected the center stalk plant is affected that feels a little bit better but it could be better and it sends that out with the next the oh felt that says oh he wants more he's my partner now i don't know how it came across on there but the ah sounded a bit better i don't know longer a little clearer maybe i maybe just i could hear i don't know if you clear over that the o was definitely a better o also the o uh was a little clearer on a little bit deeper to the roots and then from the roots the plant intakes the nourishment that the o provided ah and he's starting to feel better in some form okay uh so i use uh and then we can pick up the sounds and do uh do uh, the different ones uh oh since they had one that i, was kind of like that let's see for me i use yeah uh circle hears it responds and she responds [Music] i like that yay to the and that's the way i approach it that uh it's responding in kind is that the okay way of saying it yay yeah all right so it's that same pattern just a little more extended uh and there'd be um and bigger versions uh, longer chance something that are going out and, a response from the circle back to this character plant center so if there's an ongoing exercise it's that beat okay feels like a breath and i'm gonna do a breathing form yeah, but the same thing again don't forget that centered stalk breathing form whatever tendency it exhales and it inhales and then you say oh i'm breathing deeper at first okay and then you say oh my god something breathes through me okay now there are finer levels of breathing when you get that sense of it breathe breath, grease it breathe through you, yeah but don't forget to check okay at this level say the breathing level feels very nicely balanced don't forget but now double check the center, center who's the character here yeah don't forget that part of it yeah see the, two beats in that case are like parents who's the kid in town who's the character yeah, and that goes all the way along oh since i had a character uh even as it was getting finer and finer oh yeshiva of aikido of aikido that was a character at a certain level of aikido didn't mean the dojo aikido that was his uh he used aikido i mean how the universe works he was shiva of the universal beat of things, that's what he meant okay he didn't mean him the dojo but yeah don't forget that center part because you, need to i don't know what to say be involved i don't know the right word be involved be a character be somebody i don't know didn't jesus eventually become jesus the christ i'm not christian enough to know the history of certain words whatever but, yeah there's a little kid his name is jesus hey you know but, but the realization of the inner of himself the christ fancy level fancy became the buddha thank you thank you sensei that's a great way to start the weekend thank you okay, start mine with a ship a line here and, sensei we're, right at eight o'clock so uh thank you it's wine time yes wine time uh now the other one oh, um, thanks for hanging out i'm sorry i was a little bit all over but so be it thank you sensei thank you so much thank you thank you so much thank you thank you sensei thank you very much thank you thank you very well hey bob leichner missed him missed him okay good night everyone i was just going to say lauren it's um with mike um so it'll, it'll be an hour change for us, next week next week uh you start on sunday correct oh yeah sorry so what

um so [Music] so hmm [Music] hmm and good evening everyone welcome once again to natto sensei's virtual dojo and i'm lauren hare and ken kron and richard moon and brad jacobson, and katja shimona are once again pulling it together to help sensei come up with his crazy wild-eyed theories this time it's the potted plant theory two weeks ago it was the sponge theory and some place in there there's aikido and a lot of wisdom and uh and uh since they'll be with us in just a minute if anybody has anything to announce or they want to say got a few minutes to talk this is probably just an opportunity to say um you know ken and i sit here and look like we're really part of this event but i just have to acknowledge lauren i just want everyone to take a minute and appreciate what he really does to keep all this happening thanks so much lauren it's juggling while tap dancing that's all, right looks like the usual suspects are assembling we're up to uh 25 people uh last week was uh almost 40. so uh people come in a few minutes late is the new on time steve how's your how are you coming from your after your surgery uh thank you for asking uh doing okay not i'm not using a walker at all walking around knee is still you know balking but uh but i'm getting there bending it and uh i'm gonna have outpatient physical therapy next week and uh hopefully i, can play uh nine innings of baseball very soon well you can bend it like that yeah no thanks man it's getting good, that you're recovering it's always good news i think we're just about ready you know resume my recording and uh we're just waiting for nado sensei to and we're waiting so we pull taffy we stretch this long interval, just a few more seconds no we're here and here's bob right, thank you richard yes hello, thank you for being here how about this, is good i didn't draw that did you no, you've seen my sketches why would you even say that i told katya she's gotta frame this one potted plant theory anyway before we get into that uh last week we uh were talking about the possibility of inner work as uh tapping it for healing capabilities uh how'd you do with that um, you see now i heard uh steve talk about bending his knee and then going for the outside therapy and fine no problem no problem i didn't hear one word about i settled in there and there was a finer body and from that finer body it radiated out and, things were showing that would help my leg i didn't hear any inner, to the outer any anybody have anything to say about a carryover from last week ah here you go steve oh i don't want to hear from steve now it's too late the dog ate my homework oh god yes i got something to say it's andreas hello yeah so i was uh meditating with uh way, so andreas i'm sorry but your face is completely in shadow it's okay i'm right here there please oh god you're most conceived, sorry okay that's the best i can do okay, thank you it's not about anyway so the, healing i, feel that the healing has a lot to do with breathing in the air i feel like that there's something in the our hara that is beyond that it's beyond our body so it's the system and that's how i was feeling it and it was the day after i was meditating with uh whey are you talking about l.a, way, yeah way yeah who are you okay anyway so i think that there's something and i, believe that there's something there's a connection with, the chakras and the breathing and that's it and i'm out and i and it does help me thank you uh last week uh um noah i was gonna call noah in for a minute or so because he was at the we kind of started introducing energy as a healing hands-on energy healing thing way back in the day in the day and uh bob liked that he got very good at it and he continued playing with it did there's anything you want to say about the about the levels of development you went through, the years uh meaning like first we do a hands-on and then so first it's kind of a hands-on thing you're, physically feeling the other person and trying to discern what's going on there, but then it becomes more subtle and you're really feeling the energy flow and eventually their energy, flow and eventually their energy body with your energy body and the more deeply you experience that the better your connection with the miss and what you were asking about carryover one thing i just noticed from last week to this week because i still do a fair amount of healing is i, wasn't as clear as i was after the class on friday that i was trying to carry the physical body over into the energy body and when i let go of that then the then the connection to the energy body got much stronger and eventually it fed back to the physical body on its own i didn't have to do it yeah, uh i, don't know if we tried to say this but i, mentioned a week or two or whatever ago, uh that um the, inner finer dimensions using uh bodies uh finer energy bodies and finer um, that if we that if we try to make bobby a robert uh there's going to be a little grinding static there uh clear from bobby in the next level opens and it mixes up if you would a robert okay uh a 10 pounder trying to be a 20 pounder we've got some fighting going on between mr 10 pounder and mr 20 pounder uh so it sounds like you're saying the same thing here that uh that you're trying to bring the body the heavy body into the finer body and why create that uh i don't know a freak that type of negative use of the word friction um that is inner to the outer period boom finer inner finer to the outer and outer kind of thing so made a dramatic difference yeah should, be so because again i think there's a lot of drag trying to bring the heavier into the finer it's it can be done you can learn a few tricks i probably did that a lot uh, but it's still a drag there's easier ways of doing it now yeah oh, thank you bob any anybody on uh carry over from, last week the potential of, inner to outer as a healing possibility and so this is patrick, patrick yeah for me the it seems like starting it uh some allowing calmness to occur and allowing relaxation to occur, and following that somehow, energy kind of flowing in a to and fro way, like a wave washing up on the shore and then receding it feels to me like there's a sequence there of calm reaching some state of calm and then allowing this to and fro of energy to have some kind of healing effect yeah, um so to move into finer we need uh some forms to move into finer uh and then at the finer level whichever level you're, hitting from that level potential emanation which you're calling that beat i believe uh so of course there has to be an easy the eye or something that transports us facilitates us moving out of bobby's level to an inner finer dimensional lever level of me so, yes, of course of course and i think in words we should probably one day not today but uh clarify uh, uh, maybe the words of what we're using for our process so, so that of course there's a process and then there's a, new location, kind of thing is that yeah, yeah, okay and if you're using that level for healing then some sense may be of that washing that the tide beating back and forth could we say or the waves uh that in there is a this is a healing force, flowing to where it's supposed to flow and, this is a this is a healing force flowing to where it's supposed to flow with the sense that, inner healing beat is flowing through head through heavier dimensions okay yeah so naturally from the inner finer flowing out through the physical body and, aiding it helping it uh the healing of the body if you would so yeah, and then i guess all we're saying is uh it looks like the better inner finer dimension you can get to the uh stronger the forces are that would emanate in a healing factor okay yes anybody thank you patrick anybody any anything here before we move on to the topic for tonight uh gene is on tonight uh gina i tried to call you the other day but you weren't home apparently or you didn't pick up i'll try you another day okay i would always pick up your name you weren't home no and i appreciated last week it made my sitting my sitting i don't know more focused i, don't know more focused i, don't know what i think you know it was like a good instructions good path to go on okay, yeah i wanted to follow up with you on that, thank you [Applause] okay potted plant theory you know basically this is just another look-see at the same old manifest universe okay uh but different angles on it different words might facilitate your, sense of it better uh so uh can you see that uh yes you can i'm sure you can that there's a darker line that's a smaller pot, that's a smaller pot that's a bigger pot are we okay with that you can see that oh okay yep yeah okay potty plant theory ta-da there we go beautiful okay so okay so uh this is in a pot okay you can't see it because it's quite plasticky there now you can see it um but eventually this plant quite likely want to grow bigger and, that, level, that it's existing and won't be able to aid it to grow or sustain it okay all right so when it looks like it's reaching its, peak growth then we go oh it's time to repot it put it in a bigger pot okay very similar to the human condition i, would like to be more i want more i need more oh okay fine you can't get it out of your present existence fine no problem yes we just repot you and that's a dimensional change okay so we're moving from this dimension and we have a little process to enter another dimensional realm or pop okay, uh there are uh if i pull this plant out of its pot okay, there may be a moment whatever a moment is where it panics because it's lost its home for a moment but it's going to pretty quickly take up resonance in this new dimensional home but there could be a little ah what's happening to me adjusts takes up residence in the new pot okay and when i was meditating i, bumped into that uh with my journey uh it felt like i was dying going to die or dying, going to die or dying okay and the first really it was a strong feeling of death and then as i continued it worked out okay and then i began to realize that it was just i was just changing pots or dimensional levels i was entering a new dimension but before i could enter a new dimension there's a feeling like you're dying after all i got so used to it that as i was continuing moving it to finer uh there'd be a little blip uh which had that same sort of death thing there's some moment just a moment's blip so oh that's the border i'm moving into a new zone so it became a second little blip but it more clued me in that i was ah entering a different level a different state okay like the highway signs where they say you are now leaving illinois and you're entering whatever is next to illinois i don't know who i forget excuse me okay potted, plant the and certain basics are ongoing uh when, this one is going into here a little bit of panic because things aren't clear yet but it's still a center and circumference or center and circle okay when we did our one by two by three by uh we kind of followed that the one by had a center and circle but things were kind of tight we did a little process to move into a two by two and things were a little freer the, pot was bigger the center positioning was better there were more energies there or soil nutrients mixed up a better plant nado, or i'm a two by two or now hey feel better, we continue with the three by three so it's pretty much the same pattern i just thought these different stories might give you a little different flavor okay, ah where are we potty plant potted plant that and you get so used to this process that you don't mind moving along because you know it's going to be a better pot with more nutrients and what do you want to call that faith okay, that originally there was a great uh a pottery maker a great husbandry man whatever, his title is and it's set up that way and with a little practice you catch oh it only gets better a bobby moves to robert who's better than bobby similar but better, but robert moves to nado similar but better uh and you begin to expect it that's how it works okay sophia oh but who am i going to be and will i like me and that's oh it's going to be you come on okay so if we so putting a tomato plant let's say into the new pot the tomato plant shouldn't worry about am i going to become a pear tree i'm a tomato plant you're still going to be a tomato plant but you'll be a healthier tomato plant, you'll produce more naturally you'll, produce more naturally you'll feel better about yourself if i could say, okay it's a continuation of you okay uh what can be a little interesting is you really don't know who you are as you continue you realize there's more of you that, bobby never would have figured out if you had told bobby things about nado plus, bobby wouldn't know what to do with that uh so it's still been a bobby nadeau lineage and will continue to be but there'll be things opening up and being present and facilitating growth uh to, a style that i might not at first be used to or wow is that me kind of thing can i do that what whatever am i saying anything intelligent yet uh sensei this is bob noah hi noah hi one of the things you put a lot of emphasis on in our training all along was, that, feeling that you first identified you know is feeling like that and then it became a blip you worked hard i think with some success in getting us to welcome that experience, as, a change to the next level rather than resisting it or fearing it or whatever and that was a big that was a big help to me and how did i do that what did i say what did we do well we felt that ripple you said it's not a ripple of death or a ripple of some horrible change or you're going to be frankenstein next week or something feel that ripple relax and settle into it and welcome it yeah uh yeah so when you pull out and you're moving into this one okay, and again they're all overlaid always they're overlaid okay uh so when you pull out you're moving into that one easy and open and you're sort of allowing the soil with all of its better nutrients to come into play faster uh smoother what i'd like what's happening here and stuff so, yeah it's just that, ability of making those shifts not just faster but more open more natural more uh, conducive to faster growth or something it's not a shouldn't be a big hassle okay might be some moments especially at first we have to easy and relaxing you're not sure yet okay i think when we did the one by two by three buy uh and you hit the two by uh, you weren't sure yet who you were as a two by twoer but within a couple of minutes you started to started to get a flavor you started to feel the effect, ah, started the after feeling the effect have a better idea sense of you in your world uh but it took a few, minutes no big deal i just don't crowd it up with a bunch of you're slowing down things you don't have to slow down okay the this uh plant moving out of that pot into that pot, is just is just finer better it's going to help there's no reason to bring in a bunch of static could i say uh or a bunch of do i want that it's too natural it's too easy it's too you okay, to you even though you're not sure who you who you are at that level vase it'll unfold okay there'll be something more for you you'll like it it's natural whatever um what dumb words could i use have faith trust uh you do a few pots and it's follows a pattern it's better so you want to use the word trust okay it sounds a little silly to me now because it's just oh yes oh yeah so yes but if you need those words fine have faith, have faith when you let go of your body that it'll be okay there'll be something better there trouble if you need those words fine but after a bit, they sound a bit silly to you where the hell are we jump in say something help me here um it seems like chip, chip hi chip the plant wants to grow it, inherently is built in the system that it wants to kind of reach its potential, and it'll adapt and, uh can and conform to the limited, shape it's got but it always wants to reach its reach its fulfillment maybe it won't flower until it gets to that bigger pot then it goes okay, different plants maybe have different, plants maybe have different destinies but they all want kind of the same thing in a way yeah and some plants some people uh have a little stronger desire to grow than maybe some oth others uh so we have to take that into account uh let me uh chip i'll get back to you uh noah christ or christian say something about seeds being thrown out on the ground what do you help me here yeah it was uh matthew chapter 13 verses 4 through 9. basically he said if you put the seeds into fertile soil they'll grow you put it into rocky soil they won't okay, we can look at people uh some people are heavy and they're everything is kind of rocky as they settle and open whatever if they want to they enter more fertile soil and they begin to grow inner spiritually could we say but they'll grow physically they'll grow with more awareness, they'll be better family men better athletes better businessmen whatever it's, all available uh, so, uh, some people are push more to grow than others, uh if you're still watching this show after two years uh it's got to be something unless you're really bored making you sit down on a friday night and hang out with this stuff okay there's some kind of inner desire inner sense that yeah, and uh some other people don't, have any leave me alone i'm happy with my beer and my game i'm watching or my potato chips whatever yeah fine if you're satisfied fine but some people aren't they have a sense of more they have a desire for more okay, all, yeah right back to chip, anything that, oh that's good sensei that that's good and um it like you say the transition is, there's just a moment but then it, kind of grows into its new space and it has that sense of uh yeah this, feels better it's like the one by two by three by itself yeah every pattern i think one day one night we just should go over some of the main patterns and uh spending a few minutes with each one so we can see oh my god basically they're in a certain way all the same not exactly the words we use and, and some people might like one pattern better than another uh but the, essence uh of how to move through the manifest universe uh there's a similarity to that so, yes, uh, did we cover chip i got lost there are we okay chip that's good sensei yeah thank you okay somebody help me here potted plant does that make sense to you is that okay, let me jump in it's not just an idea i'm presenting the idea but if you're going to fund with it you have to okay you have the idea you have the idea that you're going to get repotted in your own system okay and then you have to get that sense of it easy the eye let go whatever ah that ah that maybe an emptiness sense for a moment whatever you gotta hang there and feel the nutrients of the soil it's not just an idea and you're going to get a lot out of this with the idea there might be a, trickle down or a trickle up or a trickle through but it's, a trickle okay it's like this uh, this being this being aware that there's better soil but this itself has to have roots, roots depth, we start with a better feet grounding those are our starting words but it continues on down, so it can really, suck up the nutrients deeper roots going out, slurping sucking up the nutrients they're getting mixed and this plant gets better and stronger okay so uh, again, when we talk about it on a friday night we're, hopefully you're getting aware of it that's an important piece have an idea about it very important but the next very important piece is the experience of it so you must play have some sense of playing, so using the potted plant uh playing there are nutrients there [Applause] playing that they're mixing and pervading your center character ah, you got to hang out there and, play with it's not just an idea alone, okay this is kind of critical a lot of smart people out there are fast with their mind and stuff they read a lot of books they know a lot but the actual beingness we really need to experience that process of how the plant sucks up the uh energies qualities of the better soil okay and that pattern continues so it just gets finer and finer and finer in the potted plant theory uh there's more soil with more nutrients in it okay, and that's the pattern all right um you each have your own say, certain nutrients that you need but you're, already connected with them okay, [Music], and as you settle and get transplanted or repotted the nutrients that are important for you are available to you uh what a tomato plant needs different minerals or whatever than a lemon tree but in how it works they're, available to you individually okay if you're a musician and you settle and you open there's going to be more energies to facilitate a better musician okay if you're a fighter it's gonna be more energies to make you a better fighter faster stronger more aware whatever uh so, the uh nutrients are already there okay it's a law again okay, um so you don't have to tell the soil what to be it's fun to go at it with what's here now and let it unfold you know you're doing a good job when you're surprised at who you are in your in your in your process and gee i didn't know i had that or i didn't know i, could be that whatever the right words are you're a little surprised because you didn't set it up i want to be this it's like yeah but who are you really trust the system it's just you unfolding okay yeah trust the bigger potted you to know more about you than the smaller pot does okay i'm, blurbing again uh help somebody jump in on potted plants anything exciting here for you sensei this is lauren and uh i, think i just want to come back to uh what i think chip started with is that it's, the plant's inherent nature is to grow put into a new plot pot it will it will grow as much as it can in one pot and then you put it in another pot it naturally, without thinking it's its nature and people are like that too i think that you know but yeah but you as people we have to like not prevent ourselves from sucking up all the, negativity aspect will block it out yeah, uh and you brought up last week also the word natural and, i said yes you're right but we have to be careful oh this is naturally going to happen i'm going to let go and let god yes it's natural but i, have to i don't know the words uh be alive in the process be present in the process partake of the process experiential activity it's active yes within the process yes, yeah, yes i, understand that it's not passive and it's not gonna happen to you, you have to do it and you have to be it and you have to go through it through it actively yeah we need a word there yeah, yeah what was the word if i remembered it's going way back yoga dear god uh volition you get started volition if it if, there's something more it'll happen i, think you need something to help to start it listen, you need something to separate out you from the seed that hits the rocky ground and that's it nothing happens and the seed that hits fertile soil and starts to sprout and da, da nddd yeah so whatever that word is yes thank you thank you you've used that phrase you've got to put it in your body there's some real active something you do there and i'm thinking you know you probably do this so automatically yes unfortunately yeah that you don't even think about it and then there are those things like i'm thinking when you tell your story about easy and how enlightening that was for someone whereas for you, didn't even think about it is there anything you can point to about how you do it when you create more space for yourself that seems so obvious you shouldn't even bother to have to tell us okay first i don't use the word i create space, i settle so the space that's there can show that it's there and i settle to not interfere to allow the nutrients that are there to form in whichever way they form and to create that level of me whoever i am okay so i partake of the process i don't tell the process a certain way what, to do so am i okay in taking exception to how i use the word or how, the word might be heard by some people much appreciated okay uh then what's your question here um [Applause] okay a simple example again uh okay i, know by having run this many times that if i settle in open there is a pot that has a lot of energy in it okay my first pot is more body and even a smaller pot a tight body of an air kind of thing you know pot, pot there's a pot here real soon about where the energies flow a bit okay easy in that pot not just an idea in that pot a sense feeling experience it's vague but first one made in that energy pot easy there is an energy or a body with a lot of energy i'm starting to feel things light up a bit, easy, again, boom, all right all right and then reach a point where i can do an energy arm thing boom it's just because of this there's that the inner manifest to the outer it's energy on or extend better now i extend it extends sometimes i'm surprised when it's out there so well who put it out there, so well who put it out there meaning in the earlier stages i put it out there out there send say how do you want me to do this oh i want to do it better ah stop it inner to the outer inner experience if it's just idea you won't really get enough of the experience or it'll be there for some moment and then fleet away or you'll flee your way out of there some, sense of this inner experience inner experience and it manifests radiates let's say radiates, or flows outward i don't know if i said it very well but for me this is like early basics haven't we covered this a million different ways in the in all of our simple original layouts well i, just say i think i've told you this you know when i started there were many times early on when i heard you say something and i thought okay i think this guy actually is crazy and then my wife said the same thing it's not unusual go ahead crazy success and then you know a week a month whatever later i go oh wow oh i s oh wow you know it would have that kind of a uh, take me a while to hear it or something like that i guess i'm um i'm watching you do this process by which you would follow out oh i'm getting i'm getting a whatever, and that was very valuable to me to watch you do that and watching you even do it tonight again it reminds me that sometimes yeah you forget that uh i don't know if it's because you've done it so long or you were natural to begin with or a combination but you do gloss over it sometimes and it can be very helpful to us as we uh yeah as i see you do your process thank you yeah i, kind of know that i, know i, don't often remember the early beginning years i, know that and i know as it got more comfortable i do move through faster uh also i know i've tried to present a lot of simple things the energy arm bending thing uh being centered and lifting uh i tried to present some very simple things, be centered and like push against your hips, actually experience the center if you're actually experiencing a center oh you feel stronger here if you have an idea about it it'll break down quicker or you'll take your idea and try to inflict your center on me it's like no don't come at me that way that's just an indication of which direction you're going in so we've done a lot of simple things, and i guess if i have to i'll keep repeating the simple things okay um is that do us anything well sensei this is lauren i just want to say simple doesn't mean irr irrelevant and basic can be said to be fundamental and universal so yeah i think richard's on the right track here yeah no i've got no problem here and uh thinking i was crazy he took my wife, uh this is before we were married six months to realize i wasn't quite as crazy as i first sounded begin to make sense to her every time she became crazy and, and, and began to realize where i was going and what i was doing took her i think six months right katja again if i made just the, watching you kind of play with these subtle feelings then and bring them into experiential process uh you know okay i'm getting i'm feeling more of this whatever it was uh very helpful i just say that again and yes a simple fundamental over and over yeah, yeah hey did the sound change we okay, uh, i heard some static or something uh yeah and anything you want to use for uh an out there reference for inner work okay, um, see the problem tends to be uh let's say some people have a little sense of inner work and their outer check is let's say an art like tai chi or like whatever, and unfortunately human condition what begins to happen is they begin to put all their time on the outer work it's like no, no inner outer now back to inner finer inner now outer, now back to inner you see and we kind of don't do that we get caught up in the outer and then we try to do more variations on the outer and then we, try to finesse the outer and, and we see if we can beat other people with our outer and then we get kind of carried away and, this inner work is, a lip service is given to the inner work as opposed to having a better relationship inner now a little outer check okay good i checked inner, [Applause], oh my arms feel longer now better longer good inner i'm feeling more my feet feeling like they're extending feeling more dead okay outer and i feel my feet oh feet arms oh my feet support my arms however to say that properly uh so anything outer that you can use anything wash dishes whatever clunk your guitar blow your horn richards but sometimes play a game where you enter and then you i don't know blow a note or two i don't know the term terminology or the piano player i don't know one whatever that first you know what the first but uh just check the keys out oh scality they run your scales and then go back to inner you have any sense of anything in there you're more settled your, breath is beginning to change your little straighter, ah i had to clear your scales that's enough i'm not saying please scales for an hour see now you're going into outer, outer, inner, better level play your scales okay so i, have done and probably will continue to do a lot of games like that okay, the human condition we tend to get i don't know what to say here over involved with the outer i don't know how to say it in a nice social way or to be understood but you often forget your inner as you get involved in the outer and if you've done any degree of inner you're probably better than the norm you're better than the other people at that you're pretty good okay why should you change anything why should you look for more you're better than everybody else in your neighborhood kind of thing so there's a lot of reasons that we uh stop preceding inner finer, following bigger pots okay human condition all right so some people do a bit produce better and you stay at that level others will be pretty good and say yes but there's more there's more and they'll do more inner and produced okay something like, that not said well but you get the drift human condition somebody where are we potted plant anything in the potted plant thing this is bob one of the things he told us from day one just about was oh simpson would come out he would check himself out before a class if he didn't have what he thought he needed he'd do his circle and center kind of practice with the joe then he'd check him again and then he'd go back again, and you said you asked him what are you doing when you do that and he said you're the only person who's ever asked me that question because everybody else was focused on what he could do on the outer side after he did his process but nobody ever asked them what the process was except you well that's why i was main thing i was interested in even though i was a martial artist so yeah but he had this inner thing and i was very interested in the inner thing, very, so, when you asked him what did he say oh come on lord uh, he started to unfold his process at my level to me uh in semi-giverish japanese crazy talk i did the best i could to get a sense of it and would go home and sit and see what, i could experience da, but don't ask me for what, he said that way thank you maybe uh chip again one more thing about the potted plant yeah that i think in the in the adjustment to the bigger pot it's disconcerting in some, ways you know to adapt to that to adjust and go oh my god this is a bigger space is this okay is this getting comfortable with that getting, comfortable with that getting in that transition anything to say about that, i, think with a little practice you know, you're not clear where you're at okay whether it's a moving into a two by or a three by three uh after being a one by one or it you're not clear where you're at you're at moving into a bigger pot would be the same thing it's not clear there'll be other things maybe to let you know you're in something well that you're out of your norm in something but it's not clear okay, i don't know with a little practice you're not you don't get consternated anymore about that you're easy there easy settle some more easy open some more if it unfolds it begins to show itself so it could be all dark or blank or seemingly empty but as you know hey easy settle open it begins to unfold it begins to begins to show what it is and what it's doing and how it will mix you so you'll be you a citizen of that level comfortable there you have a title oh i'm robert now i'm not bobby anymore uh so things like consternation yes of course easy, it will unfold easy it will unfold, okay, uh and usually in a basic beginning it unfolds and clarifies fairly quickly as you go finer and finer and finer there are some unfoldings that hmm the fineness of them maybe uh it doesn't unfold to me 15 minutes that's not really clarifying so at a certain level it's so fine what could i say takes me a little bit longer, in just hanging out or i may be at it one day for 15 minutes and, nothing's clear hit it the next day 15 minutes maybe not yet clear third day fourth day oh, oh, this is what's happening this is what's going on you're experiencing it uh, but again but again there was no change except there was consonation then i learned to settle and it unfolded so if i hit something that unfolds finer let's call it and it's not clear don't consternate you know come back at it again and eventually it has to show that it's just a hell of a nice big pot and great things are going on in there and mixing yeah uh so uh so yeah, tricks of the trade or yes there will be consternation now you're going to get involved in consternation or you're going to be yes there's consternation now easy settle open a bit more and this means let it all bend settling, deeper let it open it'll clarify itself you see you see that kind of thing yeah, yeah thank you and uh in just a little practice then those tricks of not getting consonated or majoring in the consternation don't happen you you've kind of learned the tricks, of the trade we call for example me personally i, don't like not knowing in this work and so if i'm following some process and i don't know quite what's happening or where it's going or something i personally don't like that i don't like, not knowing but what i've learned is if i don't panic and screw it up and continue the next day that, it begins to clarify and then it's known experientially known not just aware known but experientially known uh so i don't get as freaky about not knowing as i used to although it still nudges me it's my thing but i, don't get carried away with my with that i don't know if i said that well yeah [Music] i don't know if you're exercising let me see if this is right let me say and see if it's right uh and you uh you change your uh, bicep, exercise to a different angle they've got angled bars now for example so your arms are turned a bit different arm and you're curling it's not a shock that you'll be a little sore, you weren't sore the month before because you're doing your basic one you might have gotten sore uh the first few days or a few times but after all you don't really, get sore let's say you change the angle on the exercise and whoa you get sore again is anything wrong no it's going to happen every time every time you change and get into something a bit different that's going to happen i don't think to go crazy in the barbell gym saying i'm sorry what's wrong i gotta call a doctor i'm sore or mr america tell me what i i'm not mr america because you'll confuse that uh mr bodybuilder tell me how to do this because i'm sore hello what are we doing i don't know if that made sense help i'm going crazy out here sensei linda esken iceland i had a thought um i'd love to hear your thoughts on it that it's my understanding that sometimes we can process our way into a new level we can sort of see some potential and work our way into it but thinking in terms of the plant you know as you did you repotted it and there's times in our lives when we can get repotted we might end up with a promotion at work or suddenly off at college or in a different, circumstances new relationships that call us to be a bigger version of ourselves or provide us with better nutrients and more space and, and, do you agree am i on the right track that, both of them you're a worker with a bunch of other workers okay, and you're kind of comfortable being a worker, okay the pot you're in it's supplying enough nutrients where every day you can go to work and be a pretty good worker day after day just say okay yes, okay, and then eventually let's say one day they want to make you a manager, okay, now let's say you don't have the pot of manager soil so you might say no i'm not ready for that job and you might walk away from it no not, me thank you but not, me okay or you know how it works and you go whoa manager and you go home and you sit and settle and start to open up for the energies that will mix up a manager they're available to you okay they're all within the next pot and as you uh play with that a little bit then you'll become a manager who's comfortable being a manager okay, yeah so that's when the problem comes at you, and you know how to do pot to be equal to the problem you do aikido so uh, uh you're sort of centered so you can sort of handle one okay, sorry it's okay it's only throw two or three at you, don't have enough center to cope with them, if you remember those days three attackers jesus no all right those days are very present sometimes yeah, to get better at this where the, center or this makes and using center, or this makes and using center i'm using i'm talking the same thing here uh boom it mixes somebody who has a better center, and has the capability of dealing with three that that's been our work you see yeah inner development for outer production could we say yeah uh and if we don't uh and following yours, linda uh the peter's principle which we mentioned a couple years ago i think uh where you don't know how it works and they uh increase your job title you finally reach a level where you're incompetent uh, lauren help me with the right word what's that incompetent not incompetent you rise to your level of incompetence yeah you rise to, give you better and better jobs bigger jobs to the point where you outrun your pot and you don't know the top theory okay you've been lucky and you've been natural to a certain point and then suddenly, lauren you're incompetent help yes, yes yeah, and, i just you rise because you're competent yeah you keep rising you outland beyond you and you're incompetent and you won't rise any further you outran your puck no the pot is there okay, there the situation might have helped pull you out of the pot or something but the pot and the plus pot is, there if we know how it works [Music] thank you so anyway the naturalness of, the pot the naturalness of the finer soil that's there, the naturalness of the better nutrients that are there uh that's a, dimensional truth this is just a dimensional process again people okay the smaller pot to a bigger pot is just a dimensional change we're just using the plants to kind of pick up the naturalness the uh um uh um how it works you get a little flavor there, uh have good roots so that you get to the bottom of the pot could we say and, you have good roots good ground so all the nutrients from that spread of roots can slurp me up all that positioning better positioning uh is important it's again just the awareness being the awareness, uh there's a tendency not to have roots that, spread and spread and slurp it up into an actual beingness okay could be awareness that oh better being but it's awareness it still hasn't experienced and we need a little practice said that's why i came up with one to five one idea one idea to five of playing with the experience just as a reference one to five because the idea is fast and, especially at first for a while uh to, have the soil energy minerals, catch up a little practice there pump the pump for a while one idea to five pumps how many ever five pumps is and whatever, um how do i get into that um i forgot how we doing people where are we potted plant potted plant fancy this is coco i'm sorry who gina hey eugene yeah i find that when i cross over in that go to the new pot place, the new place has so much energy it kind of kicks me out of my whole oh yeah, you know what i mean and i have oh yes all over again very much uh okay uh one trick and i've presented this in a very simple in the beginnings of energy work let's see uh let me do that [Applause] okay, i asked people to settle they were standing there and i asked them just, settle and be present and there is a deeper source of energy okay, if they haven't quite open and they step into this spot where there's a deeper source of energy it can kind of push them if they're sensitive they can actually feel the push i can feel the push it actually pushes me what do i do i go oh i'm not quite ready yet i'm not even back out of that spot okay, uh, double check settling and opening hit the spot again and make sure i'm really open, so the more there's more energy than i expected and because i'm more prepped for it now i open a bit better so it can flow through a bit better i've laid this out in class thank you thank you for years right noah's joining oh yeah we've done that a lot yeah, yeah um, so to be pushed out of course of course each uh dimension or pot has let's say uh it has more energy it's more and more soil more minerals and let's say an energy, core source there that radiates uh, as you get close to it and it pushes you of course easy open some more because you have the capability of being more fully there if i come in a little heavy if bobby tries to come in on some of this work ain't no way he's going to be really pushed out or the energies are so strong they really get bobby's head spinning i get headaches something in the old days playing it that way boom i wouldn't prep for the energy just check it out and hey my little head pressure that was not unusual have that happen, okay, uh if you play it a little softer there and you don't open enough you, start to realize you're starting to spin on your thought patterns all right so i used to play on, what would happen if we didn't settle and open some more and kind of catch how it works i tried to use the example of uh, oil drillers, uh, that if they hit the pool of oil in the old days it was a gusher, uh well if you haven't set the pipeline the center let's say or your presence properly of course it's going to push you it's going to knock over the what do they call that the, drilling rig the, dirt the rig is going to be knocked over by the gusher so you got to make sure the rig is proper, that's why we settle and square away a bit even as bobby so that as we continue that form format that we're using and opening it stays constant that's kind of important so a good squared away body open ah squared away robert with those same things there's a center in a circle there's energies mixing a character with a core make sure you got your basics there so as you continue you have that basic reference you have the uh what's the drilling rig again there derek the derrick is positioned better uh the pipe in the middle of the derrick uh that it's going to gush through his position better so the gusher doesn't destroy the lesser one yeah so we laid out stories like that to talk about the problems or the experience that you had it's like oh yes of course you're getting close how do you know just push me out oh okay what should you do settle and open because you're a little heavy potentially coming in and it pushes out heavy, easy, as you're more easy the eyes the more sense easy settle open and uh it doesn't push you after a bit because you're, equal to it you're equalizing with it great tip thank you now you tell me after all these years thank you i know [Music] ah, it's uh it's mike from new zealand sensei hey mike i have to you, just used the words that i was going to bring up for me the things that stick in my mind most about and of course i've only seen you and been with you and you know periodically over fairly substantial gaps in time were easy the eye, and open and allow and i mean and i mean you kept saying these words every time you came out at some stage in the camps you, always were saying them but what i realize now is that and i took those words on board but that was the point in the beginning they were words, that you understood i ran them through my mind and i, really wasn't i wasn't getting the juice of it i knew that but i didn't know what it was i wasn't getting but what i realize now is that eventually it's the feeling behind the words that i eventually caught onto yeah and i just really noticed that that's that, was that's what's happened for me they're no longer words they are something the picture is like a word and it's a concept or an idea it's awareness you're aware of the word what was missing experiencing the word oh i understand what settle is yes, oh there's no settling going on right so you hang out with it even though it's a word you think you understand totally fully do the process following that word easy and open has the word change a bit or the flavor of it has the flavor of it changed a bit not for the first second but continue ah settling open following the track of that word easy, oh i'm hearing another word right here it's not another word i'm jumping around on words sean are you on i'm not jumping around on words the word happened here it was easy and then i forgot already calm that's being called calmly, so along with easy there was a calmness sense okay easy okay still stay with that word easy finer, finer, experience the finer of that word get to this as best as you can the source of that word that word uh at least finer and finer and finer of that word experientially with some sense of feeling, yeah, yes, mike yes, yes and just i just wanted to add to what um richard and lauren said as well though i mean, although for you it's the distant past a lot of this stuff that's just you've absorbed into you and therefore you don't think about it it's repetition is, gold for a lot of us still yeah, uh okay yeah and i know from your point of view maybe that's um it could be frustrating um but yeah it is still really valuable for us, i mean i, mean i mean one of the things that's always stuck with me is because i often used to pick you up and bring you to the to the sessions or even how you stay with me or whatever i got to see you change, from, bob to robert to nado to sensei, as we got to the um dojo or wherever the camera was being held and then you know you might have been staggering around or having difficulty getting out of the car or not walking that well but you walked onto that mat and just a switch got flipped and you were a completely different human being and that always stuck with me even if i couldn't understand the words that you were saying or, get the feeling of the words yet it was clear that there was something there that goes way beyond any physical exercises yeah and this is a typical one in martial arts chinese martial arts and such uh it's all kinds of stories about the old i mean the really old-timer the old the old lady with the cane it was a martial arts and she cleans her way slowly up a few steps to get on stage suddenly she gets off the stage grabs her cane and, goes back to being an old lady that that's not unusual uh again that's tapping that inner not as an idea but as some kind of inner experience, and they light up okay uh the idea alone doesn't quite do it now some of you your idea your cl you, get maybe a little more feeling than other people but it's still not a major on the feeling so you don't want to misunderstand a partial feeling for you got it uh you, really want to double check this fullness of experience really hang out in the soil really feel hang out with the roots experientially not just aware of oh yeah roots i understand roots i took biology in high school what the hell is he talking about you know kind of thing uh, spent some time it's, and as you do it can get very fast again since it was damn fast at a damn find level why okay, but don't you worry about speed because there'll be a tendency to have a fast idea, and you haven't done anything it's about a fast idea yes uh that's the source of god's power here i am i don't think so let me push on you i don't think you have a center or whatever are you falling into my craziness yeah so i'm sorry to keep pushing that awareness, and experience but it's, critical it's critical people oh cynthia tried to tell you he, mentioned roots uh he said put it in your body uh, he had to walk around on your knees which was just the beginning level he didn't mean to stay there and get spiffy on your knees per se that was just hey it's down there and it's under also get that part of it get that part of it get that part of it um, and um in the human condition we tend not to get that part remember it's a lot of i don't know just christian but it's like uh, a spiritual, hate the body the body is horrible anything down here physical is not good i think even some of the shocker people oh no the chakras start here this is good anything lower oh no we don't that's bad stuff we have to transfer that and make that finer stuff by having it be up in here it's beautiful stuff it's part of the creation, it's, the fullness of creation it's two parts the great mind and the great body but, the name human condition and even before humans uh was a more of a major an awareness and, not in the actual experience so we have some ketchup work to do that's why i keep pitching on it okay it's very important yeah i'm blurring again uh getting late anybody anything did you get anything out of potted plants sensei i think it's uh you've kind of summed it up and uh um did you pay mike off for that little uh whatever it was commercial he just did for, the difference between the idea and the experience i thought it was like i mean it really exemplified why your i don't know what word i want to use repeating it how's that for delicate okay i know i didn't have to pan he's, finally becoming realized uh mike i offer you the last uh retort if you want oh no just um that those, words were freely given um you know i mean i've i have known bob for a long time but i've only got to know him in, little chunks over a long period if those chunks had all been condensed god where would i be now um is kind of my thought you know but, maybe, my journey needed needs to be that long maybe that's the nature of things and uh i just needed doses along the way to keep me encouraged it's not unusual uh i'll use in my case uh i can go through some of sensei's old notes okay and i read them long time ago or something and i could read them now and oh there's so many things there's so much clearer so me too you know you first hear something and yeah you think you understand or maybe you put a question mark meaning you didn't really understand it but as you develop, okay, suddenly uh the old stuff that you didn't understand you don't understand why you didn't understand it it's laying out pretty clearly now because you're at a clearer level could we say so you're not the only one a victim of that if we could use that word victim me too, that's how it works thank you mike thank you people and thanks bob thank you very much yeah sure thank you and thank you sensei i think that uh we're almost at eight o'clock, and uh and uh we'll all have to go tend our plants feel, the plants feeling with the nutrients, experience that's a sense game it sounds like make-believe but then you get involved, you can actually uncertainly feel it but whatever you play you figure it out thank you thank you thank you sensei and good night happy, gardening thank you sensei thank you thank you everyone thank you for class thank you good night i'm on

## Sponge Theory

um you to so good evening everyone and welcome back from two weeks and uh since he'll be with us in just a moment, um sensei is interested in chatting about picking up where we left off on january 7th which was uh easy the eye and, you know we were having a very animated conversation within the group about easy the eye you might recall that he talked about it and explained what he meant and then he led us through some processes and exercises breathing and making a little sound and standing, you know ah easy the eye and he wants to pick up there and then he wants to go forward into, what he what he calls, sponge theory so sensei will be with you with us all in just a moment and um i think we're going to start in two minutes, and uh and uh anybody wants to say anything to the group uh now's a good time before we uh sensei arrives and uh apparently i'm showing as nado shihan co-host but i'm gonna just so nobody's confused you could pass you look just like them just like just like all right and uh as always i want to thank ken, krohn richard moon brad jacobs, who are uh who are uh making this happen and katja who's kindly letting us use her, living room has uh the virtual dojo studio in his all these weeks and months put up with moving the furniture around changing the lights and but it's all in a good cause i think well we're into years now lauren we're into years our first uh our first session was march 13th 2020. so, we'll have to think about what to do on the second anniversary you know uh kind of started because of kovid but i think it's some sort of taken on a life of its own and uh even if kohid lets up uh, you know if people are interested i think sensei's willing to continue and uh whenever that is whenever that is he likes the commute huh, he likes the commute he, likes that people come to him and uh he likes being able to reach out to people far and wide uh that he wouldn't normally see or be able to uh interact with because they don't live in the bay area and go to the dojo on the same day that he goes to the dojo so it's um i think we're about ready if uh if uh brad if you want to light up your screen, and uh and uh i will uh continue uh your sensei and so good evening sensei hi good evening thank you ah, i hope you all enjoyed your little break it was a technical break we're okay now ah, okay so as uh lauren mentioned like chit chat a bit about uh how you did, your follow-up with easy the eye you seem to enjoy it seem to get a lot potentially a lot out of it let's, hang out there for a little bit comments on easy the eye hello out there in the viewing world how animated you were two weeks ago well sensei i have a tangent but i was holding that in case people wanted to go directly to easy the eye um you let me know when you want it okay what'd you get it's got a tangent not, necessarily directly easy the eye but for me it is are you saying you want to go out on the tangent with us is that is that what you said exactly, i'll hold it and see if other people you know are more online with easyvi okay there's got to be something about easy the eye people hello out there we got to do something to stop kenny from going out on a tangent well sensei this is lauren and i'll say uh the following day so we you know we, we were here in the virtual dojo on january 7th and the next saturday morning i taught a class mountain view and i just picked up where you left off and uh we used the uh the sighing ah, you know the, literally the sense of easing and relaxing and you know had everybody imagine what would be really satisfying to have done, and now that they've done it they can relax about it and ease their eye and make that sound and making the sound helped everyone myself included so and uh you know as, as a quick trick it really works yeah i had a friend uh aikido he started with he was a judo partner of mine way back, and then he when i came back to teach aikido he was my first student or virtually my first good boy um and he was hospitalized for something rather and he, learned a trick in the hospital that if he groaned it took away a lot of the pain and the doctor came by while he was groaning and sort of said what a whip you are or something and my friend got kind of hurt because it wasn't he was a wimp he was a kind of a tough guy but he, caught that, uh what you're calling a sigh what he was calling a, groan something was going on there something was happening that was better so yeah what's the connection between groaning and chanting at that point then huh uh yeah probably ending up at the same doing the same stuff in a different form i remember your, cartoons about um some guy doing bodybuilding and really enjoying it and some guy doing some other kind of manual labor and really hating it and kind of pointing out it really has a lot to do with your viewpoint, yeah, uh bob uh bob, steve here i actually wasn't gonna say anything tonight because i'm still recovering from knee surgery but since you brought up that last example it kind of touched me you want to groan steve is that where you're heading yes yeah very, after, after surgery i had it out last friday and, apparently i don't know if it was uh the anesthesia, or the oxycodone painkiller but i think it was the anesthesia, i had i had almost non-stop hiccups and gasping for breath, from, when i from then until i came home on wednesday, the knee surgery was great but the other was excruciating but what i found myself having to do was that same kind of thing you get to a place where you just oh you know it's like an opening that has to break away from being locked into this, dynamic level yeah, so that i, just had to bring that up yeah i, think this follows um, the many different forms that we've presented, uh, letting go down time anything dark it's cool uh trading in whatever i got i'm gonna trade it in for something different or brand new or at this level so we have many, words for that we just added a groaning so whichever word or form that you like fine, okay, the easy the eye is a very good one because it starts us distinguishing the difference, uh between the bobby character and something else that's there at first it's but i'm bobby and this sort of wraps so tight uh he can't really distinguish so that ease of the eye helps to i don't know the word delineate catch the difference between the character that's assembled there in his world and this other piece, that is free from can be free from and that one can move much easier faster if we take a 10 pound or a bobby or a one by one we try to move it into a robert, or a uh or a uh two by two, by two uh whatever other one i use uh it can be a little bit of work trying to move this heavy stuff into a finer little confusion there but each of the eye can really move potentially effortlessly quickly it's not really stopped by dimensional walls the nature of it is, is its freedom so i, like that you got a sense of, that i hope that came out right brad said yes so we're okay uh, hello we're still back on any, observations about age in the eye hello out there in the world hi sensei this is justin can you hear me clearly i was experimenting with the connection between breathing as a vehicle for moving into an easier more settled framework and i noticed along the lines of what you said that as my sense of character was softening or unraveling somehow my thoughts and feelings and discomfort in the body would also settle and i felt this a sense of, stillness and peace and um and a sense of not having to work so hard i felt more at ease overall yeah if the easy the eye can bring you to a different level quickly effortlessly and so i think he's saying at a level of being at ease then that level of at ease there will eventually be a character who has a lot of at ease naturally there's more there but, yeah so uh it should get simpler sort of simple introductory patterns is one to two by the three by the bobby the robert and nadeau the whatever forms we use it's a couple of others but once you get the set how it works you can start to move through that i used to use a checkerboard example dumb example uh but i use it a lot back in the day first you go uh one move to the next square to the next square to the next square to the next square and that's how you play the game okay square the square of the square then you reach the end and they king you now the king can move across the board he doesn't have to go one at a time huh the queen in checkers oh, you're back to chess get off the chess game i'm dropping checkers here uh yeah anyway uh so eventually with these simple basics and you get used to them you practice with them a bit eventually it will get faster and now watch out for that word because i don't want you to have an have an awareness about faster and you lose the experience but there's an experiential faster, after a bit but don't mind doing your basics, step at a time get the flavor uh learn the what should we call it ground rules how it works and then fast will, naturally happen uh, i'm still open for any observations you had about easy the eye sensation this is tom um hey um i like what you said about it's this experiential aspect of easy the eye because for me the last time was getting and i know for some people expressed that the i or the focus there expressed a lot of a lot of self-criticism whether it's of the self or the other and easy to eye just represented more of an experience, it, you know i think at the end we were focusing around what, what's really the essence of, this and the experience was for me for me the essential part of easy the eye so since then i've noticed when i'm getting caught up in a spiral of judgment internally for myself or others it's just a sort of taking a basic a breath and centering easy realizing that the experience is, there it's available if i would just allow it to happen um yeah, that was my take from the one yeah i, don't know if i mentioned it in the week at the, friday we were talking about easy the eye but in the insulin days uh, one of my key words and i wasn't making much of it but i would say easy it's a lot of flavor easy and a year later two years later some people come back for a follow-up workshop, and they would tell me that's a magical word and i was like no surprise at first but they were playing with it and when they easied again they're at a different dimension, finer level of everything and so they thought it was a magic word and, i have to suddenly start paying more attention to what that word meant even though i had presented it to them i had to go whoa it's magic for them what's going on here and get into it more and more, so yeah okay yes say something quick sensei if that's okay, for me to easy the eye i almost wrote down my stuff yes okay, um yes for me when you say easy the eye it feels like it's like in the muscle fiber like it's connecting me a little closer to the layer of my muscles it's just settling down and kind of i meet myself there and after a bit the easy the eye will say this is this important thing let me shoot it off and see i will disengage from the body feeling uh there'll be a sense of a body a positioning of a body uh but it's not the body kind of thing so as you continue uh your sense of body as we go more and more and more uh will, change for example physical body to a physical body with an energy flow that you realize there's energy around the body maybe hatha yoga or some beginning tai chi or something or beginning maybe aikido and you continue and then there's an energy body and you continue and it gets finer and finer energy body and you continue and right there eventually the words will have to change i, like the, sense of a field body okay uh, just and yours might be a bit different but anyway just that the, body sense uh is sort of not there but you're still a body within that which in its glow radiation uh radiates through energy body physical body did i blurt out too much there no perfect thank you sensei this is patrick, uh patrick can i call you on your question uh over the weekend or something yeah sure please, yeah for me there's a connection between easy the eye and being here being, present that it's difficult to be present if the eye isn't easy and if, i'm here just here then it's difficult to be sort of busy with you know the eye and the eye sort of taking control over things he said a couple of things there let's see um yeah again all sensei don't go anywhere it's here but it's an inner here finer dimension but it's here okay again not just as an idea but as an actual experience here easy inner finer here okay we tried to show that we're just arm raising okay easy settle open and here the arm moves a bit easier not perfect but noticeably better easy the eye, representing a better level and at a better level oh here it's starting to get there's something moving before my hand moved so yeah here, don't go anywhere it's here we've been affected a lot by the spiritual heaven is up there and uh it was probably good in its day to get people more first aware of finer but then there comes a point where but that's leading people a bit astray it's really good, in this day great but then we need to know sente to come through and say by the way in case you haven't noticed uh it's finer all over here under and upper and upper and under it that's here finer, finer not just up there over there i have to go to heaven, is here finer and finer and finer and finer how are we doing out there people nothing come on sensei i think that's it's great this sort of finer easier easy the eye is almost like a basic of getting one closer to self yes well yes well easy the eye as it continues to easy with itself the word will change and would say we could say i self intermediate here i self and then after a bit self and then whatever words you like i like here i'll give you some, of mine a clearer self uh a more original self yeah, yes and then eventually i'll throw out the word transparent self as my kind of kind of lineage of i to self to finer, finer, and that goes the distance certain things go the distance uh, and uh yeah a center and circle goes a distance one of the original moves someplace was in a center circle layout or maybe a two-fourths layout so two forces the beat of two forces goes the distance, a character finer, finer goes the distance, uh tracking your own qualities well, you're set to catch your own qualities that make you up uh but inner finer they're finer qualities and they can go the distance uh so certain things are, what's the word have longevity have uh ongoing truth to, them i don't know what i'm talking about here somebody stop me before i go mad maybe the words are they're fundamental truths they're, axioms they apply across general cases they're not a one-off they're universal, observations uh thank you how is that does this fit in now i'm not sure i'm going to use the template, uh, katja, what's the bush camilla, do you know you have camellias in front of your porch thank you let me know yeah okay thank you okay one bush produces yellow they're just coming out now and there's yellow camellias, this other bush produces red comedians you just hang out and you'll learn something gotcha jesus where am i going now you screwed me up here uh, that, how the bush itself works that it needs soil and has its downtime and regrowth uh that's the same for the yellow or the red or the red so you each have your own color scheme but what we're trying to lay out and learn, trying to use some good words there you have to remind me again lauren but there are basics of the, bush itself, that are basics for everybody now within that, we're going to have yellow and red and add two we're gonna have roses and whatever, apple trees and all that stuff so, but you're still within yeah yes so a lot of our work is just trying to present basic laws so you've got sort of a reference now who you are in the reference hey that's you i'm not telling you to be nado i'm not i'm not telling you to be nado i'm not telling you to be an aikido teacher god forbid uh, but in following the proper patterns you can realize you whatever the right words are here experience you be to be the finer of you yeah within a certain type of structure so as best as we can understand the structure of creation we're trying to lay that out best we can okay ah that was a lot said hey out there this is joanna um i was hungry i had some recently some uh stressful situations um that i tried to do a couple of uh games uh one by one two by two three by three i really felt better uh to deal with the situations but recently i noticed that i felt better and then i respond to the to the other person that was related in this situation, but i wasn't responding to myself and then when i was over this situation i got back to myself and the stressful the pressure it was still there so i don't know if i did the, full job or if i or if i did half of the practice but um i deal better with the situation maybe, maybe he hit a better level okay but a one by two by game when you're dealing with somebody right there and then sounds a bit it's a good practice uh but not when i'm active uh that's why easy of the i being can be faster anyway just that aside uh that you hit a better place i thought you said and then when you were finished you moved out of that better place back to your original norm you move back into your body yes exactly so and people have come up with this before, can we sustain this better can we can we sustain this better can we i know for like a words hold it better and yes again with a little practice and again, more the experience of it not just the awareness of it if you are aware of it good but it'll dissipate really fast if you have a memory of it, dissipates really fast, so part of the awareness its partner is the experience and as you get that down more the experience it has more longevity it'll last for quite a while not forever but quite a while yeah and maybe the situation is because it's dealing with longevity it's uh family stuff and it's anyway it's, long process trying to do in a different way right now since i have been doing this these classes with you for almost two years as lauren said in the beginning so it's kind of uh shifting this, period of or practicing of practicing of trying different practices or different games could be easy the eye could be down time whatever but still anyway it still needs more work but uh i was wondering yeah oh sensei said he he's still trained and he didn't mean falling on the mat what was he training i still train not comparing myself a little sensei but i still train i'm still plugging along and opening up for it so hey of course, okay thank you the people that want this magic thing to happen where oh uh what's the spiritual word she's just not on tonight is, it satori, yes i got it all right now because i had this flash uh questionable people very questionable people very questionable let's not even get into that it's a it's an exercise it's kind of like a daily exercise okay anyway blah, and one more oh hell i lost you one second let me when we asked for comments and i got one well two uh patrick i'll get to yours on the phone uh for the things i'd like to hear more about or things i need to work on list letting go of who you are on one level to be able to move into the next level okay so far basics letting go of bobby to move into the level that mixes produces robert don't go away don't go away what'd you do, shh i'm sorry i'm not very good at this here it is here it is i'm feeling a little stuck or hitting a plateau in a few areas and, wondering, if my attachment to the security of the familiar might be part of what's keeping me stuck this is it's answering its own questionnaire i think i'm wondering if my attachment is keeping me stuck there why this transition to the next better doesn't happen yeah so we have a variety of things uh let go of those things you're hanging on to you know you're hanging on to things i mean i'm bobby in bobby's world of course i'm hanging on to things okay i got rent to pay next month that's going to throw in a little and the donations aren't coming in sorry, uh easy down time die out i used to practice dying, that was my form of running around with down timing so i practiced dying and then dying bobby's worries but i got to pick up my laundry next week bobby you're dying you don't give a about that, and you'd let it go and whatever you'd let it go because you were dying things that were important as bobby weren't so important now you're dying so i practiced dying on my couch in tokyo it was a fun day and anyway so i think your own question is being answered here uh i, would uh yeah as you as you hang out and ask and open and easy uh the intelligence of the system uh in your system ought to start to show and point out yes, so easy the eye letting go down timing trading in whatever style is comfy for you whatever words do it for you be prepared for a change of words that you continue finer and finer but other than that sure but i think you're starting to answer your own question okay how are we doing people we all alert and alive out there hi roger that suspense is killing us oh you're waiting for magic you better change channels the sponge the bowl of water okay now i don't know how to do this let me just first go around on this let's see okay, so you're in your bobby or robert you're two by three by your a fair day good day great day and whatever and you sit settle easy open easy the eye that's you easily how you move into a different dimension okay here we go we're starting to enter this and we'll have a sense of being a little uh roomier, in some form or other okay, yeah and yeah and continue, to settle to settle easy open because we want you to go deeper in you have the ability of hovering over and being aware of it and in your awareness get some feeling from it therefore you think you're experiencing ah careful okay we need full experience okay not just a, close by oh i can kind of get a sense of it that's it i'm out of here has to know a little bit how the game works, okay easy the eye is the eye you enter a different realm a different dimension inner finer level of you inner dimension okay, so here you are now this water is not water anymore it's an uh the next, whatever finer energy dimension, okay it'll show either earlier finer energies you might feel the hum of it or something, a little bit more and the quality so we picked that up i think a couple weeks ago uh i believe uh some people uh, uh i think florida amy was bringing up uh in the family of love what, were i forget what word amy used uh appreciation though uh, anyway it was in the family of love uh somebody else brought up i've got it i remember i remember calmness we all did calmness as a group practice one, time okay so as you become as you eat of the eye enter into this next larger you know you're in the bowl and as you continue to easy you want to get stuck on being aware all right again that's too soft and it's easy to get pushed back out now the words we've used historically are, of acetyl is a good one settle, ground and i can't use a lot of ground, and i can't use a lot of ground uh roots uh roots since you like the word roots take root there go deeper take roots, what we're doing with those words is continuing in that field of energy easy and continuing to settle okay now we're starting to get more experience when we were here we were aware of it okay and again i have to say careful because your awareness you think you're experiencing it i would give you 10 15 maybe for some people 20 experience just to make this up, but we need a full [Music], deeper, experience yes you were aware now its partner is the experience the experience of it okay and as you uh as you fuller experience fuller experience easy the eye fuller experience okay now with that fuller of experience through that sponge okay, under there i'm just holding it up for you can see but through that sponge which is fully yeah full it's been fully soaking, the character will begin to show so here's all your qualities the water the sponge is aware of them and then goes deeper more open and begins to really, experience really, really experience okay as you're as you're open there open there hang out there continue to experience the character that's there through that sponge like the words right now through that sponge can begin to show okay and again and again the character will be more balanced in his world center circle and there's still an easy the eye that's here that's a different component okay so there's better characters not oh that's me that's me no that's a character they come and go okay, i'm an i self i'm an easy be okay, if you're suddenly to erase bobby pour acid on him and he totally disappears i still exist as an as a i self okay this has an high self might be a little trauma there for a moment, uh but soon the same pattern will happen quite likely a big dark and then you uh level you're at opens up and you're in some astral plane let's say, okay depending on you how far you, you get with this did i say too much am i confusing the out of you anyway, basically the sponge theory is just a reminder, to soak to soak and again and again to sort of know how it works a bit so when you first see it that's nice good it's a percentage game continue easing the i hit them again or open or open start to feel a little bit a little bit good, easily i continue to open uh, at that dimensional level world you're in fuller presence there fuller presence there at that level fuller and fuller as you get fuller and fuller character will begin to show and ease of the eye you're ready to move on to the next one if, you want to continue or that one's pretty cool you might want to hang out there for a while okay, did i lose you is this is this too, simple for you sensei thank you for saying that it's a percentage game two always it always might be 100 but it but it maybe the character will show as it progresses in that situation but it's a percentage you see the negative type people for example uh will hit it once and it's not perfect and so they'll ah that's no good and they'll walk away from the practice even though that first beat had a little something the negative them won't buy it what a shame what a shame what a shame say my on a heavy date if you did not go boom, okay the shoulders tightening a bit really catching my attention easy, in first a better level and from that better level okay it still felt this a bit now if i'm really negative it's like oh it's not right yet because my shoulders i can still feel my shoulder but if i fine-tune it much less shoulder feeling than the first one and within there was also a bit of effortlessness a bit okay and you continue it's a percentage game so don't just do one uh when you're practicing uh hang out with it hang out with it i mean aikido you don't do one technique you stay with the same technique for minimum 15 minutes okay i think in tokyo we normally would do, for a class 15 minutes each or yeah, practice, it's okay practice yeah sensei this is justin you, mentioned before our break our last break that um you mentioned the rule of five yeah same thing you hitting it once doesn't, produce the kind of immersive experience that it takes to, really soak in something but come at it again a rule of thumb and i on that note um as you, know i work with, with clients i provide some therapy too some people that are that this process introduced to that are having panic attacks you know as a percentage in that frame with that frame of reference it's not obvious enough with one or two deep breaths or something they settled to such a limited degree that it's not obvious and they would it doesn't work but if you if you hang out with it like you've suggested for a little while then even a person with the most intense level of panic comes back you send her again yeah they're like oh yeah okay but you got to hit it like you've said it the human condition so i like the way you said there's something about they just do a little bit it's not obvious so they're like yeah a little bit they do another one that's a little bit that's a human condition especially in the heaviers that that's what they tend to do they won't allow themselves to really boom, all right all right so at first you at the level of working with people that you work with those kind of people do the best you can with them as long as they're moving along as long as you're doing something where they will eventually hit a much noticeable level where they say oh thank you doctor wow kind of thing yeah uh something else that you said was nice um, oh, uh, yeah it's like the if we use idea body in its truer sense it's not my idea and here's the body but that pattern the great concept of creation based on and all the stuff that uh responds back as its partner through the whole damn universe creation uh that the idea part seems very fast but the response it's not that it's dumber, or whatever it's just it's nature it seems slower and it seems like it needs five pumps to one idea or whatever number you want to make up okay uh, and we have to i don't know live with that for a while accept it play with it use it use it use it if i say okay i want to uh stand better on this ideal one stand i want to stand better okay boom being, the message is heard by its partner and it starts to gather its forces i, can feel it some swirling going on around here sense feel uh okay easy is it time yet, getting close here it comes not bad not bad but not perfect i'm not a perfect stander yet i'm not even full as a standard i mean i came up strong and kind of fast but not, yet continue if you want to repeat that again, the idea ah there i like that one it felt fuller and uh and it was kind of a little more gracious in its fullness wasn't weaker but this graciousness was there in its fullness, uh, and i, like playing with the pump if you want to remind yourself what you're doing, that's fine but we're increasing, the allowance of the, stuff that responds the body of it if you would whatever words you, like energies stuff, the male energies of creation i, kind of think of the idea as the female and this has the male but whichever, whichever form you do try to stay up on your own pattern don't switch around to don't, confuse you in your own system, so if i say male you may say no, that's female that's fine stick to your own pattern until your own system may correct you may not you might be fine for you okay so don't get stuck in exactly, certain words you know and don't get too stupid human on me is god male or female out of this thing seems like what i've heard is two forces come out of it okay, and you need to get a creation going so don't get stupid human on i know you're female no, no males what republican no, it's a god's democrat no come on knock it off people anyway we're in hell hello out there am i driving you crazy tonight what sponge, sponge, to, soak, i used to call in, the dough to sometimes slurpee if i'd be standing oh okay here we go uh easy slurp it up it's, a it's a slurpee it's just like there's a giant straw here or something all that stuff's coming up through the body and, then hey, hey now i'm a little stronger a little more vibrant a little, responsive whatever words you think you have the right sense of it so that's, the slurpee where the hell are we help, essentially this is lauren and uh one thing i notice about the sponge in the sponge theory is that sponge has gone through easy the eye process, and ended up through constant pumping all the way down laying on the water and you showed how the sponge soaks up water how the self soaks up qualities yeah and in that process with the addition of deeper continue this sense of death grounding rooting go ahead sorry at that at that the sponge is supported by the water without, effort, it has a buoyancy in its existence and, the sponge is soaking especially with water in your example but qualities without effort it's its nature to soak up the thing that it's supported by yeah okay can i throw to be careful here of course both words that you use uh were like well if i just sit on top of the water let's see if you can remember your words it'll naturally soak up, for the awareness people i, sort of can't allow that i may say oh, i know i mean the bowl i, sense feel it oh it's all going to naturally happen right there we may have a problem i'm aware it's supposed to naturally happen i understand how sponges work it should naturally happen i would continue opening and going deeper i said involve yourself i don't i don't know the words i don't want to get too busy here but stay active continue with the depth then the opening i, i don't want the awareness folks to, have a reason to stay with the awareness sorry i have to keep going over that over and over but it's goddamn critical it's an ancient mistake that's still going on so that's why i just wanted to be careful with the words bob can i jump in oh here comes kenny tangent yeah i mean i'm with the tangent okay well actually you, brought it i think you brought it there already so um you know one of the slides lauren shows uh the osensei slides talks about failure is the key to success and that one has always really caught me um and, i think i'm going through a phase of trying to fail my way to success and, it is about the eye right so the, failure of success is you has a lot to do with who's judging it which eye is looking at it and then i think this process of going through the finer dimensions um, is, how we, extract more learning more knowledge more development out of what we called a failure or a success is that um and also can we change uh metaphors and, let's say uh i go back to the uh plant theory i have to sort of warm up on the plant theory because patrick in switzerland is going to interview me about the plant theory in a week or two anyway uh potted plant potty plant there yeah uh we covered that one friday night right you're all fresh with potted plant theory, uh, so where am i going when it reaches its extreme or can't go anymore it's been doing great and then suddenly and it's starting to fade a bit yeah, it's an opportunity to go deeper meaning a shift of dimensional thing and, the eye is at a different level in there and it produces the next stronger plant or that plant that's now more alive in the proper season however you want to say yeah, that's great that's good yeah, uh so i think sensei's pointing at that if it doesn't work how cool because it really helps you to develop if you know sort of how it works it didn't work oh let me go a bit deeper i i'm saying i'm hungry go ahead you always talked about how uh if, the first technique didn't work in the class he might step off and, do his uh his spiral right his thing yeah, yeah, you see i what i saw was he did something different than the norm the norm would be to stay in the physical and, work it out do some more and, and or slow it down so you catch it and catch it and he didn't do any of that outside stuff he did something that had nothing to do with that obvious or obviously a say and he did something that was more so within his own thing and then boom it's all gonna work okay where are we nope, the reason say this is patrick what destruction what struck me about the sponge is that as it absorbs it expands so, there's the drawing in quality but there's also the kind of filling up and extending out quality that is kind of inextricably linked with it yeah and we even see that a bit in the human condition somebody who's special boom they light up the room uh when schwarzenegger a friend of mine was at was at an affair with fortunately he was there and said it was kicky he'd walk across the room and the crowd that had been surrounding him would walk across the room and stay crowded around him he walked across and he'd already be there again, boom there's something that, they were, partaking of soaking up uh but they thought it was like wow watch that happen wherever he'd go the crowd was just gonna follow but we all have seen and felt people who were a little special they were on that day or they're just special people and they light up the room so yes there isn't a an uh, an expanse don't we have work like he's bigger than life or no i hope larger than life yeah he's, he's showing bigger than the norm i mean the norm is this size who the hell is this guy because he, just senses bigger uh did i cut you off patrick no that's what i wanted to say yeah so yeah, um bob man yeah who that richard, richard, yeah uh yeah uh well i just was thinking about you know uh the example i, was thinking of was terry's story uh hang on he had so many which one oh the old man on the train yeah okay and um uh the thing is i'm saying okay so terry's sitting there he sees this drunk the drunk's threatening terry's ready to use his physical whatever you call it martial arts yeah all of it and, this old man, sees the drunk in another dimension and touches the drunk in another dimension completely neutralizes any power the guy has in the physical dimension by being in this other dimension does this touch at all where we're in the area we're pointing towards uh, i don't know nice sorry uh so let's surmise that this uh old man [Applause], had a say caring this may make a board we don't know but let's make up a word that he had caringness or understanding within his color scheme and he tapped that so that old man with his caring and understanding approached the drunk listened to him ended up holding him whatever, uh, that they were there so what, did uh, uh terry get out of this that there's other ways of handling things and just being a martial artist i, don't know though the way terry writes it or wrote it what he got from it was that the old man diffused the situation with compassion and more completely diffused it than terry would have ever confused uh settled it by you know confronting and so and so he took that lesson well to me it was this shift into another dimension that's that i thought resonated with where you were going that's kind of more what was important about at this point was that the old man could see the energy of this being in a in a place that terry looking through the physical dimension couldn't and that shift whatever moving towards that shift was that you know when i get into it with someone i can't let go of it either and i, could see you know for terry that he was trying to do that but the old man saw something completely different and transformed the game and i don't know he seemed to me that it was like he was saying this was what jose was trying to teach us and i, finally saw it in this other way or something i don't know really where terry was at well i don't know also maybe it might depend on the situation or maybe some situation where somebody's got to be tough there okay there is a, job for warriors okay, and sometimes got to be a warrior all right in that case terry saw somebody who was better at inner finer character whatever uh um that's not just warrior, warrior there are other attributes potential within everybody's system um go ahead i'm looking at the dichotomy of you know this idea that oh sensei was talking about love and throwing people on the ground you know what was the magic of that tremendous yin and there's a certain level of harmony when you're at that level experiencing actually present in a world actually present that all the forces harmonize it's not so much he threw them they, got thrown it's happening okay i don't know if i see potentially a dichotomy or some difference there i'd see interesting and hard for the human being reminds me when i was in high school and i said to my judo teacher wow you're a tough guy uh something about uh fighting, exactly how i worded it and he looked at me said i don't fight now i'm a 16 year old kid or something he's like nah here's a tough guy paratrooper world war ii judo guy really pretty good and he doesn't fight he doesn't talk about fighting he doesn't think about fighting how can that be in my 16 year old mind, it's a bit of a shock anyway i don't know where i'm going with that i'm there the, time when i said to the guy would you ever use it on the street he said all the time i said really what happened he said well nothing because i used it the right way anyway sorry go ahead i'm, waiting for great insights about easy the eye and about oh soaking sponge deeper fuller and through that fuller, something more, should show through there the character will show through now the character will be in his centered circled world at a better level and then we can proceed whenever you're ready to proceed we'd easy the eye again to continue through dimensionality okay inner finer dimensionality sensei um, tom, yeah, i'm looking at the bowl and the sponge and over the last 15 minutes 10 minutes and i keep seeing a container and i see a sponge that has a limited quad, capacity to soak up those qualities before it starts oozing out i know in, my business i see water getting into a building it gets to a saturation point and then it's flowing it's it get whenever matter gets to a saturation point then what's saturating it starts to flow from that thing out and so it's coming manifesting those qualities out into saturation and what happens i, like that saturation yeah talking about a fuller experience that's what i was trying to get with the fullness of wet the fullness of wet not just a bit of it not just put your toes in it wet that's not experiential enough okay, uh it's that real and, that needs a little practice to get really a good sense for that so that every dimension you're at you have the capability of having that same sense for it so you don't miss out on it and shift into major awareness which will dissipate too fast if there's something lacking as beautiful as the awareness can see there's something not quite there there's something not quite there okay yeah which i'll sense i was trying to show i want to soak to a point where it's actually saturated to the point where it's emitting those qualities rather than it gets beyond the soaking yeah and yeah and it you know in this um chicken practice i used to do or i'd still do now and again, the bowl is it's not a container it's, uh it's, uncontained and the sponge has an unlimited capacity for, soaking in those qualities to a point where, those qualities start to become manifest, and, so hold it down go, back on me uh, why can't we have, a bowl representing a certain dimensional level if you continue finer there'll be a sense of more room in a certain way the bowl is bigger so in moving through dimensions of the sense that it's bigger okay it's not a confining thing it's a adjusting to your location positioning okay positioning it helps you position instead of roaming around and you're sort of aware but you're you can't produce or, something's missing helping you position here and now yes stay in the here and now but be finer and it'll eventually emanate or i like your words uh gushing out the other way it'll, instead of soaking it starts to manifest those qualities yeah we're going beyond the soaking now yeah so if, our quality here is uh nice, whatever and you're really, soaked and following your layout uh there will be a certain point of soaking in nice energy niceness where the character will just naturally be nice you won't have to think about being nice he just is nice it exudes niceness instead of i have to i have to have an idea that i'm a nicer person or you say to somebody i'm nice and they say no you're not and you whoa why are you screwing me up here why are why are you screwing me up here why are you being mean well because there's no exuding they have an idea about nice but they're not this is not actually radiating there anyway i like your words um this is kind of going back to what you talked about i guess earlier today um today um so no level 1 i level 2i level 3i um [Music], wondering if, i were to describe the experience of moving through the levels as like the structure is disintegrating and then a new structure were to take its place as like to illustrate the journey throughout the levels would that be a i guess a correct way have you done a one by two by three by yes, okay i think it lays out there i think so you know when buying is kind of tight right yeah and you got crazy thoughts and you're pissed at everybody and you and you're pissed at everybody and you can't do anything really easy you traded in your down time you did something, you're moving into a two by two at first it's not clear maybe a vague sense of sense of making more room uh maybe the first sense was i it's dark i, i nothing's going on there i better go back to my one by one and beat that guy again because ain't nothing here, okay, but as you hang out in the two by two easy, easy it begins to show what's there okay begins to show what's there ah, usually again more room some sense of energy is in some form or a sense of qualities and we'd hang out there and then they begin to mix we'll do a slower form they mix up and down and all around and they mix up a two by two and he's, a bit better the thoughts that were in a one by one mind don't exist at that same level the one by one guy doesn't want to walk out of his apartment it's dangerous out there, the two by two he may say oh it's beautiful to go out what a beautiful day i don't know what he's going to do what do you experience it but isn't it all in that one by two by three by i think i think whatever you're heading for is in there but maybe i missed something go ahead continue it kind of feels like um i mean forgive the metaphor but it's like uh like uh it's like you have a little tiny church it's tiny it's quaint and then for some reason it gets destroyed collapse whatever but then a much more beautiful bigger more accommodating larger size church fills right in its repeat the process and then sooner or later it becomes a cathedral whatever i'm just yeah i'm fine are you using buildings as a reference yeah i'm using building reference i've been through there it goes way back i haven't seen them lately but i, used to get that whatever i forget what, before that and whatever happened after but yeah i had building show as a reference yeah, thank you cincinnati hey can i speak since mark from new zealand if you speak in american english [Laughter], or quote let's do your best yeah i'll try that's right um going back to the sponge and, also uh kenny's, failure uh failure joining those two together i, find if you if i haven't soaked long enough and something happens i'll go screaming back to where i was yes, yes yeah, no that's the law if you're not grounded there if you're not for like the words embodied there yes yeah, yeah, yeah and um and, and there's sort of uh for me there's, been learning in that because, uh in that failure i'm saying oh hang on what happened uh that other guy would have been so much better to deal with whatever happened then yeah so, and then you got shot back into the lesser you yeah, yeah, yeah so just having that experiencing even that, failure was actually a really good learning it's like, hang on what are you doing the other guy would have done it better yeah the, more the guy who soaked longer yeah yes because he get roots like even though he's not a physical body or a tree anymore but he'd have the roots diana florida on, i am i am yes i'm here your observation way back in the day in little grounding or something and, you looked at me in that class and you said you're doing something different than the other people apparently in my grounding i was putting my feet in stirrups or i, had a ground connection you remember you brought it up don't bring up things you're not going to remember 50 years later what's with you i mean i would i would say it now i mean you do, something different or do you i mean your whole teaching is sharing with us what you do i mean that's what you're attempting to do right hopefully so that you can do this yeah the important piece so you can do uh so you can do you yes uh, to be the glorious you that we all know is there and it's available to the lesser you whatever defeat, anyway uh just this sense of roots uh a better sense of the experience of depth and i was just trying to have her remember because she said it looks like your feet are in stirrups or uh bolted down whereas other people just sort of had something going down but they weren't bolted down and she pointed that out i was like oh let me check this out and that's what we're sort of talking about with the more of the experience the depth will help this sense of roots will help that's why no sense they like the word that's why uh chinese martial artists passed away noah bruce lee thank you bruce lee loved the roots so without root you guys are all because there's no actual beingness there, okay so at whatever level very important and continue with them because it goes on it goes the distance this, sense of depth which will take care of the height and the height will touch the depths and that so anyway blah, blah ah so uh soaking experiential uh and don't mind if it takes a little more time that's the one to five really means don't, mind if, it takes a little more time to experience it's okay it's just how it works, again later with practice and practice it probably get much, faster but don't worry about speed because i don't, worry about speed because i don't want you to have an idea about speed and yourself and not really be actually, actually, okay what we don't need is spiritual bullshitters kind of thing i think we have a few out there in the world, unfortunately uh we don't need more uh we're eating up time so anything to hi it's justin again i just wanted to share some thoughts maybe a brief comment on your use of the bowl and the water and this, ability to or this maybe a recommendation to practice most often when it's easy you see that the bowl and the water are very steady and it's easy to soak yourself in it it's like learning to swim in a pool versus learning to swim in a stormy sea you know where a wipeout is a white belt but you might not throw them in with multiple attackers on day one practice a lot and it's easy so that uh you know you can without feeling um preoccupied maybe as a character immersing into we can hang out with it longer somehow, yeah, if i'm following you know if i heard you uh but i was thinking about something to today, uh about uh a particular person in particular situation but of how you can take a particular situation that could uh because of the energies that are going on there put you in a tizzy where you uh run around about this situation that happened or almost happened or something and you're like and that's kind of fun you're in a tizzy tizzying other people we're instead of doing that and nothing wrong it's a human thing to do instead of huh now let me replay that what how could i have settled and open what were the energies trying to do who would i eventually be in that situation, uh to use that as a practice now whether i tizzy or say no i think i'll practice with this, that's, that's, what that's your call you have a choice and it's also judging i got to be careful not to say a negative thing here but, it's also where we separate out maybe the true seekers for the dilettantes they'd rather go into the tizzy for a while, instead of hmm let me let me let me let me hit this a different way did i sort of say that right yeah and i know on hard cases where the energies are on stuff not the easiest thing in the world and if you can't do it at the moment replay it wasn't created by rca or whoever, you can replay and those energies will all be there again as you replay okay so if you say well that guy almost ran me over in the car yesterday so therefore i got a lot of energy what were the energies trying to do and you can replay them and the energies that were there uh when the guy almost ran you over are here now you can replay the ability to replay exists in the creation otherwise we wouldn't have that invention capability on your damn tv set it already exists in its own form in the universe so you can replay yeah so, anyway tizzy choose to do this if it's too much or whatever, choose to do this the next day or whatever i like that pattern by the way i think we're getting close to the end people, and we are sensei i want to thank you very much for sponge theory okay, and uh and uh fantastic on anyway uh i, think dennis creatus better watch out uh now i got to go wash dishes you know so anybody else have any last comments for sensei or sponges and so sensei i think we're we've reached the end i think i'm still absorbing the concept ah was that a play on words here some humor trying to come out over there do i need a new writer he's trying to squeeze every last drop out of it out of it i'm out of here people thank you thank you see you next week thank you thank you sensei thank you thank you thank you bob thank you sensei thank you thank you um yeah because what

## Healing Possibilities

**Date:** Unknown date  
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSGtDdyJdJs

and so uh i think we're uh we're almost ready and uh as soon as uh sensei uh turns on his camera we should be ready to go thank you all for coming or there and uh sensei uh good evening you are on sensei thank you very much thank you good evening everybody [Music], okay, same old story taking another angled slant on it okay the major layout doesn't change but how we approach it uh what we use to help us continue navigate into finer and finer that can vary okay but the basic map if you would of creation, uh pretty much is the basic map okay, healing, healing possibilities all right uh we've covered some of the things a bit um, so we mentioned the story of it happened in the early days in aikido remember uh with a lot of skiers at the time and they would break their own skiing and but we're also doing a bit of energy flow, uh in, class and uh and uh so it was not unusual it happened more than a few more than a couple of times at least a few times where the doctor uh said wow your bone is healing fast and he got to the point where i expected the doctor to say that with any of my aikido students who had broken their arm healing faster than the norm kind of thing okay so what is that based on [Applause] another story here i like rotator cuff tears uh okay so i've been tore up a bit uh one time i had a very bad tear and rotated can't lift your arm you can't pour a pot of coffee which was horrible can't do that can you see me do that adjust the drink jam outside screen there we go there we go ah so i'm just fighting around in class and there was a an aikido guy there who's a physical therapist and of course i can't move my arm but i settle, basic, into a little finer energy dimension no big deal just fairly quick one adam and in that energy dimension i thought whatever i raised my arm i did a couple of fancies and he said you're not supposed to be able to do that well in my normal physical level i can't but easy and subtle and get to an energy dimension, pretty close one and, from that level ken could do things okay for a while so following that trajectory following that trajectory following that path so basic settle easy, the eye facilitates opening up so that you're moving into a, finer inner but remember these lines here are inner lines and not out there lines when you're inner you might have some a better sense about there but the, process work we do is inner dimensional into finer vibration rates into the fuller of that okay, uh so you had practice with a one by two by two three buy had a pretty good sense of that i think i want to present some different possibilities uh, okay so one of them might be uh let me stand oh okay the basic there we go uh the basic energies of energies down we've uh touched on it some classic each other it's an easy cell [Applause] with a sense there are energies that move up and down or if you like move down and up okay whatever is your first preference easy settle energies from a little bit deeper moving up and back down you don't stay with just the idea but i need an idea to get started but the energies that move up is a after a bit more of a sense feeling ah they seem to be stopping about here you see they go down seem to be stopping about my uh feet flat feet on the rug level okay so boom okay so at the level i'm at now that's where the up and down energies are moving okay as you play with sense experiencing uh you get to measure your own in whatever form it's again easy for you comfortable for you now here on this first simple centered body approach kind of thing as the energies up and down are more in harmony or balance with each other that's the up and down sense of balance and again with little practice you get to feel oh yeah that level of balance feels better than five minutes ago or whatever at a level of balance the energies are free, therefore there's a bit of a natural ah, emanation, outflow, let me check my system right now where i'm at okay i i'm starting to smile a bit no reason to smile like this is happening and a real desire to straighten a bit as if something is pushing me straighter ah a little bit more i'm here not fantastic i'm here but more i'm here than a couple of minutes ago, okay so what i'm presenting, is, balanced energies at their balance point a natural emanation through that heavier i'm doing inner finer, but they outflow through the heavier that's why i can feel my skin glow after a while for example or my body is affected because it wants to straighten a bit ah it feels better as if i was in a one by one space before now i'm in a two by two kind of thing oh yeah, yeah, hmm, okay, so, first simple set, centered energies up and down the center and as you go as you continue you'll naturally move into a little better level where the energy sense feel that they're coming up from deeper and, and, coming down from, higher up down at the same time for me because i'm playing with the center uh the post, pipeline that's here that feels a little fuller if you look forward check the things i notice tells me i'm moving along and this level of energy is up energy's down there and i play with those energies up and down for a while uh let me measure it my way for you energy's up seem to be about up here okay, energy's down earlier was at my feet level now down yeah a feeling as a human being i'd say like my feet are six inches to a foot under the ground yeah if i was standing outside i'd say yes my feet are in the ground okay so my beat is getting fuller up and down now there's a balance here soon it should show energy's up energy's down and they should be balanced easy to down here we go okay i think i got a balanced place it just feels like a balanced place a sense fear and the, from that balance there's a natural emanation, make up that word for now emanation out through the heavier touches my body i feel a little stronger if we were throwing punches boom, i'd let you punch me a bit not your best shot yet but you could you could throw a shot at me just for fun i'd take it for dumb example sorry energy is down energy is easy now someplace in there [Applause], they come to a balance i feel fuller ah i feel fuller my desire to move out a bit more like this it's natural i'm not making it up it's what my ah, and that sound is natural i'm not making it up ah that's what it wants to do ah just emanating more out through the body, ah, okay yeah we've and remember, remember, remember, it's not just an idea there has to be some inner sense experience, it's not an idea oh yes harmony in my body up and down oh yeah not a hell of a lot is going to happen okay so yes an idea and then and then the actual forces energies in this case that are moving up and down that having some room to move in easy, settle open have more room to move in they'll naturally balance with each other, are we okay so far okay, um and it's up to you once you got the sense of the game to keep playing the game, okay so see if there's next for you where or maybe the if you're getting a pipeline type thing it shows a bit different, for example for me often it would show from a metal pipe to a sort of a plastic clearer pipe where i can feel sense see the energy is moving up through that clearer plastic pipe okay, but then it goes down deeper and therefore higher so the height is depth and you get to the height there are partners set up there okay, and as the energies are balanced at the balance point i'm saying there's a natural emanation sure was we could add things later like at the balance point there is a core and we'll do that after a bit core work on the healing format and we say if there's a core of your energies mixing somewhat there ah then there's also a character i mentioned soap that a sponge character comes right through there after a bit so, can the character just sort of presents itself shows itself here okay like a happening am i getting too far ahead right now ah the energy beats of up and down [Applause], and that was of sensei's first major and by playing there a lot he developed a very powerful body he got strong, fast from being a sickly kid uh he got very strong okay was a long teenager he's doing feats of strength uh very fast development but he was basically working that pattern okay in his form of doing that pattern but basically centered character energies up and down making a stronger character, ah, all right all right so in that sense he went from being a sickly kid to a very strong teenager it's kind of a type of healing we could say, okay, jump in give me something to hold on here before we move along somebody any comments here yeah so um when you were talking about healing and um, uh, changing and things i, felt a sense of like um magnetic and being uh as a healer feeling like it's okay to feel magnetic and to draw out stuff but not retain it would you speak something about that okay we're jumping ahead a bit okay yeah okay let's start simple first okay possibly you could feel magnetism with the up and down forces it's like one's a he and the other is a she simple approach don't confuse that with boy girl just girl just uh but one is has that sense and the other has the other sense okay, and as there's more room for them to activate and be present you might feel a real, draw from one to the next they're hot for each other okay yeah and all the way down the line uh things get very sexy i got my front yard and the blue jays are chasing each other around and then the doves and they always travel in pairs okay so there's this attractive force okay yeah uh original, okay so it seeps through everything anyway um, uh you're talking about being a healer i'm going to play with self-healing okay gonna be i'll go all sick people come at me screw you keep your crutches outside my house i'm not ready for you people, okay, yeah, good, good, good yeah, i don't have a big tent down in georgia, you following underground i know i hear you i hear you that's good that's good i'm not there i'm kind of a person, yep personal so, okay here here's a good one um when you were talking ab you often talk about like you know when you're um uh the hands of uh you know when you're when you feel that sense of, your hands being alive there's a natural attraction magnetism between the hands and then putting that across your own body i mean as far as yoga is concerned for me that's where it's a lot about is like a sense of self massage and moving the energy within my own body and i feel like that's, uh what you're more about what you're talking about right it's like don't worry about anyone else check out yourself yeah, i think since they said that in all those write-ups before class started clean your own act up first, don't try to clean up other people's act take care of yourself first yeah fantastic yeah thank you but yeah the hand things at a certain level of settling finer dimension easy settle and, you know there's energy's emanating you can feel them actually and you're practicing seeing you can see them with a little darker background proper lighting or no lighting kind of thing you can see this, thing going back and forth it looks like white streaks at first a little bit better and you feel oh my god it's repulsing here oh it's drawing and what whatever you feel the magnetism of it there's just natural happening at a certain level okay just, at a admiration i just want to say that one of the best gifts that you've ever given me, was to say was to say imagine you can see something and you and you then you demonstrate and then you say imagine you can see something i mean i've seen that i've heard that over the years and it's like the every time when you say that more and more and more is revealed yeah it's expo it's exposed for what it is yeah, and everybody can see things better if they settle and do the basics and get to a finer dimension and right there, are many possibilities yeah okay one is seeing the same situation but at this level you see it different, yep, okay they remember the story as in hopefully an example betsy's father was a doctor and he was leading group of interns through the ward and they stopped at one bed like they do check them out and he was very angry with the young interns because he said can you see this guy's got a headache and nobody saw that and he got a little hurt at them it's like what the hell level i'm making this up now what level are you looking at this guy yeah can't you see which is probably a bad word can't you sense feel see he has a headache right you can use you can you can use the word if you want compassion i don't need that word stay on track here don't add fancy word oh yes we're talking screw that here self healing boom don't throw me off with your fancy ass words sean words sean don't, amaze me and wow me without fancy words that's fraud click, click, let's get there experientially and then i'll listen get you i'm not interested in draw at work anyway well uh okay, thank you sean and i tried to uh [Applause], i mentioned this lady friend i had met at esslin and she was a veterinarian and i was pretty good with dogs i was still carrying over a lot of dog stuff in those years uh so i had a fair good eye fair good eye for dogs but she could see things in dogs that was beyond me you know okay, okay so i told you the story of a little we were walking by a house on excellent property and there was a dog out in the yard and we well then you're having a glance at it and said oh the kids are riding on its back its back is in and i looked and i couldn't see a bad back i've got a fair good eye okay i couldn't see if i wanted to check her out she was a new connection so i went back and knocked on the door and talked to the lady at the house about the dog and i said did you know your dog has a bad back waiting for some she said oh yeah the kid's right on it i tell him not to but i said damn not only did you know he had a bad back she knew why good eye had must have been a hell of a vet so you just spot things in from a finer dimension you see things other people can't see okay now we're bringing the healers after a bit uh susan would say yes uh elaine would probably say yes uh florida, amy, no daphne no daphne diane, justin, justin, seemed to be in florida braintails are going anyway so again we're going at the same old story but i thought because of the age many of you are at and the shape you're in that the healing thing might catch your attention and draw some interest okay uh i could say baseball uh but we'd only have one steve from l.a would tune in but nobody else would so healing is interesting to a lot of people especially at a certain ah okay healing so the up and down basic two beat energy finer and finer and finer fuller and fuller and fuller any place of uh balance, and again if you're since feeling experiencing you can tell where that balance is you can you can feel the balance some form okay uh, such a simple, one simple one if you're interested in that one continue the beats do go down deeper and up higher they do where the core center is not the core the center pipeline of them will begin to show different okay that's where some of my stories came from when i teach it's like a pipeline to an oil well and the oil gushes up uh that, presentation to the students probably came from having a real feeling for a pipeline and much more energy flowing up and down and hey, better presentation in this case we're talking about healing okay on that one let's see a second possibility ah oops okay uh we've uh, presented do i want to do that one for a second oh not third second core, work uh we we've had a session on core uh, let's quickly touch on it again uh so like everyone knows about cora these days right every, gymnasium every pilates person whoever core, and they're getting results because at first the first core let's call it is a physical plexus and when they get to activate that core it, lights up the whole body the whole body potentially gets stronger okay i think i had paul bowman uh, talk about when he was first introduced to, that core and he made amazing progress, uh, when he caught what core is his ways increase a tremendous amount so much it's like hard to believe you know core but because the core emanates through his body suddenly he's adding a hundred pounds on something and on and on it was a in a short period of time, years of training this is like fast, but paul is kind of special in some ways but anyway the core nation so even at that level people can pick it up physically to physical bits better is all i'm trying to say you continue easy, moving into a finer dimension easy open settle the inner finer moving into a finer dimension, okay the finer dimension has a core at that dimension it's your chords you okay but at that level the dimension that core begins to emanate more energy so i like to use i have used the tai chi master pattern kind of thing uh i think i presented uh the earlier level of core uh, which a little more energy involved uh tai chi uh where the arm movements get, freer okay these arm things just move better that should be natural from that first or that level of core emanates more freedom of upper body movement as they continue there's another uh inner finer core and suddenly they get the legs move, better they don't have to prepare the kick it's like boom, there's a kick it's just there okay and on and on and on finer and finer, see people get stuck along the way they could get stuck at oh boy my arms are moving better my punch is getting really i'm cool wow and they stay there forever in a lifetime okay, level of comfortableness they're happy, too bad because there is more and i had a feeling they could tap them more maybe they can't so i'll leave them alone they're happy with their fancier but they're better than the norm hey look at me i'm special okay, uh but i'm hoping you guys are more interested in the continuation or the more the more, finer more original self you okay if you're not eventually gonna drop away, and say thank you not though i can't take anymore i call that level of comfortableness okay core, easy, settle, [Applause], you start the game there is a core easy settle open i'm getting a faint image of a round ball here yeah and that don't get caught up geez did i make that up that, you're wasting time you're wasting time easy settle open core, core, okay, now it made not a dramatic move but it's a little bit bigger a little bit lower a little sense of a little heavier okay, so, i didn't have to worry about that i make that up because this one is much more obvious to me it's definitely lower but you can almost feel the extra heaviness of it okay, and if you can't be as fast as i am that's okay i've been practicing for a while okay but, soon that would show so don't waste your time diverting okay, we'll lose the potential of a trader trajectory through all of this eventually potentially a core, core now uh what is core uh core is a location open finer core shows there what is core, is where uh your energies gather, you each have your own energy mix i mean we call it color mix or we could call it quality mix let's keep it simple right now your energy makes the, types of energy qualities are comfortable for you that you've hooked into that you're related to and the better meaning finer inner dimensional core the better it can radiate out as a healing factor kind of like if you're more balanced with your inner self or as in herself, yeah it's better as in herself more balance, that balance exudes and we can begin to see it potentially in a healing, okay now again there are many levels many dimensional levels uh so i would think you'd get potentially some healing effect from even the first simple level that's what we used to get with i broke my arm and i'm going to stick my arm out there and, energy, and they'd get results they were not a very deep level this was a lot more kind of new at energy flow kind of thing uh but they got results okay [Applause] when we do when we do that arm bend thing somebody bends my arm, and i just settle and open more energy flowing through ah and it's harder for them to bend the arm, continue, i guess i guess potentially impossible for that person not impossible for everybody some monster will come around and bend your arm you know so i don't like the word unbendable arm somebody will say oh and bend it uh but as a check for if you're at that level that should be happening oh starting to break down oh okay you need a better level you settle and open into a finer energy dimension and, add a finer energy dimension boom stronger on okay so just a check for uh, are you in the right zone see if you're just having an idea about yes i know how energy, flows dip at your arm okay or you hang in there and you um and then throwing energy no you're not you're straining your ass off what are you talking, uh so it gives you a chance to check was that internalized manifesting naturally to the outer it's just a check okay it's just meant to be a check all right all right where am i going where am i going core, core so core find your core your energies your qualities it's like a, gathering spot there we go gathering spot, and those energies emanate okay now if we're going to play with healing i'm not sure i kind of if i play a bit with that [Music] i kind of say healing core in case there's a little variation of core when i throw that word healing core and i'm not sure yet okay, but definitely a gathering zone for your qualities, and the finer your inner sensing experiencing them the more they can radiate out through the finer energy body you through the heavier physical body you and maybe even a bit more okay um don't know if i covered it good enough, did i miss something in there is that is that thing okay yeah, yeah any comments there feel free this is justin i uh i'd like to add or to magnify something that you said when we're talking about self-healing um self-care also comes to mind things that we do that we need to do to attend to our own self-need like hygiene for example this kind of checking in and um settling and opening um can be should be done like the other things we maybe should do on a mandatory level for our own self-care um as an ordinary thing day-to-day yeah, that's why i'm throwing out these possibilities what do i want what would i like i'd like people to catch on to this inner dimensional finer boom what do i have to do to get you interested in this i'll teach the golfers to settle better do i give a about their golf game i don't think so but i would teach them because if they can get centered a bit and be a little more present they got a first piece of it maybe they'll continue and go hmm what is this centering stuff because i can really hit that ball better it's smoother it goes further wow maybe i've hooked them or their own systems had a chance to hook them and continue i'll come at it any which way i have to come at it to get it going okay uh so yeah aikido techniques and all that stuff oh yeah that's cute but that's the work the inner work okay i don't know say the real work and if you like that form as your approach pattern hey cool and then i'll mention healing form and some of you are a little bit we'll say yes healing how do i do that inner it's the same process basically just coming at it from a different angle okay, so i say to steve who's into ball baseball uh salahaduro he picked up something from sensei he went from went from well he was a pro but his batting was not too cool and he caught on to something he became the hitting champion not just of japan but uh his score is his batting thing uh it was like wow okay you know about him if he was american unfortunately japanese so and you probably don't think much about japanese baseball but they got some good boys on there if you notice the american teams hire them sometimes so you'll see japanese players and you'll see a few american players on a japanese team so uh i don't know if they're equal but anyway sadaharu was uh caught onto something and he was hitting different than a normal human being hits okay so anything that facilitates and gives you a reason to do this work this work to do this process uh to catch on to the potential wows of it uh i mean didn't oh sensei was trying to wow you about this by saying look at you can't defeat me and all the marshall obviously wow okay because they were interested in martial arts um and you would do little games you know, to catch your attention like to walk faster at the train station where we have to run to keep up with them uh an old man and we're young and we're running for god's sake this little game say check this out you know kind of thing, uh should catch your attention it's now it's up to you to figure out what's going on here uh okay but some people stop at wow sensei and that's it they don't do anything whatever so, the core approach easy, kind of like a ball of energy if you would finer and finer and it naturally emanates and in there's a healing capability okay um core i'm wondering if, we shouldn't if you're advanced, don't have the core just be a, ball in your belly but it's finer and finer that the core may be equal to your whole system uh, let's say you have a, you're a field okay you're a field that the core is that whole field it's not just a ball here, okay so that might facilitate i don't know if i said that well if you caught that, no big deal a ball radiating is good enough but i think it's more than a ball okay bob i'd actually say if you could say that again i think that was so important i don't know if that was it you said okay that it's more than a little ball it's a whole, field of energy is actually your core yeah and, and i'll do another overlay we've got a little bit overlay going on here balance of energy's qualities okay core, character, bobby robert nadeau that's what that meant there's a character here okay uh an inner finer uh it's not a body character per se but there is a, a oh god oh god an inner finer energy but finer body, kind of thing so it's possible that the core uh will show as a fullness, fullness sphere spa gre possibly just be open be open uh i wouldn't worry about that the first time just play core as core play the next one a little bit finer better oh you don't have to oh boy and it's as big as the body and that's core and you're going in oh yes it's core yes don't be so fast yes, yes but click, click, click, click later your clicks, get very fast later you can click clack but don't be a rush for speed don't mind a couple of click, clicks to establish basics so to speak and then just continue then now it can start to get smoother a bit faster okay, so uh so uh i wouldn't what i'm trying to say is i wouldn't skip the first couple of cores uh to go for that core that's uh, a big sphere here i wouldn't be so fast it'll, show i'm just saying by the way if this happens to show i think that's cool seems to be you tell me that's all i can say again on that whoa where does the time go uh, now uh any anything for a minute on, what whatever yes sensei, i have sean here i have a feeling that there's something about, um when you notice that things resonate when you have a sense that things click on another level and you don't need to identify it you need to go into it it's just a sense of resonation and, you just go with it and, it's non-verbal would you speak on that no uh but uh one by two by three bye yeah good, good, that one again yep that's good that's moving from uh one by two you're, entering a three by now at first it might feel like nothing's here it's empty you don't know easy three by three by now things begin to happen i get a vague sense of a center a vague sense of the parameters of it the circle of it if you would easy, three by three, by three there's some activity something moved there's some movement going on okay, and then that energy movement mixes up core character and there you are you're a three by three or experientially that's just something you know you're, experiencing yourself as a three by three remember the one by one guy was kind of crowded in uh the world this guy starts to hey welcome the world within reason give me some problems i can handle them within reason as a three by three uh so whatever you're talking about you should be able to use that as a reference okay is that all right excellent thank you sensei thank you all right, ah, healing, healing, healing, uh is diana florida on yes i'm here diana real quick in your couple's workshop did you do the energy hands partner um no yeah sometimes it wasn't it didn't it didn't become yes or no a version of it yes but what i was going to present real quick i don't want to get into detail here we're running out of time but uh in doing the a couple sitting uh making hand contact uh they begin as they settle easy to begin to catch there's energy or you might mention it to them to prep them for it but they begin to feel the energy, current through continue to settle and they may feel a continuation of that but more like they're beginning to in energy touch each other, than the hands okay and, eventually or soon or whatever you would you would notice their relationship is better with each other because they would say so they would talk about that oh i have more caring for her i had more understanding of her or something if you're doing a lot of that, should have shown anyway uh not to get into your business but uh and so i'd say oh we could call that couple's healing couldn't we and what did we do we settled got to a finer dimension just happened to be in the context of a partner relationship and we settled got into a finer dimension and things begin to naturally show and happen so the couple that was say bickering a lot suddenly here they're not interested in bickering if they really get a flavor really experience it they may not bicker at all later or very few times compared to what they used to do whatever, depends on them right ah but it's isn't that a type of healing couples feeling yeah absolutely okay thank you all right what's our third one here oh okay uh the uh mind body mind body big phrase in ikea i sort of don't like the words mind body uh because of the tendency of go my i, idea and that body and they think my idea and my body it's not quite the right flavor for it i'm for me okay but following that and following this simple one we've done more i've shown you we've done more than once i have an idea i would like to stand better whatever better means i'll, leave it open i'd like to stand better okay easy settling opening the energies are gathering i'm a little slow right now they're gathering not quite yet but they've got here comes here it comes boom, boom so that was the partnership between the idea presented and its partner the energy, okay uh so i was wondering about using that let me double check anything i missed here [Music] okay uh i don't know so let's say you're uh illness [Music] okay just basic i would like to be healthier, i would like to be healthier okay easy that idea is being presented to its partner, we need to be healthier and the energy's qualities are radiating and in my case right now they're mixing up a character i'm getting a clean looking he's even growing a bit uh young, guy i kind of recognize him from other meditation work he's what i call the golden boy he's related to the golden boy okay it's not just a visual picture out here this is an inner sense an inner sense okay if after playing here for some minutes or for a while you don't happen to say gee you look handsomer now i'd be surprised, i would have to double check my work okay so the idea to its partner, responds, uh you could add the other things maybe uh, they respond and creating a core to the energy's quality's core, character all of that emanating to take care of through the dimensions you're in finer to the heavier that was interested in healing because he was off he was off okay so uh some possibility of using the idea to the energy and the energy response, okay whatever form uh if you got the sense of it whatever form feels comfortable whether you use that as a core, or just a uh here comes the energies and they're pervading so whatever, they're pervading, the system and then again back at it hit them again and boom they're pervading so general pervading radiating or you throw the core in and use that as a reference radiation point or the character that's there let me see is that is that sort of okay sort of kind of maybe huh very much so yeah okay yeah i'm not sure i've been sort of involved in and out with this stuff for quite a while and i'm never sure what's clear out there sorry uh again not just the idea but some inner experiential sense okay now double check because you have an idea about inner experiential sense it's tricky that that's why i like those simple checks brad one second just a light finger like, little finger on top of my arm no it's a hand little finger that's not a little there we go i have to get better helper on there uh and just and just okay, not so heavy not for starters i'm not there yet i'm back in bobby land it's strange easy settle help okay bit better yes yeah yes yeah and it came from lower and i felt that i swear what i'm trying to say here uh it's not an idea an idea i can't quite get enough of the energy a little bit maybe but not really the energy that's better one the thing itself and to catch that yes have an idea but it's partner actually present whatever you want to call that experiencing itself experiencing creating the character you well since i tried to tell you when he said put it in your body put all this awareness stuff in your body where it gets activated as an actual something okay see again that's where he was different than just the awareness meditator types uh he picked up a piece we probably knew about at one time or forgot about or time to bring it in at this age and that was the harmony between the two forces okay, not just meditate but experience as you're meditating would be more proper experience okay, and that's why i like the little check so you can tell if you're experiencing okay, uh thank you guys and brad that's a little bigger uh where the hell are we oh mind-body relationship in relationship to healing okay uh what so for those of you uh talking to uh [Music] gina florida now gina you like the big darks in the big dark for me that infers an ability of going deeper of letting go of the heavier dimensions to get to a finer, level at which time things light up again at that finer level so i expect you in playing with healing for example to from that finer, whatever core character radiation of your qualities in a healing form i expect you to operate from a finer level, pretty quick because you like that down time so well that trading in that letting go uh you really like that tells me you can hit that, self level uh pretty good pretty easy uh, whatever, again i'm not sure if i'm saying things right tonight is danny on

good evening everyone uh we're just waiting for people to join sensei will be starting in just a few minutes, uh hope everybody's been well i've been away for a few weeks myself good to be back and uh everybody's been well as well lots more people coming in we'll be ready to go in just uh i think three more minutes uh you know it helps nado sensei when you turn on your cameras and he can see your faces in this television that he's looking at so i know some of you are shy but if you're feeling brave you can turn on your cameras and let sensei see your faces or any other part that you wish to show hello amy glad you got the notice this week, yes, thank you for sending it i got in two different emails so it was perfect okay which one do you prefer hotmail or gmail um gmail is the one i use the most okay but i had not received yeah, so i don't know what that was about but thanks for letting me know there you are yeah how are you guys how are you yeah we're okay yep uh you know semi-cocooned yes and uh you know uh [Music], coping numbers are going back up in the bay area not time to let our guard down that's true uh but i was in uh in the east coast for two weeks and a lot of people are acting like enough already i'm tired of it yeah i'm seeing that more here but not i mean still people are masking up inside shops and things so yeah, well let's keep, practicing uh safety and keep each other safe and hopefully we can keep practicing iq i actually don't mind because i can cover my face and then i don't have to wear makeup and it makes my life a lot easier people don't have to really see me it's just kind of nice okay i think sensei is just about ready to go and he will appear unmasked in his living room good evening sensei hello good evening thank you ah, okay, let me see let me see tonight is listed as slow down we're crossing a dimensional border ah okay before we get into that anything from last week carry over using balance if you're kind of scattered whatever use balance patterns and you'll get to an unscattered level of view, something like that last week what do you got to say about anything last week you practice with anything have any experiences you're free to talk well um it works like a charm um it's uh it's uh wow i, don't um just over and over again i've, felt myself you know get caught up in something, and then uh you know getting, back to the body, uh, finding the balance in the here and now and, what seemed perfectly logical a second ago, you know you know it just becomes clear like no that was some emotional tirade i was on and i should it's got nothing to do with reality yeah, we really, can get stuck in lesser levels of chaos craziness and it's really a reality i mean it's like superman, getting confused and clark kent is bitching because he can't find a parking place for his car like that, makes sense i don't know but not bad not bad not bad okay thank you anybody anything on that you're not going to talk to me tonight huh uh sensei bob here hey bob there kind of along the lines of what kenny was saying and things are chaotic or, whatever kind of long lines what kenny was saying if you if you're gonna fight the situation and try to make that situation, and try to make that situation right, all you do is get more and more entangled to it and then the reality of the craziness becomes more and more vivid but if you can take that moment just like he was saying and relax instead of fighting it, then it begins to dissipate pretty quickly, and especially if you practice a little bit it gets get better at it it's a skill you can actually improve on yeah let me jump in there because you said something nice uh something like um once you realize you're on a bit, crazy bouncing to not try to in that crazy bouncing get clarification these become tricks that you go oh that oh yeah that okay i won't bother trying to balance that bang, bang, bang craziness out i'll do something else that becomes a trick of the trade and you get uh you recognize it faster after a bit you get uh faster at getting to a balance whatever form you're going to use the balance uh better at it faster at it so it becomes a trick of the trade yeah okay so it enters the field of uh a count to 10 that kind of thing yeah i think your bob was at it that covered it, yeah yes ah okay, anybody anything, on anything okay let's look at tonight okay, i'll explain this great drawing here so, here i am in a certain level okay, uh, two by two is not too bad level as a starter uh robert maybe uh a fair day okay and we're going to do a little process right, so you can shift from that level that dimension, into a finer dimension that's here so we draw the line outer but it's not outer there, inner maybe a sense of larger but it's an inner larger okay so far so that shift from my fair day set my robert said okay my, two by two set and i'd like to get to a little better level function a bit better so whether we call it next will be a three by three or robert next will be a nado or a fair day next will be a good day so again whatever uh way you want to map that out for yourself those are just examples uh that i bumped into along the way, okay so far [Applause], now what i'd like to play with uh is the crossing through this uh [Music], dimensional wall the barrier that's not really there uh the membrane we used to call it a lot membrane, uh that, separates uh robert from nado or a two by two a three by or a fair day to a good day whatever that barrier is barriers much too heavy a word but whatever that membrane is okay all right and i'd like to go over that very slowly very slowly easy the eye and for you to get a little more familiar, with, the sense the sense of when you're going through a dimensional into the next dimension a sense okay now in the past we've used other words like a down time or dark uh what i'd like to do tonight is, have you as you easy take it slow easy the eye and as we play with passing through into the next dimension level of you again whatever you want to call that uh, that very slowly you get a sense of your style of the things that you bump into see some of you may not bump into dark, might be i don't get dark but you might get for example a pause might be like a pause and nothing pause often for me i get uh, a type of a type of i don't know easy, easy usually then i'm passing through into the next where after a while things are known okay are you following me so far if you have any questions up to this moment feel free nothing we okay very clear very obvious okay nothing then, should we do the standing let's start standing into it sitting of course change dimension sitting of course, uh but let's do standing okay, [Music] okay, let me see i'm just feeling the uh or experiencing me, now just now easy now i'm just checking myself out for now me start getting a sense of what my space is i'm establishing ah the center character me and the space just getting present my feet are on the ground here yeah okay now again we're going to call this first set, a, fair day fair day uh you're we're gonna call it a two by two, by two or again whatever forms you're using to uh, map your process now easy ease in the eye just a reminder what we do is not an idea it's not an upper half idea awareness, let's begin it as best as we can as a sensed experience okay that includes all of this stuff here since, since experience that we're going to get into an experience that we can feel sense to experience okay now how should we do this okay, so you're squared away at your first level whether it's a two by two or a robert, or a fair day okay, now okay now easy i'd like to move on to the next i'd like to be better do better whatever easy, easy, now right here right now we should be touching and beginnings the early beginning of passing through that membrane okay, but take it slow take it slow easy, as you touch that floor, membrane, the barrier that really isn't their barrier, easy what is your experience that could clue you in that you're passing through into another dimension, easy what's your experience at that border beginning to pass through the early stages, of passing through that border the new land the new dementia is not anywhere, clear yet take it slower, don't go oh yeah and i'm in this and i'm in that too fast too fast easy, slow down then i'm starting to squared away two by moving into hit a three bite but that early stage moving through what do i feel what do i experience for example i thought i felt a fair amount of feeling a faint sense of the lightness easy so what's your experience here you're following me brad are you throwing me out i'm better planted on the ground okay that's your first step yeah well my first said i was like yeah i, don't want you to move into the next level oh i'm deeper i'm a macho man oh slow people slowly i want to go recognize, to pass through the dimensional wall i want to hang with that, okay people you got that i want you to jump into the three by three up i'm really interested okay i think there's a hell of a variety of sensations of your sense of passing through, that you may not like my throat oh go dark and you might go what the hell is he talking about go time if you don't pick it up i start at first at first okay so how are you picking up this going from a two to a three but you're not in the three yet you're moving from the two the two is starting to move into but don't go deeply into that early slow it down slow it down i have a sense of deeper it's a deeper sense uh what i would call down time down time man so take the pause that's why you talk to me okay, so okay so thank you brad so i just want to know when you cross this green line into the next finer dimension uh, how you know you're beginning to cross that line and i may go thicker here because i want to remind you uh to have some depth so it's not just an idea up here that we include the floor and depth but how do you know when you're going through the green line bob i, was actually noticing a little different than, what you were saying it actually i hope so i want to hear the variety of possibilities that you guys experience so i hope it's different it, felt at first it felt a little thicker it was and, what it reminded me of it, it gave me the sense of get porous become more porous because this would be a place where if i was not conscious i would be pushed, and, i would and you know i'd probably get smaller rather than bigger or finer and, by being porous the uh it became easier to allow that new energy to start coming into the system, let's change the word there for a moment i like porous and it's kind of like uh oh i just had it kind of like uh, uh porous forest uh easy and open easy and allow, yeah anything porous, i like that um and maybe some people aren't porous so that you said the wall was thicker right, well it seemed like it was and that's that encouraged me to be porous rather than be pushed yeah so again keep it simple the walls seem thicker now people without the trick in the trade here, might feel like uh i can't go through that, i'm not allowed to go through that that's not for me that's for spiritual people or what the what whatever they'd say okay uh, but by recognizing this border which we're trying to do tonight and maybe picking up a trick in the trade like oh i, know i'm at the border because this little thicker feeling for you and you go porous easy the eye porous cool, okay yeah again i want to hear your styles of what you experience at the border and beginning to go through the border how you sense experience it okay so you recognize your own in case they repeat and repeat and repeat you recognize them real fast uh i can't remember one of mine as i begin to catch the pattern i think it was fear and after a bit i knew i was passing a dimension because there'd be a half second of this vague sense of fear and i knew what that was because i'd gone through it uh, before and, it would show up again and again as i dimensionally went there'd be that quick moment of this sense of fear but i recognized it as just a road sign road sign oh you're entering the next dimension how do i know i'm beginning to enter the next dimension get that's a touch quick touch of some sense of fear was it overpowering you know it's just a sense just a touch of fear so that was my road sign for quite a while, okay and it kept repeating and repeating no matter what level so you're following what i'm trying to lay out so far somebody help what you get going for you this is chip um chip, yes sir chip, i'm starting out kind of jumpy and i'm noticing i'm just kind of jumpy in the body and, okay wait this is what's happening at the border are you just jumping i'm just starting that's the starting place i, i don't know if i'd start jumpy i think we started if i follow you a little more present if you're nailing me around i don't think it's a starting place okay well that's where i was that's what no, you settle and you get to your first fair set you get to your two by two you get to your mr chip the first set then was from the jumpy all of a sudden i realized that i didn't know what was going to be shown or what was going to be given yes it's like i don't know what's there but i don't know to what is gonna be shown and what came up for me was just a calm the transition from that jumpy one okay calm one okay now don't go too far i want to major in that border i want to stretch that out we said slowly i want to stretch it out i don't want to be satisfied with just one word experience there and what else there kind of thing i want to stretch that we're talking about crossing the border the recognition of crossing the border so don't end up in the three by three uh with a split second cross the border but i'm in a three by three i'm not going there right now not now not yet later, in a few minutes but not now okay, are we okay so far chip okay, so you're crossing through the border again is from jumpy to calm and it's like a light kind of goes on it just there's a little there's a change that is a whole change okay like a, complete change it's not that i'm, totally there but that transition point is, clear, and it seems to just be permeable like it's been said i feel the permeableness of that okay and give me one word for that you may have said if i didn't catch it one, word for well besides the settling and the calmness, replacing the jumpy one i don't know what else to say about that okay uh well okay i just want to stretch things out okay, calm and what else what else i want to open it up more i just don't want to maybe some people are too fast with one thing when there's a couple of things going on is where i'm going here go home and also with the calm it was like a feeling that i kind of entered the room at that point okay where was it calm and a sense of presence in a train we haven't figured out yet easy no rush here right okay um, that was you uh who said uh i don't know yeah i don't know what's going to be quick story so i met eslin having my coffee in the dining area young couple come up and say excuse me sir uh they're not in my workshops i don't know who they are uh something about their relationship with each other uh did they say they may have had a sense of a past life connection and so they anyway they said this and the first thing that came to me was i don't i didn't say this but i was really thinking feeling it i don't know then i naturally move into another dimension and in that dimension i'm suddenly very aware of their past life relationship but that i don't know why they're asking me that stuff i don't know so that would be an example of right at the border i don't know and yeah easy and then the rest is click, click and then sometime in that new level dimension world whatever where things are kind of clear yeah thank you for that uh somebody we're highlighting this border path through i, have something sensei this is yes so you asked that we linger in this space we linger at that membrane and what i was feeling was a very delicious feeling of sinking and spreading and i didn't want to even move past it i was really thoroughly employing that nice there being there at that moment just sinking and letting myself spread yeah okay one thing you see it's cool to know we're just talking borders here and that somebody one of the lesser people, i could get caught oh this is nice this must be god or whatever and make a big to-do about it yes it's nice but there's this whole other dimension set up of them that they may not touch because they got they had a nice experience going through the barrier when you when you can sort of uh map it out when you have your own map you kind of know where you are and where to go is what i'm trying to bring out is that yeah so if there's in that middle space if you allow that and really experience that then it should, morph into that next level of view right so there's no rush to necessarily i see why you're saying there's no rush to get there because it'll just happen yeah, yeah and the settling and the whitening widening spreading spread the settling and spreading very cool that yeah can't go wrong with that settle, with the sense of spread yeah it was interesting because you i heard someone say deep or depth and i was like oh that's interesting because i'm not there yet like i'm on my way there but i'm not there at depth yet yeah that i'm there yeah uh so we threw out words like roots and stuff uh a lot of the intellectual types go oh yeah i understand roots i can think about it i got it but you're smart insane it's steeper and it's spreading cool but it's not roots yet not roots yeah you kind of feel after a while very clearly what level you're at you can sense feel ah yeah okay yes thank you that's cool uh people you're following what we're trying to do here just get a sense of recognizing the membrane between dimensions okay spending a little extra time not just being happy with one word if you have one word cool and what else there what else there just uh i don't know to say milk that passage through the membrane for all, it can give you all it can show all you can experience about it something like that florida i see you sensei, so um so um and i'm in a uh so my first my two by two is a as a centered is a grounded just here and now a presence but as i'm getting close to the border i feel like i'm my senses of being wound up a little bit little bit slightly agitated a little pressurized moving through there's a settling and an opening and my sensations uh body wise become more like a diffused um a softening a slight radiating a little bit but like a unwinding and a diffusing, with the settling opening and then the unwinding so you probably liked uh steve's word uh porridge huh taurus he said yeah he's close to what you're saying yeah it's one thing they use different words but very similar flavor yeah sorry go ahead the being wound up and then unwinding as i move through the border so to speak let me jump in for a second thank you a part of the map is uh as you're approaching this floor i will call that the main doorway for passing through the, membrane wall okay let's say that as you start to approach it the, more, energy, the more uh, jazzy uh nutrients that are next uh you start to be affected i think that's what you're trying to say uh as you were getting closer to that doorway let's call it the doorway that you're using that you start to ah yeah, and so that should be part of your map that, uh, if it's something big time uh, uh, that as you start to settle you might feel like whoa you're really getting pushed because it's big time that day whatever it may be it's big time and you can kind of feel that what would you call that getting raised up yeah, yeah i used to show that a lot in classes us remember, uh something like we would use a particular spot okay that's the magic spot we'll stand in that spot we'll settle down we'll open up and there's a lot of energies in the next level and you're going to feel them again if it's very strong you go oh wait i'm not quite ready i just felt a blast that lined up that he was talking about you felt a blast so whoa it's big time today i better open a little bit more here before i step into the hot spot oh that's a bit better i can sort of cope easy ah yes and i'm really getting a bigger opening here my centered line down shaft or pipeline or something so i used to bring that up that boom coming at you to recognize that as uh, kind of like the child's game you're getting warmer right you're getting warmer whoa, whoa so if that happens when you go to sit and settle you're not getting worse it's like whoa you're getting warmer whoosh, whoosh see that means ah it's cool a bit stronger than i expected that's all and i'm leaning forward i don't want to stay in the main shaft of it so to speak okay, open okay open really easy open because i know it's going to be strong and that that's what i'm doing when i step out of it or bow out of it or, or pause a while that's, all i'm doing for what you said okay so majoring in you recognizing your membrane with the sense that you probably get the same flavor each time or something akin to it so if you recognize your normal ways you'll get faster with it you'll recognize them things will be easier so what's going on at your membrane doorway yep i, sense a it's, dusty i'll say something if that's okay um what i experienced in that i've been working like the muscle fiber lately i've been feeling into that and like in particular the space between like the layers of the muscles but what i experienced was like at first the level two i guess was like being pulled back like a lot of back energy and like a web pulling back and then like the, doorway when we went back there was like a suction it's like i got like a pull like a into the next level which felt like space between those right here now what i want to do is stretch it out take it slow pull and i accept there's a pull and pull and what else is going on in the pull could we say easy yes there's a pull i can feel it pull and huh for me it looks a bit dark okay so for me i would say oh it pulls into a dark oh okay but you, yours pull and what else there be patient be open be calm pull, and, continue with the sensed experience of what's going on there's connections in there just doesn't mean anything to me say something clear to me i'm dumb you got to be like things that want to particles that want to match particles, that want to match particles that want to like come together okay i think it's moving into the realm already there's stuff moving around yeah okay again i'm just trying to hold it to that, that barrier wall that membrane wall and just really hang there okay so if you couldn't and you're into the next beginning early stages of the next realm fine but that's all i'm trying to do should you follow that yeah okay somebody thank you thank you and say it's you know yes, um, i also have that real thick feeling, okay not a wall though it's just like the remembering yeah really thick around me but it's also nothing going on which sometimes i tend to go am i doing this right you know it kind of bumps me out because i'm going what what's going to happen and yeah because there's so nothing it it's like oh your membrane doorway is a nothing it's not a nothing it's very thick but it really it kind of puts me into that be careful of the eye you know my mind gets clear and then i go what's happening am i am i doing this right there's nothing happening i have to really focus on staying clear and going through it okay uh so let's say the thickness told you you're at a membrane yes that okay yeah yes, then you continue easy you're hanging out in with the membrane yes okay, and probably they're too soon trying to figure it out yes that's the of things people you gotta stop doing that upper half figuring out not gonna do you any good, even if you figure it out it's gonna be no experience gina i'm not yelling at you i'm yelling at the world but i'm learning to go through i mean i'm recognizing it now i'm getting much better i don't get bumped out every time it's only taken me 40 years never come on you're cool come on uh so a thickness, uh give me your pattern again it's thickness and then very my mind gets very empty i mean it gets to where it's supposed to be i think you know easy behind no, don't say i think this is your experience now you can say to yourself i'll file that one away we'll double check it later but don't, slow it down with am i making that up am i don't, get carried away with that i'm working on it yeah buy it if it's not true the next day the next day the next day it'll clarify but if you go if you hem and haul along the way you're slowing it down so damn much, we're stopping ourselves we're hemming and hawing we're dragging our feet where i don't know yeah so okay thickness uh not, knowing uh, empty yes okay empty easy the eye anything more with the empty, and anything more if i hold that empty then i can go through easily empty hand i just want to see if there's anything more in the empty so to speak in the membrane empty membrane i mean it's empty but it's still very thick feeling of energy we already got the fake we got the empty now let's continue and member getting expansive and empty okay i guess i'm getting porous to go through, okay, okay, kind of kind of easy the eye clearing opening porous thing, uh all right so we tried to milk the doorway of doorway of keep forgetting that word membrane damn that word eludes me uh, and uh and, we couldn't get much more out of it so okay fine then you move on into the next realm okay i'm okay if you're okay, okay ah, so far so good people i, really like to hear, your, the things that you experience i really would like to hear what you experienced there and it's interesting we're getting so far quite a few words that are uh um chip what's your word for us no whose word was that chips whoever porous we're getting a lot that are relating to the word porous that's interesting you see [Music] i like to flavor myself ah, somebody let's go dante chris here from new zealand the um yes the um similar feeling is coming as you asked us to shift towards that edge, that um that membrane a thickening of experience and density um and then sort of moving closer and closer i guess right on the edge of the border, experiencing the density starting to sort of lighten so a light and expansive sort of opening as well but also at that point there was a connection with my scent and i think my, sort of regional pulling was through sort of to the center saying that was an assist it was going to be there for the next stage as well i thought that was quite interesting yeah a little soon wait till we get into this realm this uh this, next dimension circle yeah, yeah, don't bring those things up too fast i wonder that's why i said slowly tonight slowly people ah let's really let's get conversant with membrane, or whatever word that you like let's really get conversion so at any stage if it's ever there oh yeah that okay again mine was a, a, quick fear quick fear i think i started originally with the big fear what the hell's good am i am i going to die here because i don't know what's going on looks awful deep and dark to me and whatever, and then later just as i continued uh not just that day but for a long time after each time i crossed a border uh a membrane there it was for just a quick moment just a quick moment this, little vague fear but i recognize it oh yeah it's that means i'm crossing over okay told me where i was that i was moving along i experienced the that lightning is more of an excitement sort of a experience of what's that nextness so when it sort of when i went through that i've experienced the lightening of the density but also a lightening of actual opening, light sort of got me excited to that next what's that moving forward experience okay and again remember i'm not sure about this people but remember the next dimensions are more alive okay all right uh bobby can you can see me right bobby robert nadeau bing bang, hey but, it's more alive so each dimension potentially will show in a form that's more vibrant more alive, okay, so as you hover in close in there uh that you're with your word uh, excitement what was your word yes excitement yeah it's a lot uh, you have to go crazy with it's like oh that's because i'm entering this more alive realm okay and then we'll see after a bit what goes on here if, i don't run out of time i'd like to touch that a bit uh so far so good chris thank you thank you, somebody add that membrane separation from your level to the next level let's just really flavor a sense experience your style right at that little technical difficulty we okay yep we're back sensei we're back okay somebody i'm fascinated to hear what's your style of crossing over membrane come on people don't be shy for god sakes it's your style nice insight oh we got a couple of this guy the lion guard it's elaine first please and then mark okay um you know what i have to say is not that long either i what i notice often, is an ebbing in a way of like if you're in a state of two by two that, abs or there's a way it just doesn't hold anymore and that's, a clue for me to, to just to, just stay in this just stay just wait just listen, and, let me jump in a sec elaine sorry let me jump in are you saying that in your two by two world that you know something's coming up because the two by two world starts to get i don't know disrupted a bit not only that's it's yeah i mean that's, just sort of a metaphor but what i feel internally is um, i guess i guess these are times like either in the garden or with a client or just out up on a hill doing something in a process right that the initial state the state that you're initially in okay it feels like it just ebbs it it's the state becomes porous in a way it's, and sorry in a certain way you fade you were two by two or you elaine yeah the two by two or that just doesn't hold yeah and it just sort of instead of feeling agitated or i, there is a moment of fear, definitely or a little kind of uneasy what's going on really brief but like you say i kind of feel like i, recognize these things a little more often now that's not, unusual on people this sense of disappearing could i say you have to use my words now the sense of disappearing of course there'd be a fear am i i'm losing me i mean if i'm a robber then i start to disappear jesus christ you know uh they're gonna be a little fear, so there's that uh disappearance interesting one uh a touch of fear in there that's why i want you to hang out a bit longer so oh i'm disappearing and that's it disappearing and that's it disappearing and a little bit of fake sense of fear in there okay cool go ahead are we finishing up on this one yeah, but you know i, mean in, that area of the membrane and that transition um, that i just feel like i have to wait through the not knowing just wait yeah easy the eye, and things come in yeah, yeah, yeah uh, yeah so that seems to be the trick wait it out or easy the eye easy remember, i'm getting a little ahead when you're moving into the next realm next dimension, uh, uh unfortunately for too many people to be a tendency of trying to figure it out trying to understand it and it's like no, no easy, there just, be present with i don't know a sense of it will clarify easy just give it some time easy, easy and it'll show okay so i told you the story this uh aikido guy died and he visited me and said help i'm lost here and i say what come on how much time did you spend being centered that was a major in those days wherever you're at there is a center be easy and the center will show and then later the circle to the center will show and you'll realize who he is there hopefully character the plant at that level okay so easy, uh anyway that's the next piece i want to get into but let's continue with your experiences going through the membrane let's call it that your membrane doorway thank you elaine was that it yeah thank you i like that disappearing sense that's like jack should like that it's comic book material sorry jack somebody, i believe mark fitzwater is up next oh of course as i'm as, i'm about to kind of change levels it feels, uh at first it feels like a calling there's this stuff around the outside that's, kind of wanting to seep in and, um when i'm comfortable at that kind of that, two by two level it feels a you know a really nice place and if i do export you know the wall the membrane as you're saying it feels very thick but when, that calling comes, the membrane itself actually starts to change it starts for me it starts to vaporize, it just it just starts just, starts to, vaporize yeah it suddenly it's not it's not a that dark place at all it's things are coming through and initially when, i first sort of um when you introduced us into this dimensional work when that, calling used to drag me out um as and i'd get really excited and, lose it but, now i realized very similar to elaine, just, just settling and, feeling, that kind of seep in um, and, and just letting at the same time letting myself expand kind of expand into it as well let me jump in let me let me jump in okay uh could you say i, i thought i heard you say uh that there was this compression should we call it this inward thing no did i hear you wrong uh um, uh just, uh not so much well maybe, not i, don't feel compressed but i, fee i feel uh basically when i go through the levels i feel like i'm getting bigger so, again we're just talking about when it's time, to shift to shift yeah the dimensional border yeah, so at that dimensional border um it feels if it feels like there's a, calling of stuff that's, wanting to say are you saying are you saying calling c-a-l-l-i-n-g or yes at the first one calling, thank you thank you cooling, cooling, is that right it doesn't help doesn't help mark okay anyway um, yeah, there's, a bit of a, calling and when we and as i kind of kind of i have to really settle with that because otherwise it draws me out and i get nowhere i have to yeah, um and, and then the membrane itself actually starts to change it, goes from something that um initially i might not even know there was a membrane there but if it approaches thick and then it starts to evaporate it starts to i think other people can relate to that word they use a different word but that i think they can relate i think i've heard a couple other people mention words similar to that so yeah um let's go back to this calling possibility the self yourself says hey denmark here, so it's possible that's something you pick up as a calling possible uh where yourself is, pushing a bit for, mark to develop so that the self can develop, yeah possibly, anyway uh so you're okay with the border through the border whatever, that's all right okay so vaporize easy vaporize easy and then we'll enter this next realm uh but again let's not jump the gun yet i'll try to get to it tonight we'll see thank you is that it yeah, okay, ah, somebody yeah pat him on the back he needs all the help he can get i like to put him under pressure ah, one more one more one more no okay hopefully you've all experienced something now should we move along uh moving into this next dimension this next realm moving into the land of nabdo the, three by three said, the good day set we're okay with any of those words in whatever words you like you have the flavor for it right now uh let's say oh i think you can do it sitting okay easy, now to be a strong tendency as your present, easy the eye as you're more present easy the eye self as you're more present in that, not clear not clear place yet to try to move too fast and figure it out don't do that okay, that's like a human tendency or that awareness major tendency figure it out easy hang out being more present remember the, self lining up dropper keep the self more fully the, the self the self is present fully here easy the eye self easy [Applause], don't try to glow them on too fast don't try to look at it and study it be the smart guy in class don't, don't go there don't go there easy sense, sense feel sense feel okay potentially uh you'll a lot of different possibilities you'll sense c without heavily looking a bunch of stuff moving around a little a little bunch of energy's moving around let's call it easy you might feel more excitement or something because of that little things going on you see don't try to figure it out easy, yeah you see the eye okay, now what in some form should i say it this way should begin to happen i don't know if that's the right way of phrasing that is there is a center okay, [Applause], and, that center is in a circular set center circle, center sense feeling experiencing it's like i know you want to know but if you do that you, won't have a full experience and you'll continue, oh fire and firefighter not to have a full experience it'll screw you up eventually okay sense feeling sense experiencing okay, self is present in this domain this realm this three by three world or this uh good day world self is present so double check your what we call that line up positioning check your positioning as itself might as well throw that piece in so that the realm you're in and the sense of self there in that realm the energy movement centered a circle and circle the center centered a circle and circle the center we'll mix up a better character okay, so within that potted plant we moved into a finer potted plant and that potted plant the way it the two things move, mixes up a better plant a fuller healthier plant it's rubber's plant it's not bobby plant it's a good day everything's it's supporting a good day it's not a, bad day it's a bit better than a fair day okay, whatever again kind of map you want to use or words you want to use but you get the sense so what i missed what i missed what i missed somebody did i lead you astray here where are we so far we're allowed to chitchat so you've passed through the membrane this is the beginning of being in this next dimension and we're highlighting that part easy the eye don't be too fast to, make decisions let's say easy hang out easy, be present you're not going to talk to me sensei it's justin i uh, my sense is uh, that, my, my being is more comfortable i, have a sense of being more available, and more fully present available in my before we get into that did you did you have anything to say about the, room call it realm here this, this next dimensional place any, early sense of the place before we get in how i feel and whatever anything earlier than, that yes so yes so as i pass through the membrane and there's this uh an unwinding or diffusing sensation uh i begin to notice a, grounded a grounded i'm grounded i'm present there's a definite here-ness and a and now here now okay the center piece is showing yes so there's definitely a grounded um here, more present obviously around and i am present okay so the center's shaping there came first and then i was comfortable in that so i was available i was as i said and then i'm not scanning i don't want people looking around but then sensing the world, ah you're the guy that's more available and open to the world and therefore things can come to you yeah you can't get riches if you're not open to riches coming to you kind of thing yeah there should be a harmony between the, type of character and the size uh the size of the character in the world he's in kind of thank you so, far it sounds okay yeah and yeah you'd hang out there for a bit i can't go wrong pumping the pump up the center and feeling more and uh maybe stretch it out there a bit uh anything in that immediate moment that the that the centered character seems to be lacking in okay uh that it can notice that and put a call out to the circle you know i'm not as strong as i i'd like to be right here or something like that the circle responds that's the fertile soil nutrients which the plant pumps so to speak i like the pump and, is enhanced more yeah so you can play there for a while and, uh and, get what to say fully, i, people i used to lay out i think every one of you heard me say you're a visitor to this new dimension you're a, tourist or you get a green card okay just means you're more fully there in that same place and then you get citizenship you're really of that place if it's a green place you're mr green, place you're mr green whatever, okay that's what i used to try to get across by using visitor or tourist a green card citizen that's what i was trying to say yeah that you can hang out and get fuller there yeah and a good tool for getting fuller is the is the center character feeling himself if it's lacking hey circle response mixes up a better character better in the circle they both are benefited because they work and tan them uh and you can't go around pumping the pump for a while hanging out ah, and if it's a new level you might want to i don't know go for a walk at that level or try out a new batch of technique or try out your old techniques from that level just uh just to see what it's like or experience what it's like let the new kid in town exercise as long as it's the new kid in town exercising kind of thing ah that was almost well said i think maybe people would just like to end it there sensei, i could you trying to get rid of me no not at all i drew a lot of laughter in the house catches in the back room someplace giggle okay so again entering this new domain of course at first you won't know what the hell okay uh, and some people could make a mistake there oh i can't see anything that means there's nothing here for me i don't deserve to be here and they stop meditating or whatever process they're there they're doing like easy, easy, using the eye be present easy in the eye not clear and easy because it will clear clarify easy and i'm just using a basic where center should show or maybe a bunch of energy moving around shows uh maybe you feel more kind of thing fine [Music] yeah it should lay out as a nice package if you're easy there and hang out there it should just kind of happen okay, i, been tracking a friend who died just short time ago aikido guy kurita you don't know me was low-keyed uh but in uchida she uh from the old school he was uh he was uh eventually went to mexico and had a few dojos in that area and so i've been tracking them i always liked them uh we were buddies there for a while and uh we got to a nice dimensional level i think you'd call astroplane dimensional level pretty nice and, now i'm wondering and at first it was like wow kind of thing and a few days later he's more accustomed to it something i want to see what he's uh, if he's going to uh process their keep developing his self okay and what character he's going to take on so uh i sort of been prodding him a little bit uh saying hey you had a process you know when you were a nike dos he'd like uh keep one point kind of thing i believe uh is he's are you still using that as you're being, to continue to develop, okay, and then i'm asking him you know when you died you were a teacher, okay at this level are you not a teacher i'm not saying he has to be i'm just saying i'm just seeing if he's gonna develop his character, well in this finer dimension astral plane that he's on okay remember a lot of people don't catch character, astral planes unfortunately it's nice it's beautiful and they uh we call it uh what do we call it they take a vacation their hammock space they go oh this is great and they don't continue to develop it's almost like they don't they forgot the basics so they don't continue to develop there to eventually move on okay it's so nice and leave me alone i'm fine there so i think of it as a hammock in bermuda and you got a mai tai in your hand and you probably won a bit of the lottery, you got it made i think that's what a lot of them they got it made but they forget they're fuller of their process to continue developing anyway uh i don't know if that made any sense to you but to you but another time we'll talk about crossing over, ah somebody anything here before we finish up sensei i just i jump in again i, know we're working a very um we're being very intentional as we were working the process today um in this class um, in a day-to-day practice as we get close to these dimensional membranes there are sensations i refer to them for me as, feedback um, i found it useful and you've mentioned this kind of thing before to try to pick up on that at earlier don't wait until you're wound up try to pick up on the, little cues earlier that you're getting an approach going um case in point if i'm in a conversation with somebody that's getting a little heated i might start tapping my toe on the floor or something my body might become a little jittery or i'll massage my neck or some you know and very natural doing that so yeah oh wait this is the pressure i have to settle an open here but my body's reacting to some energies and if i'm unconscious to it and not fully present there i might miss those cues but then i catch on oh wait there's obviously some pressure yeah i think i think yeah i think the problem is a lot of people or most people are many people something aren't present enough to feel themselves so all these things are going on and they don't notice it and if something changes if they happen to trigger into something and something changes they don't notice that they trigger it into a different level and something changed uh they don't hardly notice it unless it's blatant really blatant you know uh so i said what the hell's with these people how thick must they be so i think being present and having some experience of feeling and finer eventually sense feeling and stuff, uh you can uh you can pick these uh what would you call that a science feedback but uh cues, coming in that it's that uh, might be time to move on here yeah, yeah, see some, cues are blatant the guy jumps out of the alley and he's a mean looking guy and he says hey i'm just kind of blatant that's a cue you better hate hope you better get into a better dimension there you're probably going to need whatever resources you have uh but again like he's saying we should uh be a little more sensitive to things because there's a lot of them going on uh, and will help us in daily life kind of thing yeah um, and i think the red at the moment anyway i think the first practice for that is feel yourself be more aware about awareness aware of yourself experience yourself whatever the right words are there so that these many signals that are coming to you are recognized and you can utilize them properly uh positively for your benefit for your benefit yeah okay, yeah something like that thank you thank you sensei okay what do you think people anybody have anything otherwise i'm ready to finish she's a short hair i won't need another haircut for a year and a half better than lauren now i don't tell him that, i got it all over him thank you everyone out of that thank you for hanging out thank you thank you [Laughter] one more quick look at your hair oh it's gorgeous all right good night everyone good night oh

## Developing The Center

**Date:** Unknown date  
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BIYdKBwWM4

okay good evening everyone hi noah hello mark i can see you welcome everyone we're just uh gathering uh, wasn't here last week i, know that uh it's quite interesting and uh terrain and character uh since they might uh want to talk about that again you might ask say again noah that was a good class oh good sorry to have missed it and um tonight uh his chosen theme is developing the center which uh has a strong relation to the potted plant, and the concept of nutrients and drawing from the soil so uh that should be interesting and uh and uh i don't i think we're gonna continue to gather here uh informally until, for another four or five minutes until sensei comes on so if anybody wants to chat about anything just go right ahead just us chickens for the folks that live in the bay area there's a bruce lee exhibit opening in chinatown uh toward the end of april that sounds like it might be interesting it's called we at roose lee we are bruce lee yeah that's the name of the exhibit that said through the chinatown historical society it's, located in chinatown i have the address but you can get it off the website, anyway it looks like it might be interesting we are bruce lee at least they didn't name it bruce lee r us hello people coming in welcome, welcome pat you're driving just wave you're muted there he's waving okay drive safely ken kron has just put into the chat the link for the bruce we are bruce lee exhibit, in oakland's downtown chinatown coming up, for bruce lee fans i have to say that when i was uh a white belt practicing at hombu dojo in the early 70s bruce lee's uh, uh, i guess was entered the dragon played in the shinjuku theaters and a lot of us went to see it from the dojo and it was inspiring in the moment and uh he had such a influence didn't he so, uh welcome everyone we're just gathering here sensor you'll be joining in just a minute or two anybody have anything they want to say when the eskin has moved to a different location i see i can do stuff like that too but i don't here's a little music to keep us going [Music] so [Laughter] [Music] wow [Music] [Laughter], [Music], [Laughter], [Music] and good evening everyone and welcome, wherever you are uh now doe sensei will be with us in just a moment uh tonight's theme is uh developing the center, and uh and uh sensei's uh we talked about it uh a few days ago he, has a sense that it's a very much related to the potted plant theory and the and the way the system draws nutrition from its experience, but uh you might like to start with uh talking about uh terrain and character from last week or uh maybe somebody wants to talk about what they're going through in their aikido practice these days or any other form of practice they happen to do i see sensei's ready so sense8, good evening there i am good evening yes, yes okay yes okay hello out there okay uh yeah let's uh start with last week, uh, we were doing the uh that line as the terrain line um, [Music] [Applause] okay let's, see where we're going oh what if we go back another week or so to uh sustain sustaining okay um if you just have an idea about yourself uh that can be dislodged you have an idea and somebody uh doubts you or the crowd yells you're a bum, uh, and, maybe there's so many of them saying that, you believe them so you, can't sustain too well at all which is the idea okay then, we settle down and we hit a different level, different dimensional level of floor different dimension we called it terrain okay, and, uh when you reach another dimensional terrain, uh okay where am i going uh, because there are energies of course in the terrain i think an example ross mentioned nice, okay and uh so you tend to think oh on the terrain nice i'm a nice person okay uh and that's better than that one that's the second level should we do that one uh terrain and you have some bit of a center body character you because there's some energy involved and you're starting to feel you have the ability of sustaining a bit a bit better okay so the idea alone will fade pretty fast, uh that level [Applause], standing at that level on that terrain or that floor that can sustain a bit better okay now better than that is uh who are you okay uh who are you do that bigger who are you okay and we'll take if you're standing on nice terrain it's acceptable to say okay you're nice but that's not as full as it can be nice, and, you start this pump going here and something else that you feel experience hopefully ah a couple of pumps and what else and what else what else uh i sometimes go i like fours uh i go for four qualities on that pump and next one and i feel it okay when you get this one, okay, when you get this one uh the ability to sustain is much, better you're feeling yourself as a nice person you're, more alive as a nice person uh where somebody says you're not nice might be water going off the duck's back it doesn't bother you as much because you're more you have more substance, you have more substance with that okay so i don't think you can sustain very well at all yes a bit better yes, but if you include a little bit more and that's where we're hitting this, uh getting the center better uh you can hold for quite a while and of course the way the things work eventually it'll fade but, if it's a common one for you and you've touched it uh it's easy to get back to you and get back to it later faster and faster okay, uh can i say anything accountable there i hope see where we're at hello out there sensei linda esken here hi linda hi, um thank you for reviewing that, i'm sorry, thank you for reviewing that, sort of snapped into a much clearer picture in my mind of what that meant it was pretty vague for me before that so sort of an aha there when you reviewed it that was vague well, yeah okay yeah okay it wasn't vague my brain was mushy [Laughter], yeah i'll join that club thank you okay, uh which aspect sparked you guys said a few things what would any particular little piece on their spark, you uh the, going clearly from having an idea being sorry of having an idea being easier to sort of dislodge yourself from that idea it's sort of a week position to, return to because it's just a thought but having a good solid embodied sense of who you are feeling it is easier to drop back into it when you want to yeah see when we do a simple exercise a bread can i burn you we're going to do this old time thing sensei if you could please step back one step, back to being thank you okay, i can have an idea have a beautiful picture go ahead okay and then again picture's getting better all right come on brad come on don't take it for me huh uh his second push was a little bit less than his first no, no, no okay, okay there now it held for a bit and it began to crack okay, okay all we're doing here really is giving you a direction that no it's not this okay, and it's not a stronger this go ahead and then you get no stronger this it's not stronger that you're going the wrong way, okay so when we do these simple checks and certainly that's all they're meant for is to give you a simple check for proper, direction we want no more feeling here that's pretty good it's gonna break i can feel it starting okay this direction let's call it feeling like, feeling, starting to break again ah deeper feeling deeper sense here we go yeah okay thank you so those are what those simple practices but then i have to say uh i don't know if you do those in your dojo, do you yeah or is she there she is yes are you muted yeah we do we do a lot of um embodied work feeling, into energies not specifically that but, that sort of thing yeah that's uh let's look at it just giving you a proper direction oh it's not more of this it's more of this it's not more of that it's more of this kind of thing and this is this and that is that and you get clear on know that this, more of this so that that's all those simple checks therefore, they're not meant to have a some great big massive equipment coming see if it can lift you maybe i'll send say i don't know but it's not meant for that it's just to give you a check and to have the ability of moving along a bit having a reference there so uh it's a reference aid yeah, okay, thank you thank you yeah thank you yes anything anybody hi sensei it's mark here from new zealand, i figured that um yeah we yeah we, do quite a lot of that um not that particular exercise but um creating some kind of problem and then just, simply centering and, getting to a good level where that problem slowly uh isn't a problem you're at a different level so your perspective and of everything is different yeah, yeah that used to annoy me at this level is what it's nothing so heading that way yeah, yeah if you're playing with some what whatever some kind of settling or centering, uh, and a person looks uh and you check them whichever, style you're, doing and you check them and pretty good and then you yell at them hey stupid and you check them still pretty good and then you grab them grab them with a little hey [Music] still pretty good it's, just uh so yeah you, give them sometimes different problems to see if they're able to stay with the experience, okay, it's not that they're ignoring you he doesn't exist he doesn't exist it's like at the level i'm at being settled or centered or whatever you're playing with uh then you notice oh it's different okay, yeah exactly yeah, so whatever games you can come up with anything anybody anything quiet tonight are you quiet okay, developing the center yeah okay, we're going to do very easy stacker it's very easy so back to the other camera one more step back we can see your toes uh, i don't think you seem like you can see one, toe that's all you get uh, okay, everyone yeah, first be present again there's an idea of being present what tells you talking about okay when i say present i'm inferring a feelings of feeling of being present so again your homework catch the difference between the idea of and the actual experience feeling actual, whatever words are comfortable for, you as long as they mean this here present i think okay let's see where do we want to go here, okay, we have resources uh that are available to me at this level, okay, or any level i'm starting with there are resources they're pretty close they're pretty close but for example i think generally we tend to be a bit lazy so in the morning instead of me standing here and opening to my own resources a little easier for me to drink a cup of coffee or two or three yeah i like coffee nothing against it right if you know me you know i'm pretty good with coffee uh but in certain way we're kind of lazy so if you'd like to settle present [Music], okay, you have resources there's nothing uh spiritual uh, give me some words uh out of sight uh nothing dramatic here you have access it's just ah settling and starting to activate hey, energies are just beginning now easy open easy open don't try to figure them out and think about them energies are just moving up and down through the system easy a sense of a sense of feeling if you have a choice between thinking about them and, feeling a sense feel that the feeling is too heavy a word sense feel them sense feel them sense anything in relation to them i notice my breathing depth is changing so these energies that are moving up and down, what else are they doing the potential for better breathing in a moment i'll be breathing better not quite yet but i can feel it starting to happen, it's going to be a fuller breath yes and, what else i will feel easy, feeling, starting to feel a little more fuller physical, feel a little more fuller physical easy, yeah, capability of thinking about it as the energies move they can push me into thinking basic right easy energies up and down no big deal they're very available this is right here, just a matter of us acknowledging and activating it there they are right there that structurally i feel a little fuller stronger that's what i'm feeling that's what i'm experiencing that's not too much for you all is it do you have an open mic quick, check we'll get back in a month quick check open my that degree of feeling is okay right you felt something you felt an improvement you're improved, i gave you my examples my breathing and then a little more body fullness and, more structural fullness hello out there so say this is lauren and i'll start off uh, you know we do this so often i have done it for so long that as soon as i start to assume the posture and begin it i immediately sense my feet better i immediately feel all my aches and pains the physicality that you talked about immediately get aware of aware of what needs to be you know released or whatever it is and my breath slows just as you and deepens just as you described isn't so the only thing i can add is that as we the process is familiar and as soon as my body starts it, it starts to draw energy from it and, transform a little bit but there is it naturally gets faster don't mind going very slow i don't want to go kind of slow tonight don't mind focus uh after a bit it's very fast okay not a fast idea it's very fast in the fuller of its experience, okay, so, let's say we do five levels, i'd say i'd say okay and take uh 10 minutes or something uh but after a while it's hey and i'm at that same place boom there i am boom i'm a martial monster don't mind the way i pick it up you could be hey for hate the most attractive fellow hello there ah whatever, whatever, clearly the, more we do it the, the more there is a lauren question were you pumping or aware of them up and down through this yes, you just didn't mention it that way just checking well for me the process almost always starts with uh now lately last few years with an up and down breath and that's what is my open and settled starting place somebody i'm feeling y'all wherever you'll, feel sheehan chris here from new zealand the um the um so when we've begun when i begun is the, body sort of i guess heavyish and then the awareness is you brought the awareness into the energy flow and the up and down the body sort of started to feel the synchronized particular it wanted to balance it wanted to connect which created that illness, yeah, one of my clues when i get too far out is i'm uncoordinated yeah, you know uh because one of the early ones is the one you're talking about we're starting to feel more coordinated your left hand knows what your right is doing, yeah, yeah, and i try to present it that way in the aikido uh certain things i do are one and two and three and four each one fully, and if they can do that then i know they're at that level because it's coordinated for example yeah that's one feet in the hands you sort of defeated where you need to be great, step back and they step back with part of their body and you go okay not that's a level but let's get to a better level and they step back and all of the body parts are stepping back in sync as a unit say yes at least that level for where we're at right here thank you yeah, and one more example somebody i'm feeling you want to make sure you're feeling, [Music] safe dave later um for me tonight hey uh for me with that exercise it was important to uh acknowledge the yin and the yang or you know whatever names you want to put on them and they both became very active all right david please lean towards your microphone we can't hear you oh sorry um for me it was important tonight to acknowledge the yin and the yang okay uh both things and that was activated, stop can you hear me stuck those are words what's the feeling now maybe i'm off but, oh ying and yang yeah what's the feeling in english what's your feeling i felt them come up my feet um and into my legs in my center and what were you feeling, i was feeling two energies of what two, energies two, one two, energies okay in what form were you feeling two energies up and down form or what yes it was up and down up my feet from my feet um left and right and then back down okay and back down okay, okay b, yeah just sometimes where i'm going is sometimes people may say words but it's words about and they're going to start to drift into the awareness about it so yeah but feeling i want the feeling i don't want to drift into words about i don't talk about after a while sometimes i want to be it right let the beingness express itself if it's able to you know yeah, not oh not oh i felt over there kind of thing sorry i can't say things well i'm trying to show it okay anyway thank you okay back to standing all right all right so we got to be able to cover that first part real fast present [Applause], settled some kind of opening here opening could be like an invitation easy just to start things going okay, this level deeper level okay at the level we're at the level we're at we're at it's opening to a little bit more so either have a sense of a little bigger, smoke stacked center or that you're able to ingest through your body more so whatever level we're at a bit more than before more feeling more, more up and down feeling, halfway, my feeling is my hips are starting to get stronger i can carry some weight i can start to mull on judo a lot of hip action in judo uh i, feel the fullness that i started with before but it feels fuller rounder and one more time a bit more up and down and check the feeling feel yourself oh feel yourself i'm definitely breathing i was aware the breathing was going to change on the first one this one it actually has changed and it's actually breathing fuller i am stronger a general sense of myself i feel more capable, of what i don't know i'm just a capable person [Applause] that's my feeling okay and we pumped a little bit more there if i can say should there should be hopefully there is an improvement on you feeling yourself give me some examples no i see you but i don't hear you, getting anything over there so i'd say my joints are much more lubricated and fluid [Applause] yeah uh remember it's a show in class i think uh not doing any uh being stiff okay normal stiffness and not doing quote warm-up exercises just playing a little bit with energy and after just playing a little bit with energy not even moving just playing with energy moving through and they would move better shoulder joints that hurt suddenly weren't hurting a sense of being more uh here it is it's here now uh, more lubricated uh just oh yeah i think a lot of people in warm-up exercises, force their tell their body to do a pattern, okay and they're forcing their body to do the pattern i, like letting the energies and body moves because of those energies a certain way yeah i know this, movement but i didn't make it up it just happened easy, easy, let the energies move the body here, my spine wants to twist a little bit now ah, look at that so instead of forcing or i need a word bob telling the body how to move along allow it energies allow the body to move yeah, uh i've seen people i've heard about people hurting themselves doing warm-up exercises that's pathetic isn't there something wrong with that doing warm-up exercises you hurt yourself, oh you must be forcing yourself to do something that your body's not ready to do but you have this idea i've got to do this warm-up practice and you're forcing something that's not appropriate come from the other way energy's in body with energies what do you want to do, now it wants to loosen up the um or the middle upper back [Applause] but the energy's in and then whatever the body wants to do ah i'm not at the stage where the body wants to move, the legs in the dance step kind of thing uh but i know it's coming close because i got a little preview that was coming up not yet but soon as i ah again open a bit more uh soon the fetal want to dance a bit that's part of the warm-up of the body uh we may have said something intelligent there bob i don't know did you want to add on to that if, possible, clarify that whatever well if you're starting your warm-ups for forcing instead of allowing chances are you're going to go into your practice doing the same thing that you're saying i got to do the technique exactly this way and whether it's appropriate for the uk or my body or what sensei is showing whatever i'm gonna do it this way and so that the forcing and the warm-ups forcing at the beginning tends to carry through uh bob just for reference the voice is blurring a little bit sorry i yes thank you somebody we had more there and he's more easily available we didn't do anything esoteric there one word i was looking for thank you brad esoteric spiritual weird uh these percentages that are here available for any person they're here but people are lazy and they don't acknowledge where's my pill where's my coffee where's my whatever uh, this is lauren again uh i said the second round started with up down breath up down energy but quickly, transformed itself into circle center opening you know radiating emanating outward and coming back and opening out what had been in the first round not only was i starting up down but i felt up down this time it just changed itself it had more energy and i don't know that's where it went so i'm mulling on what we should i mean that, center circle yes, yes, but we're highlighting center so i'm not sure i should say anything right here i might double count the center if you if you say oh it's going out and back double count the center okay because you're a circle type i want to make sure we're getting center ketchup thank you sensei okay yeah so i do understand that i got it yeah i tend to double up on my weak side if you would yes, yes yeah yes yeah if my biceps are out running my triceps then it's time for me to do twice as many tricep exercises as bicep exercises it's a basic training thing anyway something like that maybe, thank you and somebody say something more you weren't feeling more how were you feeling more you weren't feeling more well then let's not do this anymore it's dumb it's not working hello out there hey it's mark here uh yeah, i was i was i was noticing um i think it just seemed to be wanting to go lower, down and, a sense of stuff beginning to flow up and down so there's a deepening of it um yeah, my body feels freer and i feel like i can move i could move quite quickly now whereas before yeah, uh so we're getting more of this down yeah down yeah or in the potted plant we're settling there he is uh there's soil but with a sense of settling deeper finer soil settling, deeper finer soil settling deeper, more finer soil dimensionally it's changing so when, we do depth uh a sense a sense thank you thank you a sense of a sense of uh it's a finer dimension depth so, as you go deeper just that sense uh, if it's a noticeable deeper also that sense of this is a finer dimension so as we go deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper we're moving into finer dimensions okay uh if a and a gross a gross uptight guy okay does deeper and deeper and deeper as a gross uptight guy he won't get a dimensional change because he's gross so he's only going to pick up physical and physical and physical he'll be the same old give or take because it's not dimensional so depth and a sense of a finer dimension i was going to bring that up later anyway but you brought it up first so okay are we okay so far people is there anything not, clear as to what we're doing okay one more go around here hello, yeah, cool, hey yes um, training aikido nowadays has been really using, the exercise for me is doing the basic i would say the centering more than bouncing back uh on understanding for myself i work a lot of with the changes and conversions so when i'm encountering troubles nowadays instead of focusing the trouble i have been practicing a little bit more to stop to stop and focus on what i'm feeling or what is going on about that draw but not focusing on that going back here first and then and then being able to go inch back into it yeah okay, what he's working on is again a basic uh this circle in that case represents the situation when the situation changes okay, the center the center is affected and wants to change to be equal to that circumstance okay, so it so it sounds like a very good pattern he's using uh once he's aware all changing circumstances don't try to figure out the circumstances check yourself because there by law the energies that are forming up this new character center plant you, the character you the plant uh, is going to be equal to that situation okay yeah, a good basic and the way that he practices it sounds very, good that he immediately starts oh situation change boom, okay people often don't know when situation changes, uh that this centered thing is happening and if they don't know anything about this how the energies move and how at first it might like tingle through you or uh make you nervous or shake your knees where you think you're afraid or something uh where am i going they're screwing up this simple pattern this changes this has to change it's a law it's a beautiful law okay, you've got one person moving in on your uke, and you can you have a fair center for dealing with them and we say oh cool now we're going to have two people and they start to roam around you they're gonna come in on you at which time you have to quickly you can fast after a while hey, because the center character energies up and down is changing to be he who handles two attackers you're pretty good with that we'll throw three out but following that same pattern, we're seeing if you can keep track of the changing more incremental except right phrasing uh circumstances okay is that is that is that is that any good pattern that he's laid out um thank you be, you may have mentioned this before the uh, somebody attended a workshop of mine at esplan for a while uh, business uh big time uh and he said uh the, biggest problems the business guys were telling him were at that time uh interruptions were they didn't like interruptions okay, so let's keep it simple you're sitting there doing a math problem you've got to figure out i don't know the math problem suddenly somebody comes in and says boss the water pipes are leaking oh we got to deal with that okay then you come back to the math problem and you can't get back to the math problem what happened you had a center for math okay, situation change boss the water pipes are breaking in the bathroom whatever we're flooding boom has to change the character he who can handle a flooding toilet bathroom, okay, now you come back to the math problem all right and you haven't given your system a time or clear instructions i don't know if that's the right word to hey we're back to math and you open and here comes the math energies and then within ah some moments you get faster after a while okay i'm back here on my desk with the math problem and i'm ready to do math they don't know how to i, told him a waste time to save time wasting time you're just establishing in how things work so that you can work is that is that and okay did i say it right example, situation changes center has to change it's a law okay but people don't know how this works so sometimes situation changes and people say oh that's a bad situation we need a loss so that situation doesn't happen, what are they bitching about usually that this stuff begins to happen up and down their system and they don't know what it is they get crazy or, what they call fear uh no we must have a law so that doesn't happen anymore because i don't like this crazy feeling make a law that, doesn't happen we got too many laws that's me uh are you following this nonsense i'm talking about yeah okay, so, back to standing so one thing we're trying to do is get familiar with a very common a very natural happening okay and, and, happening they can be utilized so you can feel better function better all of that stuff okay so one main component is the center of it the plant the plant the character bobby robert nadeau okay me who through experiences ah okay now let's get back to where we were before take a moment ah see we were talking so you might have been thinking and filing things away and mulling on back to here, here [Music], ah, here, we go all those simple things up here and feel myself here, my feet feel are feeling the rubbed floor yes so i'm more here feeling the body actual not knowing i have a body feeling the body actually yeah, yes feeling the body actually okay now we'll want to go a bit deeper now let's just have this too simple there's a little layer of darkness between where we are and the next level dimensional floor the next terrain okay, so let's hang out with that piece of darker passing and then through the dark is this next level [Music] i think somebody's might be so big you're clear on clearing out your closet what are you doing over there i'm trying to bring up this the beginning of dark a lot of people are afraid of dark remember human condition is people don't like the underworld because they don't know how the energies work for one thing and in the underworld there might be a quietness a dark maybe empty and that scares them let's call it dark through the dark it's just us inch or two it's okay through the dark and hey we're at this next floor finer energies are moving up and down easy it's probably going to be more so i check my openness my, pipe would i call it before a smokestack make sure the smoke stack is open a bit easy at finder their finer energies and a sense of more okay now remember more can spin me into thinking, uh so i'll notice if i start to huh, see simple trick of the trade easy the energies don't want to push you out but if you're in the way they will okay finer energies up and down now i'm with matt my depth of course feels a bit deeper i'd like to hang out here center deep deeper okay through the dark next floor finer dimensions energies up, and down double checking my open so the energies can flow better through my body my body take it personal don't do it around the body, i better take it through the body around the body might be a subconscious trick that i don't want to feel i'll let the energy go up and down and i'll, be aware of them but i don't want to feel them those energies are nutrients that's one reason i change words oh some people may not like to sense it allowing energies to flow through it's nutrients up and down affecting the body from deeper finer energies huh finer energies down by the way my depth height has improved from when we started it's definitely deeper and it's going higher for me i may be jump i may be ahead of you i don't know uh but it's uh it's finer energies my her, favor flavor i don't feel that with these energies mixing up through i have a more delicate touch i'm close to the point where i could do a good touching massage i'd be sensitive and be sensitive that's me with mine here and yours one more finer energies flowing up and down through this plant this character through the center experiencing [Music] yeah i like this uh this level by the way just for fun and very sensitive i think you seen me do an aikido where uh you're behind me a bit but i say oh his left knee is bending a bit i'm sensitive to it and feel it here i can feel all of that it's around this level so again for me it was not a traumatic but a very noticeable change of energies that went from two that were more obviously physically oriented the third one was much more that softer sensitive i still got a body and all of that but, but what i feel like doing what i would be capable of doing would, be different, okay, at that level i'm not sure if i'd want to do basic weight lifting but, touching feeling material okay being with a lady friend better that level in her hair that was mine what's yours uh sensei bob here because of the training you've provided us over the years about the dark passing through that little dark layer that you described actually made me better at absorbing and allowing the nutrients at that next level than i would have been otherwise, yeah let's add to that number blank at the moment, [Applause], yeah the fuller of the next could we say it that way because of using that the fuller of the next uh if you stay awake kind of like that whether with the heavy gross guy uh he doesn't get the width meaning finer vibrational uh it would tend to be just a very tiny increments if any but going through the directory automatically move to a fuller better positioning and makes those energies easier to flow through, fuller all that stuff so yeah, yeah something like that okay i, also want you people to get used to this sense of dark i don't want you if some of you like it like uh hawaii loves it uh but others aren't sure what to do with the dark, uh but get used to it because it's a it's a big thing in the in the creation there's a lot of big dark and then the next big light kind of thing but a lot of people are afraid of it we'll go into that discussion another time because i want to do kind of i'll go over a little bit about the passing over to the other side which is coming up for a lot of us not all of us some of you are young and healthy but there's a few of us who are, fading, and that'll be a major trick to know about so i'd like to go over that another night so that you pass over and take advantage of things so you can move to a much better level is what i'm going to cover i think anyway back to what we just did uh, anything on the dark or anything on the finer energies mixing up was yours oh it's kenneth yes go kenny um i think uh the, the dark um that's a down time right and, yeah and so uh it really hit me in this as, we were talking about finer, and that dark time uh that dark space i think for me i tended to go uh sort of screaming through the dark uh but i don't worry about my ideas but i but i don't worry about my ideas but i only set it up for two inches so and a sense of and no rush here we're gonna do very simple here uh but to catch it catch it rex to it yeah could mean something go ahead, well and, i think if i if, it's a down time then it's a time to let go right, feel, the space feel the transition feel the moment and then okay hold it there a moment if we did a different description we said bobby said bobby suddenly down opening so there can be a robert mix there you have to let go of bobby you can't have a bobby and a robber or my famous phrase listen do you follow that one is that clear to you uh yeah i'm not so established how can the new you be there so there has to be a letting go but in letting go there's a lot of fear by a lot of people oh it's empty i don't know who i am i don't panic it's gonna reform it's okay just give it a little time it's all going on it's gonna form it's there, okay, if you notice when we did the one by two by three uh two to three or any numbered any number um uh but two to three for example when you, uh, let go of two [Applause], three didn't show itself in a split second took a little time for okay let's see there's a center here easy oh i'm starting to feel some energies or something moving around oh okay and, and now i'm beginning to feel myself and you're beginning to feel yourself as a two-pie tour but there was a, a, gap a noticeable nothing a pause okay all right that you'll now notice more clearly so yeah where are we in interesting side subjects coming up though so good somebody feeling i have heard too much about feeling i told you mine i was sensitive and, maybe i could touch somebody be affair and give a fair massage here or be sensitive to any ailments in their bodies what's yours sensei this is tj all right all right um my example is uh has to do with performance musical performance and uh it's that time in certain situations where before performance you might get what performers call butterflies uh you know that, rising up of the energy from underneath that, uh initially a lot of performers will try to block how can i not have this feeling how can i because i can't deal you know i won't be able to play if i if i if i have all if i've had all this anxiety which is the interpretation of butterflies right, right, yeah so yeah so, that's an example of feeling and then so, like you worked with me on uh one performance i think it was in the 80s i was playing uh the great american music hall in, uh san francisco it was a big deal it was a album release party and so on, and it was like yeah and, you encouraged me to drop down and, and to breathe and to really soak in soak in what i was you know in, our in our language now is like taking in the nutrients, of that of that force that was rising up and re-interpreting it reinterpreting yes we got to interpret this stuff right and so misunderstood so misinterpreted ah, yeah, if you think of it as anxiety or fear that's what it is it's kind of magical in a certain way but reinterpreting it as energy yeah so nutrients and then the interesting thing is learning to actually practice with that before, the concert or before the event so you practice with that inviting or being present for the energy of that um potential event or that situation yeah good hold it there for a second yeah you don't have to be at the event, to practice you can just imagine yeah imagine you're at the event and the imagination starts things going and then it starts, things going and then it starts to activate it activates it definitely yeah and so uh it's interesting the, different levels of the situation because it's different, to, play at the coffee shop than it is to play at carnegie hall so, you know so that you have a different level different uh you have different nutrients you have you have different nutrients you have different things that are arising so you can so you can practice at those higher finer levels and, and, get the uh get the energy so like for a musician your hands don't freeze up your mind doesn't freeze up and you can you can move into what your mission is there which is to express the beauty of the of the music and so on so it, is a it's a highly valuable practice that you've offered us uh tonight and over the years as noah was saying, um, yeah i was gonna say and i've always thought i've or often presented aikido to the students as uh they were opening up channels by allowing energies to flow through, now again nutrients are the word we're using now but allowing those to flow through because sure as if there's ah situation where in san francisco an earthquake uh you're gonna get one hell of a lot of energies because the circumstances are carnegie hall circumstances you know yeah so there's gonna be a hell of a lot of activity uh and even if you sort of know it's nourishment if you haven't practiced opening up the channels what i call tonight i love that i think i love that term and that uh that example opening up the channels because us a system in harmony is a system that's circulating through the hole through its whole system i was using the word smokestack tonight that that's having a better clearer smoke stack so they can flow through that's what they want to do yeah but the identities are plugs bobby has a plug robert has a plug now double has a bit of a still plug not as bad as bobby's but a bit of a plug we've got to figure plugs are going to continue, maybe in lesser form but still it's plugs, we call it stagnant chi in qigong it's stagnation, yeah, ah good thank you yeah thank you sensei hi it's um nikki from new zealand when we were doing uh that exercise just before um it was the pot plant that came to, my mind and it was really um quite interesting because i started off with a tap root which was quite strong and then when i got to that first layer it started sending out side like feathery roots to i guess slurp up nutrients but then when, when i was when i was when it felt like it was really for the next level what i thought was really interesting it wasn't the feathery roots that actually, delved deeper it went back to the tap root that went down into the next level and here is what uh what's the, main the main central route yeah okay yeah, let's get our depth first and then we'll open up more hair it's probably what it's doing saying that right okay thank you cool thank you the oil rig has to drill down before to the oil i got my eye on you uh to the oil and then it, can take all this oil and send it back up but it first has to go down, to that depth and then it will gather oil however does it and send the oil up the pipeline so anyways going back to main stem first and then whatever's next will happen there so yeah thank you okay ah, um i'm not hearing enough about the body feeling uh feeling uh i don't necessarily expect you to i try to slow it down uh but uh for you to be at my level but weren't you at a better level of body feeling i, didn't haven't heard much sensei linda esken hey linda um, what i was feeling uh was a uh was a like a sense of airiness almost like the very diffuse expanding openness, that you'd like to be a ballet dancer leaping through the air oh maybe or a better listener maybe like a it was a receptive yeah receptive yeah mm-hmm like very light, uh be at that level in opposite of dense yes, and at that level in aikido uh that's where what do i get at that level that sense of it uh i can feel when they're starting to twitch before they make their move when they're getting that little warm up that you really can't see i can start to pick that up oh he's going to move next because there's a pre of their movement hard to visually see you may not see it but because you're there and you're opening more receptive and it's a finer level so you're picking, them up finer if you suddenly go oh there's three of them i got to keep my eye on all of them then they're gonna barrel your butt over right uh so anyway just in an aikido sense uh and i feel like i could blend in uh in a lighter more, effortless way hopefully so like there wouldn't be any clunkiness there yeah if you see too much bumping in a group attack you know then potentially they're not going to pass the test they're, bumping too much there should be some yeah so it just means they're not at that level that they should be to get that rank because it's at the clunky level if they're developing they should be at this level this level you see say how's their techniques well no i just look at their inner development if they're at a certain level, the techniques will be there at that level okay but i gotta say this inner i'm aware of their outer but the inner the inner the inner all right anyway uh eating up time folks so say something um should we do a quickie what do you think yeah quickly, standing, okay uh quick moment to get back to where we were present feeling experience here alone okay, ah, okay, okay, we're at a level whatever level you're at okay easy and again i wanna play a little touch with this start easy i want to move into the next floor the next dimension the next uh terrain level i'm just prepping you, might pass through a dark it's okay easy, and, after the dark boom you're at that next floor and it's light, here are the energies here are the energies here are the nutrients on that level turing and nutrients ah [Music] for me these are like lighter and i have to be a little careful because they're like i could be light-headed kind of thing but these they're lighter but make sure they're lighter energies going through the body lighter energies finer energies talking to myself through the body affecting changing the body, you're not bobby anymore you're not you're not bobby anymore you're not rigid anymore tell me about you what, i don't know what's natural for you to do uh i myself am not ready to go dancing and move my feet strongly but there's a lot of looseness up here ah might probably have a pretty good tennis swing, wow, yeah, back needs a little extra attention but yeah, the tennis shoe that ah that would be there ah that's throwing the ball especially for some region of football so i'm more limber [Applause], i'm not a bad mover if i were a boxer starting to loosen up there a bit this is opening up a video that's me what's yours what you're feeling what can you do i use body as a reference and says chip um i feel center moving first i don't i don't feel as if i'm doing it i'm feeling like i'm being moved even if i'm moving backwards i feel center moving first and then body is moving yeah, uh see and, aikido i can see when people have the idea to step back because they step back funny but the one you're talking about is i think would be much more appropriate it'd be center and the body moves back smoother there's still front but it feels like center centers moving in both directions really, first, yeah and if we were doing a walk under pressure game this is where i might shift to it's like a sail but the wind is doing the work i'm just a sail i let the wind do the work so i'm being moved but i'm not moving myself a certain way i'm being moved yeah, so we've done that thank you thank you somebody body, find finer energies mix of a better body a healthier plant ah and as hey mark again, yes yeah, yeah, um i, get a real sense of just being far more capable and in my senses uh um for instance my, eyesight suddenly everything just seems sharp around i love that when that happens yeah, uh yeah i feel like i can just no big deal but it's a happening you kind of know you, hit another level because the you're in the same room, and but it's like they turned on some extra lights yes yeah, yeah, people in the room are suddenly sharper you can see them sharper or something yeah, so it's kind of a cute one when it happens just, let you know yes you see it's working, things are happening yeah that it thank you people we people we have eaten our time and a vitality coming up through the center of italy and then radiate radiating out into the body so really coming alive you know really starting to get going yeah in aikido it's uh radiating it's, boom, yeah, it's not i do that it's, it's, just happening more now inner finer outer happens is that it are we finished that's how it seems to be in new zealand that's um that's supporting you tonight sensei it's mike i was um yes and i'm afraid there's no video but um, just because my internet's that poor i would i would love to put it on but you wouldn't be able to hear me speak anyway um through those three sets of exercises you did today in the first set the, thing that i noticed most as i as i started following the process was this sense of, all of my body being connected and then in the second one i noticed i noticed that, sense was, fuller quite a lot fuller actually and it was extending right into the you know the, soles of my feet and, the and the tips of my fingers but a better level of it okay yes, it was it was stronger like the first time i could feel the connectedness but it was uh it wasn't just yes it wasn't as clear the second one it was a lot clearer in the third one it was progressing in the same way until all of a sudden i thought i was about to fall over because i felt an amazingly strong push in my back and uh but fortunately i didn't react to that and realized that in fact it was just the back and yeah it just that was my experience in going through those exercises and i got it so yeah so yeah was that the circle being or was that something here being but in whatever case we have to notice that at least open yes more open back minimum we got to do something like that but if it wasn't for your teaching in that area of when things like that come to, to nudge you um, my inclination would have been to, believe that it wasn't that i was going to fall over and that i needed to do something about my balance there's some spirits in your house pushing you around yes indeed, indeed, and the other thing i just wanted to add is that what i notice now quite um well very, clearly is that the very first um conscious breath i take immediately uh, changes whatever i'm doing it gets better with, better breathing and more settling but even that first breath when i turn my attention to breathing okay um and yeah it just has an amazing effect okay good no and you and you it's it all it's all, the pieces fit together but they should if they don't something's wrong [Laughter] yeah anyway thank you very much thank you, i think people will our time we are just four before eight california time sensei and thank you so much for a really wonderful evening and uh and people these are here to be practiced okay it's not just the whatever, oh now i know yeah did that and there's the actual well since i tried to tell you even close to his deathbed uh he says i gotta continue to practice he wasn't talking about doing techniques because he was practicing this inner work continue to practice okay after he passed on the word was he was still practicing keep it up okay thank you take care thank you sensei, thank you everyone hey thank you thank, you everyone hey thank you thank you thank you lauren thank you lauren thank you kenneth good night everyone take care

plant electropotate plant will go deeper into that sometime anything from last week on these finer inner dimensions experienced thank you brad yeah hello out there in the world you people better talk tonight uh because i'm not much for it tonight from new zealand yes, um, i'm well thank you um, it was interesting i was watching a an older video of you and it was a session on being present and the more that you were being present the, what i could see on the video was that the more you were able to connect with okay, and, but you weren't talking about connection with okay um you're just doing a simple technique where you were present okay was coming in and then you were just basically connecting and gently putting them to, the mat and i said i, said to mark i don't get this because sensei is just talking about being present but what i can see is that he's actually being, connected to okay so is that two different languages because to me that means you know and, they might be saying no, sensei is just reiterating what he's been saying all this time that, and i said and i said what like what like you, you don't actually practice connecting to okay you just practice being present and then that connection will happen and there's going yeah and yeah and, that to me was a real revelation because then i said oh my gosh so that means that when you go into a finer dimension and you um, you practice getting to a better level of you then it means that these things like um feeling the energy being more present getting that connection with okay then those things actually, happen, um more easily and, and i think oh, my god i've just been practicing it backwards because i've been all this time i've been trying to like build my connections with okay and feeling the energy and the flow and all this but actually if you just if i just practice being more settled being more grounded doing those, processes of getting to a better level of me then, these things that i've been trying to practice will actually happen more easily and, and guess what no, anne no air no end but on wednesday um i practiced this so we were doing um okay, was had a ten toe to my back and they were, pressing forward or giving some pressure forward, and, to start with i was being really distracted by the fact that there was this pressure coming on my back and all i could focus on was that there was a tanto going into my back and back and, that was being really distracting i couldn't get past that but then about you know halfway through the class because it took me that long to, settle into it, was okay just um ground, ground, ground where's my base build that base a little bit bigger do some more grounding and, it was it was i, at the end of, that particular round i said to my okay were you actually still pressing the tanto with the same amount of force as previous times because that time i didn't actually feel, that tanto going into my back it was it was like you were being really light and he said yeah no i was still using the same amount of force and, that, was just yeah that was a real light bulb moment sensei, could we could we that's basically a center circle one way to look at it the better the center the clearer, uh the circle so whether your, circle is connection or relationships it's like yes if this is better that's better as you uh allow more of the circle center gets better as center gets better circle gets better in relation so center circle basically but it was it was just really exciting [Laughter] okay yeah basically center circle in, that case you settle more and your sense of things how things work around you uh the world you're in the circle uh should get better basic okay, center to circle okay in the potted plant theory if the, plant itself the center uh the plant itself uh comes more alive it's alive with the nutrients of the plant it's in and the finer soil the nutrients in the soil and those activate more so you just plant to that soil, back to the plant, grows finer soil comes into play you begin to increase your pot size that's how we laid out uh so potted plant theory is in there also um yeah so okay, somebody anything last week uh sensei this is bob hey bob one thing you emphasize with all the patterns was you need to experientially absorb the energies the nutrients that are present before anything else can really happen [Music], yeah you know all the uh i should take this one down again uh yes, [Applause] 1 by 2i uh one by one by because we start going has lesser available resources as we shift into a two by they're just there so it's a matter of settling easy and we're in a finer dimension and they're just there it's a law okay, they're all there but we're so ah we're not aware of it easy, easy settling opening whatever clearing, so you can move into the next dimension level ah okay and because of the more aliveness in the potted plant we call it nutrients maybe the more aliveness and harmony whatever of the energies in that larger space of two by okay and he straightens up more he's better in his body he functions a little bit better, he moves along to a three by and it's more of the same so uh so yeah uh we use different words catch your attention uh so potted plant the nutrients the minerals whatever uh in the two by uh the finer energies are there and they're more harmonious whatever they're doing in their harmonious beats different qualities are available there and they all enhance so the three by three person ah, he's straighter he's stronger he's more effective he's more aware of his surroundings he's in relationship with them so yeah all the patterns are very similar, i think we tried to get that across last week that we used four different uh forms four different images patterns, four to four different patterns but basically i'm just laying out the same thing there's only one universe okay now how we look at it and work our way through it but because it's, it's one thing uh we present it in different words and different stories and stuff like that but it's still the one thing there's certain rules and regulations of how it works okay so whether we're one buying or a bobby roberting or two uh one by two by uh or bad day fair day good day uh following the same patterns that's all we're trying to get across so in whatever way it's comfortable for, you anything here are we finished with last week give them a minute maybe there's something left out there what do you think people any other questions last week i don't know but i'll say something go ahead go ahead soon okay, in practice oh i'm looking better uh in practicing uh the practices oftentimes, we want to practice them in situations that are we'll call them non-optimal or challenging situations and it's my experience has been it's just something i want to share with you and the other students is that the first hit of a problematic situation is not often the most, hasty, if we have a unpleasant situation we're opening to that the very first inclination is i don't want to open to this anymore taken years of training to say hang in there open up keep going and i still find it a challenge at times so i didn't know if you had any comments for that, uh, or if any other students had experiences as such uh, let me let me get clear [Music], [Applause], so the situation is happening something's happening yeah and what you say there's a certain point where you don't feel like continuing to meet the more of that is that what would you say that came true sure let's, say i'm having a disagreement with my wife you asked for it oh no but that's a perfect situation to open up more and yet saying i want to open up to a disagreement with my wife is not exactly the statement people want to step into but, it don't take that effort to yeah different things let's say i get locked into i don't want to listen to her bobby, okay, uh for me to get out of that shell of bobby okay a one by one kind of thing to move into another needs a little activity volition desire okay, all i can hope is that as we do this and open up that the energies that are showing and the mix that's going on the better plant uh will be wow that's fun and, someplace it won't be a chore i don't think el sensei took his took his greatness of opening as a chore okay there's a lot of fun and excitement in, in there so, back to you again what, what, what [Applause] i don't know knowing we get stuck at a certain level and, to break through that little shell that membrane of that thing you're in, uh, and, oh it's more room here can breathe better i can hear her better i begin to feel what she's saying that's where we get but yes at first we might be in a tight shell and you don't want to move along any anymore we're inherently lazy could i say you know i might have friends to robert but oh you want me to go on and not do leave me alone i've had enough i'm tired here so bob man thank you for the reminder of the membrane and shell analogy that works very well for those it's a good uh analogy for those situations thank you yeah, bob may just the um oh sensei comment that the essence of aikido is the cultivation of the spirit of reconciliation and so soon i think you really hit it on if there's ever a place where we need it it's you know chair like charity begins at home i just think, what you're touching there is exactly the pivot point where we decide that we're going to make this process happen that bob's describing there's something very critical about what you're asking i, i think of it i, haven't formulated this but did pop into my mind on my front porch uh do you know what skip roping is not, personal skip roping but we're two yeah two young these are doing that you in my neighborhood that was popular okay, we've seen movies of it though oh man and, to get into the move to be the jumper uh jumper uh huh you gotta take a moment and, then you jump in and you, you move with that, where the hell am i going how'd i get into this uh there is a volition or something to jump into it there's a lot of things that go on that are, probably the proper things you have to settle a bit whatever the little girls are doing out there you have to settle a bit and jump in and start to move with the movements, so there's a lot there and i'm sorry i can't say that better i just thought about that skip rope and i was going to do the double skip rope we got two going on, uh the girls in my neighborhood got pretty good at that stuff yeah i think that membrane and shell are a very good analogy because sometimes the very first thing you run into is this the shell and it takes that moment of willing to jump into the skip roping or bump your head against the shell and continue to open and allow it sometimes takes that extra instead of just deal with the situation you got as best you can it's there you know just often i want to say leave me alone because, to listen to you i have to settle and open up okay [Music], leave me alone i'm in my shell i, i don't want to have to, activate, okay, so i don't know you have to find some reason to activate well your wife's going to leave you if you don't so whatever there's just good there's good reason there's this that first bumping your head against the shell and saying forget this and just that willingness to yeah i think after a bit believe it as much, or, maybe a name for it you know that's, weird now though or weird bobby or something i, don't believe it as much as i originally did you know that this is it this is all there is you know it's doggy dog world i have those two you know those feelings that that's it but, it's like i don't believe it as much because i've been passed that into more and into more so i don't know how it works so it doesn't potentially lock me in as much as it does, probably for a lot of people who are there their whole lives okay only taking you how long yeah i, i could get that practice i'm sorry i'm very slow i believe those sensei when he said not though you can do what i do and whatever he said a month three months something like that i believed him uh but it's taken me many years to get the sense of things okay i, call that my dumb factor live with it break through it i don't know do something thank you cynthia okay where the hell are we somebody yeah there's two voices jumping in before i think was there somebody else on something, yeah sensei it's dusty i just wanted to um thank you i guess i spent a lot of time in the car with my daughter i have a teenage daughter and so these teenagers sometimes they'll say things that, fragments me and kind of goes uh and i want to like immediately lash back but i hear this settle, and that's what i do i just kind of sink down and yeah the person that spoke earlier tonight it changes everything it's just all sudden like oh okay her it comes out differently or whatever it might be so um, thank you for that and then today i was driving with her and she's a huge taylor swift fan i don't know if you know the name taylor swift but a female musician that's been doing it for a while now well i was thinking about the pot of plant theory because taylor swift when she was 16. i want to make sure this is my question i want to make sure i'm on the right role here when she was 16 she came out and she was she was everything cam the people loved her she was a little pop singer, and then and then she kind of leveled out or whatever and then when she was 24 she got i guess a new pot and she became this sensation again but in a slightly different type of music she wasn't playing the same type of music that or writing the same type of music that she was eight years earlier and now she's 32 and she's making this music that is again brilliant and totally different than anything she's done in the past because she's like in a new pot yeah um yeah um is there a question in there dusty no my question okay my question is i want to make sure it's right is where does the soil come from the minerals come from what is it was created it's all there it was created in the beginning of creation, but in our littleness we're not really aware we get a little bit of course we're alive uh but there's it's all finer and there's endless amounts of it sometimes i call it the great warehou one aspect i call the great warehouse it's, filled with stuff it's there but i'm not aware of it when i'm small and tight to all intents and purposes it's not there it's not available but it is there and that's why i do a dimensional approach to get to finer dimensions where the finer energies the warehouse of stuff can begin to show and there's more and there's more and there's more uh, so, i don't know maybe some well that's my sense of it so it's kind of easy for me uh dimensional better next finer dimensionals finer next even finer wow and the stuff that's there if you're to check out the stuff that's there the beauty of it the harmony of it the joy of it the power of it the richness of it okay some people have learned to tap it that way so uh who bob thinking your way to riches thinking your way to reaches napoleon hill sensei yeah some people have learned tricks uh of how it works where they're able to tap it and actually tap it so they get very, talented rich it's, there it's all available uh i know it's hard for us who are in our sense and our experience of the limited of things uh we can hope that, happens we can we can hope that, happens we can pray god please but you learn how to actually, actually see oh sensei again we're just trying to show that look at i hit this level and there's actual protection there's actual harmony or there's actual power it was there he didn't create it he settled down opened up as you would went dimensional to where it could begin to show and be active not an idea or a belief or a uh i hope so i uh a nice idea uh he was showing the actual of it and that's where he was fantastic and that it's available to you he never said this is mine guy nobody else he'd say you can all catch on to this if you catch on to how it works just we're all a little dense or many of us, shouldn't say oh uh me and some others are kind of dense and it takes us a while, get the sense of it yeah okay, but yeah, so thank you yeah, and again and again we can't just do it with the idea of it that's important i just presented probably an idea but now you have to sit you have to open you have to deal with the energies get comfortable and realize it's okay and not be afraid of them and stuff so they can show their true colors everything if you sit with it will show its true color see what we see is a lot of crap yeah, but as you settle it open and settle and open and settle and open you begin to see the reality of that, was crap oh yeah you get some but you sit with it in a sitting format uh and it turns out after a bit to be fertilizer, a little finer oh my god it's life-giving but, look what you started with crap and it turns out to be fertilizer it turns out to be life-giving and whatever the more and more of fine and finer it's, there you have to do that just to believe all crap is god-given and it's beautiful it's just an idea there's no [Music] not enough of that okay yeah, yeah, that was that was a good go-around dusty thank you are we better for move into uh you all finished on whatever wherever we're at uh this sustaining, retaining, holding a certain level i guess uh upwards comes up it's been coming up again lately you've all probably had that question uh so who what when uh where why uh who sustains uh if you can't sustain yourself, uh at a certain level uh who did you become, uh what, happens that you can't sustain and if you can't sustain what happens then, uh when, does this happen is these particular, times yeah when do you personally feel more thrown off by things where you can't sustain uh, where, where, where are you and then where do you go when you can't sustain where, where why, why, i don't know why uh why can't you hold it uh, why do we get bumped out so to speak okay so i think there's a lot in who what when where and why what i'd like to hear tonight is, uh, your, versions your examples of the sustaining is that okay a word do we all sort of agree what we're talking about here is that been established and say this is lauren when you when we were talking about the these questions you kept asking you uh you uh what does it mean to people to sustain to sustain what yeah, okay let's start there so you talk about not being able to sustain so let's start there sustain what that's a question mark hello and people just open your mics and speak up please it's your night tonight i'm gonna try to stay back a little bit i'm trying hi sensei linda esken for me it feels like a certain level of energy, almost like um i know enthusiasm comes to mind but that's not really what i mean but um determination or yeah a little bit of power um and what it feels like to, lose that is sort of a deflation you know like energetically posturally but the, the what i would want to sustain is, being able to move forward in what i'm doing have a, reasonably good attitude feel energized where do you go when you get i don't know the word bumped out of there, when you can't sustain it where'd you go hmm the opposite of that yeah the opposite of that lack of energy feeling um discouraged feeling put upon uh being lazy yeah okay uh i, didn't want to get into answering uh i forget i'm not sure the word answering, uh your presentations um but on this one i'll say well don't forget the one by two by three by pattern it could be a simple one um yeah, thank you and this week i've been playing with all of this a lot and it's been really cool but that's sort of a nice one in, that you can the, deflation no power uh no energy is very obvious so it it's, not one that really kind of sneaks up on you and some cities you're not sure what's happening you're pretty clear on that oh god i don't get the energy you know i don't wanna yeah uh so it's kind of a nice one in that it's, clear when it's there clear when it's not there not subtle i should make it a bit easier to play with thank you so somebody uh your, form of sustaining or not sustaining uh sensei bob blob here if you look at any of the patterns you laid out last week so the one i relate to the most at the moment is uh that day fair day good day if you're having a good day maybe even a great day and then all of a sudden it just disappears, you know some minor thing happens that really shouldn't be a big deal okay so what happened where did you go where it disappeared what, happened in the disappearance where, did it go where did you go uh in terms of looking at the pattern you've gone from a good day or a great day to maybe a bad day you're falling down the ladder so to speak yes why, oh what should we do with that give us an example if you can nowhere you're you leave home you're going to work you got things pretty well under control at work yeah things are good at home and then somebody cuts you off in traffic and you lose short period of time okay again i didn't want to get into uh, how to cope with it i wanted uh, uh, how to cope with it i wanted uh, i wanted to have the variety of i had a feeling that there are different angles on not being able to sustain that we couldn't answer that problem with one format only kind of thing so i wanted to hear a variety of problems or questions about it yet but not necessarily answer them yet okay, so, what, am i saying help me yeah i think it would be good to hear other uh definitions that may help kind of give us a picture of what we're really looking at okay and, for example to start and start them going so i have an example this is elaine um, and this happened um i had a had a full load of clients set up in berkeley and i started driving over to berkeley from panama which is 40 miles and my tire pressure light came on [Laughter], which, you know it's maybe just simply means you pull off and you go to a gas station you put some air in your tires um but the tires were new you know so that was a bump and, it meant that um because i was like crossing the richmond bridge which is not a place where you want to get stuck in your car ever at all um i needed to figure it out you know before i crossed the bridge so there was this moment of oh my day is you know that was that was one of those situations where it just bumped me and kicked me out of you know feeling capable and okay, what's the next step and i got to next steps and resolved you know the problem but, i think that's an example of something you know something from outside my car you know making me feel like my whole day was shot again i wasn't going to go into handling the different cases i just wanted a variety but i get sucked in i'm sorry i don't know i get sucked in but something like that uh the situation has changed therefore the center of you the person has to change yeah so we're in a, previous oh boy i'm going to work again i feel good about it that uh suddenly being the light goes on uh, that situation you have to there is not you have to change there's a changing going on it's a law it changes the red light went on this is beginning to change okay i'm having a good day a two thugs approach me oh uh that changes are going on okay so i think uh someplace we have to go over that again or practice with that something, i'm not sure what to say now again i wanted to hear what you folks have to say but anyway quickly yes that's, my throat for a moment but uh help somebody yeah this is amy from florida um sometimes i find it's not a situation like my tires or my a relationship or something out there it's like i'm squared away i'm feeling aligned i'm feeling pretty good you know and then all of a sudden i feel this energy coming into my system like, like all of a sudden there's just this huge amount of energy and um i start reacting i'm not sustaining you know okay all right okay is it is it is it is it you're in a certain level pot and it and for whatever reason it's time to be in a next level of pot so the energy starts showing before we uh, we realize what's happening and, and use the potted plant theory to, work so you'll be okay again is, it something like, that where more energies are coming in from an unknown source it seems like yeah and i and i do, you know that's when i do, the practice because i you know because i'm losing it so, yeah it's definitely i definitely need thank you yeah again it's the same old doodoo where the hell are we with, this what what's your sense of it what's your problems with it have you learned any tricks so what's your so sensei is dave player sorry speak up please yes it is dave can you hear me that's better dave it's um for me it is says especially since moving to mexico as we have last month i've been here about a month of recognizing fear, keeps getting in my way of being present it keeps getting in my way of everything it, attaches me to different things too so i i'm fascinated i'd love to hear your feedback, uh again tonight i didn't want to get much into feedback i just wanted to hear the variety of problems and what you thought about it so i'm not sure i can't put my finger on um but it's there and it's i think it's a fear of life well i think it, parallels you know at the second that the tire light comes on it's like would you call that a rush of what we label as fear and or i, label it as fear yes since moon yeah i'm trying to um forgive me a second here trying to get my uh okay i'm trying to behave like lauren would like me to and show up when i talk okay um i was just saying that when the tire light comes on you know it was you know was that a elaine would we would we say like fear comes in or something like that but to me, one of the most brilliant pieces of what bob brought us for most sensei was wait a minute before you decided to have that experience with it, it was energy if you connect with it as energy in there so i'm sorry to get into conversation and i didn't mean to i just meant we were resident with fear as part of what goes on at the moment that we lose our sustaining our centeredness so i'll leave it there and let's hear from other people and thank you let me throw in that that's important uh that what i was going to do with you folks i was trying to figure out how to set it up not tonight but some class of, do the i have an idea i want to stand better you know that game we've done it a few times i'd like to stand better i really would like to stand better whatever standing better means and then we now the energies are mixing here they come their energies to facilitate standing better okay so far you all have done it yeah, noah, i should say yes that's right now what if you didn't know how it worked, okay and you were thinking i'd like to whatever better i'd like to whatever, better i'd like to whatever better and the energy start forming and start moving at you through you what would you call them you don't know anything about this what we know what would you call that nervousness at first there's a little tingling going on here what would you call it performing artists sometimes call it butterflies yeah when i was a kid we called it butterflies and you all have different names for it right okay, uh so i, i'm trying to uh support what moon was saying uh you call it fear but in their energies as richard pointed out uh get past those words because we put strange words on things that aren't that that's our reaction to those things but those things aren't that what are they really we have to sit and settle and open to all right first i feel them as fear okay good yes that establishes the lineup here, easy, what are you really or i played the say watching you said fear i heard that i felt it i experienced it what are you really saying and it may continue along that line for a bit like uh be careful okay i heard that [Applause] see what are you really saying and i'm sort of settling in an opening a bit what are you really saying and the tonality around the third fourth begins to change at first because it's beginning to change you don't trust it you think it's, a trick take you over easy, next one is even follows that better sense and it's even a bit better it's like whoa this is pretty cool uh so uh so, i think an important trick is that you uh realize you you're putting words on energy movement energy mixes and i, think it behooves us all i don't know hopefully you play with that, come to terms with it learn some of the tricks, i, tell you stories dumb stories over and over i want to go out and kill somebody i don't care who i'm going to kill okay that's me i, i can't continue living with that feeling so strong i want to kill because it put me in jail i'm too handsome to go to jail right what the hell is that and i sit with it what is that and it's red and it's raging and then it's a volcano already raging but, and i, forget the pattern now but i continued sitting apparently going dimensionally finer i wouldn't have used those words in those days but i was sitting within continuing with it got to a level where it was just power but it had no agenda didn't want to hurt anybody it was just power but my reaction to the power was i want to kill somebody that's why i tell you the dumb stories they're very important fear okay sit with it what the hell is it really and what does it really open to it open to its energies and they're intelligent they can dialogue settle an open and see what they have to say, take it in increments bob when i started with you there was a phrase you used to use hello energy i picked that up for most sense80 i think he used to welcome the energy welcome it welcome it so that was a carryover from sensei hello hey how you doing here hey talk to me other views of sustainability i'm sorry i was talking when you were company sorry sensei i think there are a few more people who have their mics open anybody wants to speak up uh hi sensei how are you doing this is andrew from san jose um i don't know if this counts but um at that time i never had a, managerial position and then um it was like four years ago uh this was at a non-profit that i was a member of and the head of the uh, district here in silicon valley asked me to be one of the one to ask me to be one of her managers i'd never been a manager i, kind of kind of was surprised and kind of wondering why she would pick me and stuff like that um, so when i went to one of my first teams i was kind of thinking what would they think of me first of all i was younger than many of them, and i had no experience even though i had been in the organization for a long time, um, and i kind of went in with a lot of doubts a lot of you know uh, what's uh what's the word imposter syndrome kind of doubting my own strength and stuff so after i was done this was like a year later um the same group of people i was in charge of five teams um but this very this particular one um he went up to me and he said um hey look you were the first manager that we ever had that visited us in like four years, um, and he said no you were particularly very well he, had a lot of praise for me um all right can i come to the chase here now that i don't know if this is a good example of what you were talking about but, okay, again i meant just to listen but you suck me in suck me in every time i try to get out you pull me back in oh anyway uh, your, situation you're offered the job yes, boom, the plant the plant the center the center is reacting the red light just came out in, elaine's case you're offered this bigger job yes, now there's a whole lot of energy presenting for the character that's the plan, to intake yes sounds like what you did was with this extra energy you let it continue out into, whatever you were saying yeah, and you can make up endless stories you got a lot of energy there this story and that story and he said and they said and i felt and ah the simple basics are as soon as you're offered the job and you're getting all kinds of boom you've been taught a pattern there are energies mixing up in your system to make you an actual manager i don't know the words there but an actual manager yeah you were offered the thing but you need this thing yeah they threw a bigger pot at you but now you've got to become a better plant, and that's all that was trying to go on but instead of being a better plant you went into it wasting your time wasting in a certain way wasting a lot of the energy the energy is just meant to, mix you up as hey yes, is that is that is that is that okay, uh what i was saying was that i got positive phrase when i actually doubted myself the entire time if you don't feel yourself you don't doubt yourself can i say i mean i mean david miller himself when he went in as a manager a million things a certain way because they're all based on you didn't deal with it here and now not to deal with and that gets endless okay therapists make a lot of money i should have taken up therapy they make a lot of money dealing with all those dot, dots, okay, yeah, if we don't [Applause], activate, if we don't experience let the energies mix and own them or be the plant those energies are going to push us into la, whatever land yeah, um yeah um yeah okay for now you're not happy um but i mean i guess i guess what i'm trying to say is that um the end result was much better than, expected yeah and it could have been an easier faster trip for you as all worked out well hey great it just could have been easier could have been uh with knowing how it works and activating properly ah you could have saved yourself a lot of time and energy not worrying about what you were presenting as your worries that that's all i'm saying it worked out uh thank god it worked out it just could have worked out faster and smoother and easier, when you know how to play the game a bit better that's all yeah thank you andrew yeah thank you so much what's the problem well okay so i, woke up at about five o'clock in the morning three days ago, because i knew that i had to tell the court that i had resolved an issue with it with an obstreperous client and the client had told me previously that the court had said client must do this and i told him the court says you have to do this and he said, i'm never going to do that you're my lawyer it's your job to get them to agree and i said well you're telling me that it's my job to get the judge to not enforce the laws of the state of california i don't think he's going to do it do it so i wake up at five in the morning you moved closer to your microphone please ross it's a little difficult is that better thank you i mean if i get any closer my face will be in the can you hear me it's okay thank you all right so at five in the morning i get up and, what had happened was my mind had taken over because i had turned my client into something that i had aversion towards you know like i turned my client into the problem and i, had taken myself out of the center of energy and so and so i just said this is not going to work if i if i approach my client thinking that he's the problem it's not going to work i need to sort of clear myself and get to a deeper a deeper space and view this differently or let go of my aversion and my preconceptions about it so i just sort of hung out by myself i you know i had a cup of decaf coffee and you know stuff like that and then i don't i don't something shifted so that by the time i called him called him i mean we had a lovely conversation and i got him to completely change what he was doing and the court was fine they gave us a short continuance and you know so the whole thing worked once i shifted my energy and i knew the energy was wrong because i woke up in the morning thinking about this stuff and i was kind of um short-tempered with myself and just sort of situations around me but i knew also that if i just sort of followed i think this was the you know good day medium day i mean bad day medium day good day i kind of turned it from in my mind what was going to be a very bad day also what i heard ross was uh he's the problem but you're smart so you went that's not cool, i gotta do something with me as you did something with you then you're at a better level and problem worked out apparently yeah but you had to stand in the middle of it eat it let it mix through you yeah a lot of people know how to do that they're afraid of their own energy mixes and stuff so it's much easier for some people they're the problem they always will be it's them it's them it's them it's like yeah but you talk about them a lot must be something has to do with you, know but people don't want to be here and now with themselves because they a they a they have an aversion to the depths of the energy the underworld of energy this really gorgeous people it's gorgeous but at first it could be icky poo it's, it's not fertilizer at first it's, again i tell you the stories me and the snake pit okay uh, so yes to, remember is really bugging you, unfortunately we have to come back to us [Applause], well that's kind of the beauty of it too you know because you can take full responsibility for what you do and the growth that that's important the, growth where in a certain way you grew, i don't know with your words but from a an angry lawyer you grew to a i don't know, something, more yeah you have a word for, peacemakers i grew into a center grounded kind person tell me about you kind person, tell me about you kind person you're a kind person give me a little bit more kind person well reconciliation yeah just like approaching others as, you know as deep people on their own like not he wasn't he was no longer a function of my life i didn't have to have him work out for my project it was i'm a per i i'm a deep person i will communicate with you in a in a and i think kindness is important um because i approached him in a very open uh non-judgmental and non-demanding way and, like at the end of the whole thing this, whole thing took about 20 minutes and i didn't even understand how it worked out as well as it did but the shift was in me it was it was me before i even picked up the phone that day and all i was asking there ross was who were you this plant let's go back to the powder plant as a plant who were you and you threw out the word kindness like i was kinder like okay but i'd like a little bit more you me maybe you as a lawyer you as somebody that's ingested more energies and are being enhanced right and not seeing not seeing the separate players as, fully separated and not seeing them as problems but seeing the things as a cohesive energy matrix that can work together as long as you put the right energy into it okay and the moon throughout the world um moon what where it just wrote uh reconciliation yeah, for conciliation i mean it's just it's getting, the parts to work seamlessly together and it and you do it by having a deep energy yourself that people trust if you're not at that level how can that happen in the circle world that you're in well that's, the quickly yeah that you're setting a tone i just spoke with tony uh yeah those of you old-timers would remember tony piazza world famous at this point mediator and he said it was oh that's the word i was looking on be a good boy okay am i am i showing yet am i here okay, now i can talk thank you lauren okay so tony just said that the whole thing he had learned and i, picture in my mind cooling rods in a nuclear plant but he said is just take the reactivity out so the natural intelligence of the people can work thank you anyway to go from uh, uh an angry type lawyer angry at them uh to somebody who can get conciliation there's a lot of personal growth you're not an angry lawyer now you're uh ah, the one who reconciliation goes on in aikido that's a pretty good nugget at a certain level things go on smoother and harmoniously now, anyway, so yeah thank you what's the problem i have something but i don't know if it was a problem this is amy from oakland ate from oakland um i wasn't i didn't necessarily was here last week because i, was doing something else but i couldn't come but i recently did a physical activity it was for a certification and i had to achieve a certain thing and it took me it took me weeks and weeks of preparation for that physical activity and there was a i was suffering through injury like i had some shoulder thing i had this thought of self-doubt that maybe i'm not gonna pass this thing and, that i was swarmed within that self-doubt there was um shoulder pain or whatever but deep down there was something, that, knew that everything was gonna be okay and that i could do it and it was not necessarily a like a popcorn or sorry it was not a potted plant thing but it felt more like a popcorn thing like there's you know you're stewing in this oil and there's stress and there's difficulty but really there's this kernel of kernel of something that can transform and so keeping, sustaining that feeling was crucial and important for me so even though i'm swarmed in all this stuff there's still that seed of and i can do it i know i'm gonna do it and it's good and even though the body pains and stuff were there and obvious it's like yeah no kind of yeah, yeah could i could i suggest or wonder if that inner thing isn't uh, what we're calling easy the eye self, clearer uh that the, self is there a little closer i don't know what words he used up a little closer a little more present has been allowed a bit in the past so it's in the neighborhood and, when things got the self said hey, from my perspective it's going to be okay mm-hmm so thinking maybe that was a self-sense that could be there, was also touching base twice a day so every morning every evening i would you know do the process and reconnect and kind of just give it time and that really was essential i mean the practice is important, how'd the cut kettlebells go that's, what it was right so i passed i got certified and i yeah there was me that knew that i was gonna do it and then there was a me that was self done and yay linda's all like yeah she knows i'm, from the old school a certain certificate in kettlebells i i'm from the old smelly gyms where guys, oh you'd like it i'll, show you someday um oh when we do the process by the way all along the way the i easy self easy self definer of self is, moving along in, that process so when you do a bobby to a robber the, the eye, has opened a little bit when robert goes to nado it continues so if it follows i don't know how to say this right now but it follows the same pattern, uh maybe one day we'll work on that tried to bring that out clear i'm just filing it away for myself anyway thank you amy okay when do they knock you out of whatever you were trying to hold could we say uh what happens when you get knocked out where do you think you go when you get knocked out uh what do you think keeps you from going back going back to that level not to say you should go back to that exact same place uh but, something let alone that you guys talk what's with that um, i hate to be chatty but you know what sessom said earlier say like well what do you do and you know you're gonna have an argument with somebody or something so like you get thrown and you have to know that you've been thrown and you have to realize that some you know you'll find whatever little signs in yourself to tell you you're not operating the way you that in the way you're used to operating or in the way that you, would like to be operating so you so you do whichever of our techniques or whatever particular you know spiritual physical technique you use to get back to a place where you feel like you're okay, i don't know but when we when we had um back at turk street years and years ago somebody had stuck on the wall a little um a little what do you call a fortune cookie fortune and it said don't let unexpected events throw you and it was up there the whole time that, school was there and it's kind of true you know like stuff like i know as a lawyer like i come to my co-work and i think oh i got a great day it's going to be you don't know what's going to walk in the door so you better have techniques to get yourself back to an even keel whatever they are you know you know but i don't it's to think you wrote unless you're really, advanced things are going to throw you throw you and it's your job to know you've been thrown and get back to your good place yeah and that's why we practice rolling right yeah, yeah, thank you thank you uh yeah it's not that you won't get thrown but one of the tricks will be realizing we've been through and how to get back to a proper place okay so it may not be exactly the same place you were before you got thrown but the coming back to a place should be that place level of you uh, that is appropriate to the situation okay i, think sometimes people try to they're in they're in a certain identity or feeling of uh feels good and they get thrown and they try to get back to that same exact feeling but doesn't it depend on what's through you, uh, if that situation is still in effect still there that what you're coming back to is a different mix that will be comfortable with itself not the mix you had before when uh elaine's red light went on it may be starting to mix up oh i gotta change my tire kind of thing i got to be a mechanic or something here and then things are starting to mix okay because that could happen okay, but to try to come back to i'm the person going to work looking forward to my good day at work the situation has changed therefore the centered person okay and anyway i think sometimes people get a little confused with trying to go back to exactly the same nice feeling they were having and, don't take into consideration but is it exactly the same situation or something changed there or, what so that's one of the things you should play with ponder sensei what who does andrew again um could uh could a good example of this be like um i mean let's say you're dating and um let's say that relationship didn't work out and you're going to the next relationship um, you know you know yourself a little bit better you're kind of you know what to look for know what things to avoid and then and then you may know what to look for in a different person and so your next relationship should be a little bit different or maybe even better would that be a good example of what you're talking about it's been so many years let me let me mold back into the issue anybody want to answer him on this give me a break i was actually going to come back to you a second ago andrew because that shift into that larger um identity with more responsibility when i met you bob i don't know if you remember i used to run the wild mountain cafe, and, and it was um and the whole squad that was so that came in and trained and all that it was like an overwhelming thing to me and the that why bring back your little thing when, you taught me to say hello energy at those moments that i just wanted to whatever go off in the ways that i shouldn't as a manager or leader that, one little piece alone which is aikido that was just essential that was great and i think andrew probably that that's what came through from your training in the fact that you were successful yep anybody else please last uh last few well my response to andrew is that it depends if you can learn from your relationships failures like ross was saying you have to recognize that you've been thrown, you can get up and do it again but did you learn anything from the experience like what went wrong with the relationship that it broke up so that the next time it's different you know so you have to learn from these experiences as they go along in order to uh not keep repeating the same mistake but uh that's, a normal grown up uh dealing with relationships you know i don't think there's any secrets here i'll defer to nado sensei about this further well yeah i, just would go more into the uh, uh okay so uh okay so uh something doesn't work out okay it didn't work out uh circumstance energies to the center the mix up and down center with those energies, to be to be a better person in eight similar situations i'm saying it good am i uh, that it's not just learning from that i mean it's better nothing but i'd like to put the whole system into the development uh i'm not saying you will tonight let me shut up anybody anything before you finish up here, no sensei you were you're on a good you're, going somewhere bro you keep going no fertilizer anyway see since i tried to bring it out he said something it's one of those things that, lauren shows uh if you fail that could be really cool why because you go back to the center plant taking in the new ingredients they mix a better character who is who is different than the person who failed at that it's a different mixed person it's still me but it's some things have been added some, new minerals i didn't have or nutrients i didn't have they're suddenly there and that makes me more whatever aware, uh more uh more harmonious with the other person more whatever so the actual energy involvement growth as opposed to just, learning things is, where i, prefer this or to me this is critical this actual improvement thing actual improvement thing um it says i have a sense of the energies how the energies work i think we're back to potted plants if the plant is, a little ah in essence it's saying out to the circle hey i feel a the soil circle, comes in with the proper nutrient that the center plant character, ingests, [Applause], and it changes and suddenly uh the er that the plant earlier had it doesn't happen now because it's ah it's got these nutrients in the mark huh, and on and on and on and on and on and on yeah, is that, do it now say the, oh sensei quote that we use in the slide is failure is the key to success each mistake teaches us something yes if we do what i just said yes what i learned about that there's not enough growth with that this center to the circle and circle to the center the actual, put it in your body this thing is critical, critical so i'm not on people's case no i am uh yes i understand learning from your whatever but to uh touch the level of yourself that takes care of that problem that's the real work don't know if i said it well again ah i'm putting it up uh we're getting close to the end here or we are at the end anything before we finish up did we do was that have any value on it we'll talk next week a little bit more if you want anybody's last thing something let's say this is a t-shirt here any teacher there ben uh yeah i've really enjoyed this uh watching and experiencing this uh this process and i think it's a good launching pla place i don't think we're nearly done with this yet i, didn't think we would be i was thinking of this as a two weekend series i think it may it may well be because we can get a little bit more out from this and, then uh and get a little bit i think there's uh there's more to uh harvest in this yeah i'll tell you my original intention uh which was to hear the variety of ways that you can't sustain or what you do uh to uh to retain sustaining or whatever, whatever, the who what when why whatever uh and just hear quite a few of those and then maybe the next week then we could lay out some uh layouts of, how to deal with them with them that was sort of my intention but again i get sucked in and i was throwing some stuff out which i didn't want to do i wanted just to have these variety of angles on angles on sustaining or not being able to sustain sustaining or not being able to sustain or whatever and uh and give you a little bit a week a week to melanoma and then come back next week with oh here's some basics that i think could help or whatever that's that was my intention but you know what intentions are so i've heard thank you thank you have we had it for tonight i think sensei unless somebody has something urgent they want to speak up uh, we're just coming up close to uh here's joanna, who has come in before the end go ahead joanna really thank you very much uh well as we work dimensionally i'm, working slowly on this um but i have been working lately i sent you some stories about plants but uh i think finally i really felt the experience of, uh digging in with my own roots in my own land um, and what i notice is what kind of pot are we talking about are we talking about are we talking about the outer parts that i was really uh imagining before having the idea but what kind of inner parts of my own that i have um it was like before i was thinking okay am i restricting my, growth too much am i just query uh squaring myself in a square part and not letting me grow or then should i use my own thoughts to kind of um kind of um envelop and, follow my own growth so how do we play besides the, earth and the nutrients that we that we have with our own parts of owen yeah i don't have out there physical parts this is inner work yeah all right so center and circle inner is there's a finer dimension of center, i'll give the impression of being a little bit bigger let you know you're moving into the next dimension and continue again and there's a finer center circle following the potted plant theory it's inner interdimensional yeah uh, it'll be i don't know something like i don't know what i'm talking about right now but somebody who's got an acre of land and it's not enough so he uh, buys five acres and it's not enough and he owns a whole house the country and it's not enough uh, this outer thing is i don't know is there some limitations on it or something but the inner thing is, a creation size it's vast and in its vastness dimensionally it gets, finer and finer, and finer better and better, and better but you have to make that journey so for me the pop is inner circumference the plant center is inner center okay yeah something to develop yeah thank you very much and thank you joanna and thank you joanna and thank you everyone for speaking up today and nado sensei thank you very much for once again, for class for class and we'll see everybody next week for sustainability part two thanks essay great session thank you thank you lauren you're very welcome thank you everyone david flater it's nice to see you settled thank you dr hair it's good to feel settled and be here appreciate it over and out yeah i just wanted to say to danny it's great to see that you're with us today yes very much so thank you same danny thanks from us dennis lovely to see thanks everyone been lying down thoroughly enjoying the uh, the whole presentation and what everyone had to say it's been wonderful good to hear your voice right thanks see you again bye okay

## Continuation: How to Sustain ???

**Date:** Unknown date

one thing is you caught on to in going inner definer that you had been doing it in a uh as if it was a small size inner and there was a realization no it's yours yeah it, seemed to take me a, a long time to understand that what, you were talking about when you it's here it's here we could say it's here it's here we could say it's here goddammit it's here i still maintain that it was here in my way that when i went in internally to find this healing place if you like it was never it was always quite difficult to find somehow, until i cottoned on that hey it's actually here and it's huge and it's everywhere have contact with it and feedback from, it in a very strong way um, especially, uh in uh in the time of against facing your own death and i'm coming to terms with that okay the second part that caught my attention uh and we'll go over what you just said about the realization that there's much more room here um was uh, for like a word you bumped into self and self had something to say yeah self was previously at times with my dialogue and that's another thing about it is that it didn't take a whole bunch of dialogue and i would go in looking like self, self going hey i'm over here i'm over here in fact it was here it was here not over here it was actually here, here um what was your question sorry uh, that it said something you said something you self said something that danny heard self said something about let's get with it, are you ready to stay alive here or something yes it was certainly around that, time where i knew that in the next two or three days i was going to die if something didn't happen and yes that's a good point it was around that time that sorry okay self said let's get with it danny the person you want to stay alive here i am let's get with it yeah not yours yeah it was a lot like that things began to change like little things like attempting to walk or going to the toilet were pointed out to me as big things they didn't seem like big things for me nothing seemed to me they had to be pointed out that way and it was pointed at how, good i was looking how good i was sounding all these all these posts that i was unable to see and others had to show me and, now in there is no attempt i feel to find self really, my, self is available at all times to everyone you're here because it's here, here, okay, yeah okay thank you danny i think that was a big part of deciding to live yeah, yeah thank you thank you thank you okay so basically from my view basically what happened was first this correction of uh going inner a tendency to keep its small inner it's, behind my belly button inner finer and then inner finer opens up to the level realm it's in now you've got this big size, inner, big size big size so danny caught on to that okay now in that uh bigger size space, self that's there it's more clear to us that oh self is that i'm self and then we continue with as we continue a finer level of self a clearer self eventually i'll throw the word transparent self at you maybe one day we'll see and self as part of yourself is intelligent about itself okay oh i, oh i, don't know if i'm diverging i talked to danny self a while back i just to see what he what himself was up, to and he was at a choice place there he was right in the middle of did he want to continue as retaining danny mcintyre the person body that we know and love or was he going to continue on his journey and pass on and move on to other realms, he was at a choice place so, to me what sounded nice was uh where him in experiencing his own self and his own self said you want to continue let's go i'm raring to go here and what seemed to facilitate was that realizing the inner self has plenty of room the inner space inner finer has plenty of room so he might have been in doing it too small not being able to be aware of himself experience itself hear himself uh because it was maybe a little small but, inner finer to a larger finer dimension i don't know if i'm saying that well but you got the sense now one caution as usual uh inner finer and there's, this very large very large world that you're in or dimension that you're in be careful of just wow and going out wow look at how big it is and you lose you become aware of it but you lose the presence the you lose the center and you're wow look at that big circle okay so i caution you there careful of wow, how beautiful it is whatever, whatever, and you will see some fantastic things but you don't want to get caught up in just your awareness because then you lose that center ever, ever character that continues uh again don't know if i'm saying it well i hope you caught that yeah okay ah moving on moving on uh, what's tonight a continuation of last week, um after having giving it given it some thought, uh we were on uh you've got a let's say um you're experiencing yourself at a at a fair nice level you're enjoying yourself and then for some reason you get bumped out of there you lose it and that was sort of the question comments about that direct questions or direct experiences or any tricks of the trade that you have let's, start things going on, what we call sustaining a certain level of character [Music] microphone hello yeah, so i uh so i uh use quite a bit of, settling and opening ground for me becomes a big reference, point that helps me to sustain or maintain a certain state of being availability and besides trying to refresh often um to maintain because i never know when something might come up and then i'll be jostled, um, i frequently check in with my feet my feet ground feet ground roots as a reminder of presence ground and that may lead me closer to potted plant than some of the others that you've mentioned, but that helps me a lot if i'm feeling a bit, um agitated or there's a little bit more going on than maybe i was available for i settle back to my feet and then ground and open from there and that usually brings me back to something a little bit more articulate if you will okay, okay um there was one uh practice i used to fun run with when i was in tokyo uh at home dojo and uh and uh i would pick a body part uh for me if i'm in my nose it's a lesser me, have a little more back a little bit better me so uh so uh i would go into class and just check myself out and see sort of what level i was at using the body reference game and if it was back and that felt pretty good i would do the whole hour of class as mr back as mr back no matter what the technique was there's mr back doing ekil mr back doing nikhil mr back doing shiho nage not an idea an actual back presence and i would uh so my practice was uh retaining that and it was easy to get back to if i momentarily lost it and of course you would momentarily lose it in the flurry of movement around uh but easy to get back to and i think i probably did hope entire days as mr back another day i'd be a little bit better and be down into more of the hip area and for me again back is fine hips are better lower whatever and i do all my techniques as mr hips a really good day was mr fee feet contact every technique feet, technique feet technique, feet technique and again run the whole class with that if i lost it momentarily of course it was easy to get back to was tangible so a little game i, used to play that in retrospect was a good game you brought it up by mentioning roots going for your feet roots yes it's a quick aside um i, you know i, was uh at a social gathering earlier this week and um somebody an aikido colleague a friend of mine here in miami who trained um at one of your workshops here now 15 years ago more or less he overheard what i was saying to somebody at the party about process and professional development something of that nature he immediately knew that's bob nado's stuff right and he, said and, and the guy was like what do you what do you mean who's that what do you mean by that and he said well you know and he, proceeded to do a, one by two by three a quick example immediately off the cuff of what that is and i thought that was pretty cool because he hadn't trained with you for about 15 years and that was his like that was his go-to i thought it sticks it's so yeah you know anyway thought you'd appreciate it hopefully thank you yes nice, i like to hear things like that uh, or to get a letter i get a few now and then somebody that i don't know uh attended a little a little workshop on centering you know a little afternoon session or something and, we'll write back umpteen years later and say wow i've been playing with that for 15 years it's really great and i'm progressing well my life is better but i just kind of nice to hear yeah okay people retention not being able to retain what are you retaining uh if you get bumped why are you getting bumped what just happened that you got bumped what's going on where do you go bob uh one of the things we talked about years ago there was an exercise that we did, where, uh we imagined say walking up to a door you may be on a date and you know you're in a certain state you walk up to that door and immediately you know there's gonna be a rush of energy and, all sorts of you know nervousness and so forth and that's when you take that moment and, re-center and, prepare for the new situation and what i find is we're constantly um, experiencing new situations i was just walking uh today came into the house and, and just became aware that, i was in a new situation it seems it seems kind of minor but, yet uh i had i had to do a whole different number so it involved new energy new centering and being prepared for that new situation so uh it's, just if you make it a little clearer for us because you walked into your same old house could i say and yet it was a new situation could you clarify that a bit yeah okay so i was out walking, just walking down the street and just getting some exercise uh so i'm in a certain mode and you know i open the door come into the house and you know i'm gonna i'm gonna throw off my shoes i'm maybe make some lunch etc, i can't even remember what the activity was but it was next it was okay what's next and, because there was a new situation there was going to be new energy to deal with that new situation okay so you weren't a walker anymore exactly okay so people this is a small change but uh i think he's saying he's he likes the small changes because it gives him a reason to practice or reminds him the practice i believe is what he's laying out here yeah the most obvious when we did it years ago it was really dramatic that, walking up to the door uh, to, come into your you're clearly walking into a new situation and when you do uh you know we tend to just rush into it and forget to re-center and, kind of eat that new energy dealing with the new situation, if, we can refuse that diagram there if we could realize that a situation calls up calls up or will provide different energies that the center character you has to uh do something with okay, so different situation center changes, or vice versa center changes and you want a different situation so you move yeah are we okay there it's okay steve you're okay with that yeah, exactly that's exactly what i wanted to say yes okay uh, so yeah even i, kind of like playing small things as reminders, uh that's sort of my old uh mantra was a uh, practice in the summer so it'll be there in the winter don't wait for some immense thing to be happening and try to contend with it if you have no practice dear god i hope you can pull it off i hope you luck out but so practice with the small things that's like practice in the summer okay, uh little things that you're really in a certain way you really don't have to adjust for do it for the practice do it as a reminder i know a lot of things you don't have to do just for i'm going to wash the dishes i don't have to adjust that's too simple okay or go for a walk i can just go for a walk i don't have to adjust but it's a practice time going to go for a walk take a moment you're just changing your situation and the energy is mixing up to create a walker, who'll be more comfortable walking more aware of what he's walking or what he's seeing while he's walking uh he use those small things as practice okay so when the major big changes happen uh you know an earthquake my god the situation is changing you know if the building's starting to tumble a bit uh, you you've got the basics down okay boom, boom and you'll probably react better because they're more in harmony situation core center, situation, core center, situation okay so you're not the person that stands there and, freezes while the building falls on them okay or walks around in circles because i'm supposed to do something they don't know what to do so they're just going round and round and round and they ain't helping anybody they're not helping themselves they're not able to help anybody else kind of thing so practice with the small stuff it's fun i find it fun hopefully i'm a big advocate for working with the small and ordinary like you say but i, found something additionally helpful, nine times out of ten that ordinary thing is what it is but the tenth time it's different somehow and you won't be surprised when it is okay yeah we tend to take things for granted is all i'm saying i come home and it's friday and this is what i expect but it's not somehow and i'm you know i'm in my head about it not even knowing but you know practice because that the you know 99 out of 100 sure but that one time you'll be blindsided otherwise even with the ordinary stuff yeah i get a lot out of that that's all and we mentioned that uh that was for example uh the story about the uh old time japan uh the guy's so uh, a samurai class of course and he's very wealthy so uh and he's got a big garden so at nighttime let's go out into his garden and walk and enjoy his garden but he's so rich he's got a young guy that carries his sword for him and the young kid thinks haha even though he's a master i've got the sword i could get him at which time the master goes something's wrong there's an enemy in the gates here quick hand me my sword situation change just the kid thinking about i could get him situation change the master being sensitive could feel these energies moving around and there were warrior energy so figured there's an enemy in the gates kind of thing so that's where those stories are useful or interesting somebody where are we on sustaining not sustaining getting bumped why when where what, i said say it's autumn, i was gonna call on you eventually, oh good gotcha um so i find in my line of work there's a lot of pressure and that can really be the bump and sometimes that's perceived pressure that is, um like fear-based sure right and sometimes it's just that there's a lot going on and, there's, a lot going on and, there's not a whole lot of communication and um and um being aware of that changing situation that is shifting like, micro motor moment micro moment is really, tricky and especially at a new level um so i find especially with you know finding this new layer of self that can handle that situation something that you said last week is really helpful but sometimes the um like the trusting of it isn't all or the um like being able to, experience it sure like on my own and practice it great but or like even at the dojo even better and i'm getting there and i'm getting definitely no shortage of practice in life but there's a sense of um that carryover where i feel like yeah i don't know exactly what's happening when it's not kicking in but it's not kicking in you know it's not going this is this is it uh anyway trust uh since i said when you go into big time work on this i said the trust thing comes up really strong can't believe it changed that fast you don't you don't trust it you, question it you, try to check it out and you screw it all up so in the very advanced, advanced levels uh, when it gets real magically fast when you people hit that level uh, there'll be that potential to doubt or slow it down or question it uh trust okay um, anyway is there a character that does that is there, is that worthwhile to practice as well oh, uh, where are we going yes [Applause] as this self all along the way self is, re returning, back to the better levels of itself okay, there's a point where the self begins to trust the center circle of things the trust of how it's mixing is fine and it doesn't interfere you get an eye which is a tight self and even she's worried about everything he interferes he questions it he wants to make sure he wants to double check okay, uh so easy the eye clearer self uh that, that really helps, okay, if that helped daddy um yeah so when the director you back on there okay let me see your face bring her back on there, there you go when the director uh, wants say you got a character that you're playing okay and the director says uh tone it down a bit or ease back a bit the character heard that and the character, begins to naturally change to be a little, more subdued in its presentation or vice versa the director says pick up the pace there and we need more uh easy and the and because of that situation the director directing uh the, centered character you, boom, boom and start to put on a bit more you know flower flashier whatever the director wants um so again that's how it works situation change give me less situation change, give me less situation change give me more the, center character the uh the character of which you've made room for easy, easy, you allow a character to form and that character uh will adjust to the director's uh comments is that i say that oh okay that i use the proper terminology yeah and also i mean at least in actors terms kind of what you're talking about the situation changes if the director is asking you to tone it down you're, taking it from maybe a life and death situation to a slightly less like you're easing, the, maybe not the eye but the situation yeah and the character will naturally adjust if it's a down tempo time will adjust by down tempoing it or adjust by picking up the pace with it uh that should be a natural happening because you're allowing it to happen and it's a natural happening, this to that and that to this center circle, the center so again as we get more practice again, as we get more practice again trust comes in uh you kind of know it's, it's working and, again after all you don't have to double check and think about it and, and uh, get a lot of feedback it's like boom this is it because you trust it trust it one way i trusted is uh, seeing in a very simple form let's see simple form if this uh, game is raising my arm against that dumb one if the game is raising my arm easy i'm at a better level just to say let me ch am i how do i know i'm at a better level how, do i know i'm not making it up but not now it's so forget about it play the game at a better level oh i didn't feel any strain from the shoulder, i don't know if it was a beautiful arm moving but it moved easy [Applause], implying i'm settling more in opening more i'm at a better level oh, a little bit of float to it, was almost a little bit like something lifted it up and it's a i think a little prettier is a little bit prettier i think it had a little longer extension we'll see i continue uh so where am i going with that oh as i just settle with a sense of opening it, improves i can feel it it's improving i can tell the difference between here how do i how long do i have to keep proving to myself that if i settle and open it won't be better how many years do i have to keep proving it, okay so in a very simple practice there's my proof three four settles and it's very obvious the armor is getting better i trust it okay, uh anyway i love that uh so situation is just kind of a good basic one for everybody situation changes the centered uh character you also is trying to change it's a law or vice versa as the character develops better and better the surroundings will change or you need to change you you'll say i got to get out of this small town i, can't something's interfering with my, growth here for me the characters growth, here for me the characters growth so you change your circumstances you get out of town and move to the city okay so there's another a very simple way of looking at, the main part, of, sustaining or adapting to the changes sustaining i don't know the words here it's not like we get to a good place we hang on to it for dear life forever be ready to contend with the changes because the center circle pattern are always going it's on of a um moment-to-moment game instead of like holding on to some idea of like enlightenment god yes kill those words bang, i don't like those words i don't that beautiful idea i guess when i'm because of the longevity sustainability aspect you're thinking like oh well this will just be here yeah in that you're in this moving thing center circle, the center let's just use that and as things happen within that center circle circular center there is a law, it, it it's trying to work so i ease the eyes so i don't interfere with the workings mr let it work is that kind of the um that circle to center, to circle um, that allows that law to just be there yeah, yeah, i want it to be there yeah so it can work cleanly because if i get tight and i check i'm, interfering with this you just clog the pipes the pipes are dying to work that's how they work they want to work why don't they work as well as i'd like them because i'm hanging on and i'm, now suddenly a blockage in it's the pipes roto-rooter man ease of the eye you see the eye ah are we on anything if we kill that subject great thank you oh i hope uh i wanted to say something uh my uh autumn my sense of, an actor, okay, my side it's somebody who catches on to being clear, okay and being clear then enables the character to form and you're just clear you're the stage in a certain way at that time you just clear stage so the character necessary for that role can start to form okay, all right all right you've heard have i mentioned this on a friday night if you're an actor per se and you hang on to this i'm an actor you might be interfering with the clearness that's necessary so the character can be there you might be like too present are you following me yeah another adage is that the right word of mine is you can't get pregnant if you're pregnant you should catch that if you're somebody it's hard for somebody to be born all right i'm sorry i used dumb is adage the right word people adage yeah yes, okay, uh, so, uh, did i ever mention a story some friends of mine were into uh acting and i uh asked me to go along with them to their uh acting school and so i had a little interest there and i was hanging out with oliver stone around that time i think and i attended this lecture by this well-known i don't remember her name lady, uh the audience a lot of people in the audience it was a theater kind of thing it was it was close to full all these aspiring actors you know and stuff listening to her every word and one guy threw up a problem that he had he said i, i enjoy nice guy characters but if it's a bad guy character i can't handle that she said yeah i've heard that many times before and she didn't know what to say back to him even though she had heard it many times through the years okay, see if this young man being a nice guy probably and to allow energies of a bad guy character, he couldn't do it because he was already somebody clear, clear, the role situation the script calls for a character easy, and the character will start to form and be the proper character okay so therefore it's a bad guy it's not different it's just because you're clear the character just forms and when the show is over you clear and you're you, don't retain bad guys stuff that's screwy what will they do when they do that uh so to be so my sense is an actor should just be one who is well versed in clearing and being so clear any character can come up fully and establish itself and because of the fullness of the character and all the proper energies are, there how that character moves how he speaks when he pauses the little turn of his eye everything will be like perfect potentially because, there's no interference with the new mixing of the character to me that's a great actor is it is that you don't have to buy that just my take from what little i know i buy it absolutely so i guess we all sort of come around another angle all have to be careful on, having a set identity, it might be hard to let go of that when i'm bobby there's nothing else but bobby in bobby's world really tight on that how can robert begin to show it's virtually impossible okay so after a while uh in this easy the eye finer more open self all that facilitates allowing a better level of you or in your job allowing a character fully, fully okay anyway so all of us have to be careful of hanging on to our body okay easy the eye let go of that a little fear but i don't know what i'm what's gonna happen yeah, yeah, yeah, it's just gonna be better how do i know that well you've done the arm race 87 times, once a day for three weeks come on of course when you settle it's going to be better whatever it is i'm starting to diverge uh anyway particular problems or on the who what when why of sustaining, retaining a character, uh you i sense say it's tom hey you tom hey um i really enjoy the process and that's basic of clearing you, asked it's come up at the dojo has come up in your teaching and the whole concept of sustaining somehow, makes it feel like we're holding on to something too light too tight yeah for too long sustained by definition means we're we've got to hold on to something for a long period of time and that takes away from the fun of the game it becomes a job you've always said don't, it's not work yeah you don't want to turn it into a job but i do i do really love the practice of clearing and, being allowing myself to be present in a situation with somebody with something with some event whether i anticipate it or it's spontaneous the clearing process allows me to be present, at the moment and fully experience as you say the character yeah fully experience the character if we're holding on to something too tight that doesn't even reference the situation that we're in right now so yeah no i the word clearing in whatever form you, clear clearing in whatever form you, clear you know you different people clear uh let's ease the eye clear or hey let it all go [Applause] more room more room sense of an emptiness maybe it's okay it's okay it's okay so yeah in whatever form you use that word clearing cool i'm gonna have to admit to my old age i'll be back in two minutes uh who wants to jump on somebody want to jump on noah you've got something to say i was talking with sensei earlier today and, one thing that came up relates to the what of those questions on there and it has to do with looking for signs of what the energies of change are pointing toward are they pointing toward downtime in which case you might respond differently than if the energies of change are pointing toward you know going from a two by two to a three by three or uh whatever version of upgrade might be in the uh in the mix i thought that was an interesting thing trying to recognize what the energies of change are, in the sense of what direction or what type of change is in the offing so, one of the examples i talked with him about on the phone was your response in the very early part of these series of classes he spent a lot of time with us talking about downtime especially as it related to the virus and the fact we couldn't go out and everything, and that kind of response to the what will be different than the response like autumn was talking about, going from this type of character to that type of character or as justin was talking about going from a two by two to a three by three things like that so i thought that was an interesting area of really trying to read what those energies are in terms of then what the appropriate response to them is okay bob yes sensei yes sensei glad you're back good oh, oh what to say about getting older i hate to talk about getting older [Applause], you know how many years it took me to take advantage of the discounts for older people i'd rather spend the extra money oh that's me ah okay where the hell are we people say something intelligent say something semi-intelligent sensei this is uh liam uh i'll go for i'll select semi-intelligent for before um just from what was recently talked about and just being um working on sustainability um, just kind of working from and just what was just said uh looking to the side looking to the signs of energy, change what they're pointed toward using your reference from last week who what when where why uh at least initially i was watching the video earlier today it's new to me but uh feels really helpful in asking those questions when, there's a bump in addition to that from my own practice kind of observation reflection on when those bumps occur is i'll notice there, will be an imbalance between say my internal energies and the external energy say of the situation either a kind of a recognition out of whack or out of tune not a touch we have a lot of ways we phrase that huh yeah, and so um so kind of that, point uh looking to the signs the who what where when why uh what is the change pointing toward if the, say in the potted plant theory if the external um energies have kind of said now you're in a bigger pot but the internal energies are like i'm not ready to grow into this or the opposite like the external energy says your pot is only this big the internal energies are saying i'm ready to be bigger how to kind of still keep that level of sustainability um, kind of when those circumstances occur, is my question yeah right, actually liam this is lauren could you rephrase the question more succinctly please, i was checking with my guy aaron he couldn't throw a quick one at me so yes um, just what to do is there a uh a trick or a quick way or a mindset to be in when the internal and external say the, center and the circle don't immediately match up some of the methods we've talked about feel like they're taking a little too long to access in that moment yeah, okay again if we play the small things okay, and get the pattern down uh um they get faster okay with the warning don't try just for speed because it'll tend to be mental speed, but as you practice with smaller things if it's a medium thing boom, won't take so long if it's a big thing it won't take horrendously long because you've had some practice so that that's why i was enjoying that uh dialogue earlier tonight on do it in this summer so i'll be there in the winter or play games you know i mentioned dumb ones i had a game i played for quite a while uh, and i would stop before i walked up a flight of stairs i could have walked up the flight of stairs i'm not but the walker is the walker and the stair climber is a little bit different, although i had the ability as a walker to go up the stairs i would just use it as a practice game i pause and go okay stairs uh stair climber and i pause with the sense energies are mixing up a stair climber and then i'd go up the stairs and usually i could feel the extra bit through my feet the little extra springiness that was there and stuff a dumb little game i didn't have to do it i couldn't walk up the stairs but i would practice make up practices okay you drive your car all the time you don't have to really adjust to drive your car but i take oh and sit feel the seat position myself with the four tires start the car maybe a quick now i'm a driver maybe, i'll do that, knowing it's mixing a better driver who's more aware with faster responses bing, bang whatever so that's a could be part of the answer to your question, uh, a lot of the practices we do we take our time purposefully so you can see experience, how it works okay so not just knowing about it but the actual experience of how it works i like to take our time there but again later bang, okay i can turn on pretty fast now sensei was he could be so it can be fast but if i tell people that you'll have an idea about oh yeah magic, and then it's all it says there's no reality actual there's no actual there it's a beautiful idea there's no actual there so in a lot of our practices i'd like to especially take our time so that you have a sense of how it works actually experientially okay so that's a piece of it uh, i'm, i'm, i'm, floating around here add something to that if you want or fine-tune me yeah um no that i think that's really helpful i guess to add to it a follow-up question is um making sure that i am gathering the right nutrients right character to the situation okay, okay, it's not your business how about that okay see that's what slows us down what do i need let me think about this let's see i'm going out on a date i need to be handsomer and nicer and i got a discourse and i got to be polite and you mental people stop it you drive me crazy it's a law going on a date with that particular lady got to be careful i want to confuse you ladies easy and you trust the system of that word trust again it's a very intelligent and it knows more than bobby knows okay and as you just open and allow it it'll mix up the proper character for that particular lady if you date somebody else the next night no i won't go there if you date somebody else the next night uh, you clear again so the character you mix up is proper for that lady in aikido uh, uh bret can wait a second yeah oh yeah am i gonna screw this up okay and again now the system easy is mixing up a better interest recall okay easy it's mixing up okay now along the way you notice things and then you screw it up i noticed my foot knee were there very well before the rest of it was there okay, now we screw it up here oh i got it i see, put me put me i start to own it which kills the continuation easy it's mixing up better okay a fair good body form hell but there was a bit of a flow a bit of a bit of a flow a bit of smoothness what word yeah it smells deep smooth, that was smoother yeah oh i just learned something i'll do it smoothly and now you're starting to screw it up easy it's mixing up and it's continuing to mix up a little fuller i think oh that's it go fully you got to screw it up stop it continue, i trust it's mixing up the proper, character, for this situation okay it's not for me to have to learn that's important this is important now that's important how sort of sort of secondarily i learn that because it happens over and over again for example but i, don't use it to know how to do this technique easy, it's just a game and allowing what we're talking about i think that's good enough [Music] started on something i don't know how well it came across um oh trusting the mix okay so i just trusted in that situation that it would mix up the proper character for that situation okay now if we change it to a circular turn i take a moment and clear knowing it's going to be a different character and i just clear and it begins to, create, a character who likes to move circular and improves and improves and improves i don't know if i said anything i think i said something cool there i'm not sure help you said something cool sensei yeah um yeah um yeah so, it's thank god if we have to figure out exactly what i need and stuff oh yeah uh it's, beyond me uh you know uh you're expecting bobby to know what robert needs or bobby to know what not joe needs oh my god are you going to ask that little idiot anything about next to next what does he know not too much sometimes i just have to know if i easy and open it'll start to work out keep it simple right kiss oh my god where are we people where are we it's uh it's mike from new zealand sensei, i for me uh the three words that i've just written down as a result of what you were saying was trust the system that that's, now nice idea now, trust this actually what does that mean here, what does that mean nice words what does it mean what's the experience of opening and allowing the experience of it okay oh yes absolutely and just, one word oh no yeah no the words just serve as a that yeah quality they're not they're not something to um you know speaking in your head as a mantra not like you know always been coming at me a lot lately is um that's fine to have an idea or a desire or whatever but in doing that to immediately know it has a partner experiential partner, the stuff of it here's the idea of it it's fine i've got nothing to get your ideas, okay, what i get about is when you think that's everything now i get at you okay and i'll always be at you about that nice idea now, the actual experience could we call it of the stuff that's mixing and uh be careful because this one gets really cute and he'll be uh aware that there should be an experience which is not really the fullness of the experience okay you have to double check them triple check them oh yes i'm aware there should be an experience oh yes an experience i'm having an experience i'm having an experience i don't know you're still into awareness of it it's a distinct it's a partner but it's a distinct partner you don't confuse a she with he or he with she they're, distinct you don't confuse the soil in the pot with the plant although they have a hell of a relationship there uh you don't confuse them a certain way again am i saying that right yeah yes absolutely back to you mike where, where are you going here was that it was the only other thing that um with the topic of sustaining was that the, conversations that you and i used to have, which, about me being concerned about, me being concerned about wanting to sustain these elevated levels that we can achieve the whole time yeah now you may have noticed i don't ask you about that anymore because but nonetheless it was an interesting point for me was why would we ever want to come down from these better, better levels of consciousness and action and okay i'm sorry i gotta make my correction again come down from where the f did you go it's here it's here if you say come back to a heavier okay but come down from i want to get away from this it's up there because we're going to lose the whole sheerness of it okay enough come back just trying to get you to adjust your language here a bit well so you got an inner experiential state could we call it it's very nice okay uh but then there'll be some changes won't there if you have to change your tire you can still be calm or whatever nice as you change the tire but, you have to also though we have to be open to the energies necessary to change, the tire the tire to jack it up safely so, you don't lose your foot or whatever there's other things going on a teacher you want to jump in on, that one here i am there you are you want to uh read uh that uh that he was presenting uh, inner, finer something and uh retaining that uh mike you're free to correct me if i'm not saying it well yeah so the uh one of the things that i've really noticed in, my practice and also working with individuals is that when you look at states and that's in a sense i think what mike is pointing to is uh states that we sometimes get to um through our practices you know it's like a good flow state in randori or something like that using the aikido metaphor but there's other ways that people are in the zone you know in playing music and jazz or, you, name it there's different there are different things the sustainability of those states is um is um is not really part of nature in my uh in my experience in other words we have to take that, beautiful uh peak or the they're, called peak experiences for a good reason because they're, at that upper part of the, of the of the curve of the uh sine wave and sensei said something very interesting to me this week when we were we were talking about down time on the down part of those of those curves which uh are very much a part of our experience and i said well of course it has its partner with the uptime and he said well wait, you know what you get in the downtime what you get in that bottom part is the access to uh we were talking nutrients we were talking about the finer level uh that of appreciation of experience that, that potentially can take place there so i hope that is uh you know there's a lot of moving parts in what i just said but i hope that's useful well one well one thing uh mike that to uh say you experience a nice whatever we're gonna call it a nice state i think that uh that teases example of when you do round orion it just it feels magical you know it's just yeah, good example i want to say something like in for lack of words establishing that state as full as it can be experienced establish that state then when we move out into other things uh i think it's easier to come back there because it's been established to hit it at first you gotta spend a lot of time around you're not sure where you are and when it's only boom nice but as it gets established it's easier to get back to yeah and this i believe is what else sensei was doing which is what he called morning prayers a bad word because we were, western praying uh but he would establish, a certain level okay and then during the day uh he would have a reminder that, existed but he didn't necessarily walk around from that level but if anything happened he could get to that level and again he was fast and full so, he could get to that level it's not like he was always at that level, sensei if i could say another thing here as i've as i've taught um have the, privilege really of, teaching meditation retreats and doing uh somatic work with people on those retreats over the years um people will often say to me well you know how can i sustain this beautiful feeling that i've developed over you know five or six or seven days on a retreat and i have to say well you, know realistically you can't it's not really made for that you get you get the benefit and the insight, uh as a as a core experience and that you can tap on that but you can't make the rest of your life uh you know when you're going to work or driving down the freeway in the same way that you're that you get from a meditation retreat after you know five or six days or whatever yeah well said deja and, i do now fully appreciate that it also seems to me that you know i was going to use the word knee but i don't think the need the word need is the right word that do you need a purpose for, um, drawing in resources and nutrients to achieve that purpose yeah that's how that's how it seems to me in other words there's a particular activity or situation uh that you that you want to do your best in uh or allow yourself to experience the best um and at that point that's, when you can summon this or not summon open and allow open and allow, uh, yeah let's uh overlay this diagram here center circle with the potted plant theory so i'm a plant i'm a character bobby robert nado i'm a plant if the plant needs something it makes that statement i'm not functioning as well as i'd like to as a plant that signal message goes to the circle the pot with the soil the nutrients and the nutrients are all there by law and the plant intake pump the pump those nutrients and whatever it called out for they're in the nutrients did i say that well so overlay the center circle with the potted plant now you get the best of both worlds or something you see it clearer, okay, uh, what a beautiful creation once we catch that the possibilities there see i was presenting a healing possibility i'm just bouncing there again, that the plant says oh my god i'm not well inner, these, nutrients, are forming boom they're mixing inner healing to the outer is what i was trying to present with the healing pattern, uh so i could use the potted plant theory to present that, way am i getting too lost here not at all i think the, the feeling of that overlay center circle, center with uh the what we're talking about is the potted plant theory i think is a beautiful way of accessing the shall we say embodied being the embodied knowledge direct connection to experience there because, they are concepts in themselves but when you really settle in, the same way that you suggested to us and we were talking when you were mentioning to uh to mike to uh you know that's the concept now what's the experience and mike said yeah that's the yeah that is the that's the amusing language is uh is kind of a signifier or tag there tag there uh yeah you see everything we do i think i think i'm saying this right uh we present ideas we present, ideas we present images oh remember the potted plant is it gone the potted plant picture that was a nice picture uh i don't know if i have it anymore that was a nice picture uh, nice presentation but, you have to pump the pump you have to pump the pump you have to play with this with the sense of experiencing it okay all right the idea the image the presentation great but there's the next part of it the actual part of it okay that's the connecting with the with the nutrients, yeah and part and in essence the trust is uh i think as mike you said trust the system and i think that's trusting you know what i would say trusting the dow trusting, the universe in that way, you know um it has there is some order to it there it when you when you settle in um with the i think the word i would use mike was intention that's that kind of sets the, ground for your potential experience um in the in the area that you're looking at that you're that we're engaging with yeah oh yeah great to be see what i hope for week to week that during the week you've heard on the friday the layout presentation we might have done a moment standing, uh but my, hope is that during the week you actually played experience played with some of these things so it's not just the friday night layout that you took a couple of minutes at least during the week to play now there are certain subjects maybe not easy to play with or whatever but a lot of them have been the potted plant theory, finer soil finer soil i don't know if we clarified it that much but the finer soil and the plant up and down is using those nutrients uh and give you a physical example oh i'm standing straighter whoa oh i feel fuller oh i feel stronger that that's me the body character plant talking, okay not an idea an actual, now careful again some ideas you get a little partial taste and you think you did it you got it careful hit it again double check it actual, not your awareness oh yes i like the word actual and there you go again okay so i don't know how to say that better i'll just keep jumping on you that's all best i can do you may have noticed tonight we're using the word nutrients historically we use the word energy energies, energies are mixing and whatever and i thought, you know i wonder if nutrients might for some people or yeah be an easier word nutrients, i'm not sure energy what do energies mean, what are they going to do to me uh do uh what if i don't like them i thought the word nutrients was more benign is that the proper word benign, is that the proper word benign yeah uh i thought the word nutrients, nutrients, whatever it's in the nutrients beautiful creation whatever is necessary is available it's in the nutrients it's in the nutrients okay uh so i just thought maybe i'll change your work words uh might help some people if they don't if their sense of energy could be weird or interfering a bit i, know that for me when i first heard that, would you sense a long time ago i think you were trying to get us to get grounded and we're going through the process and i remember you scooping up from the earth and going and scooping up in the community and then to your body and i thought at the time where i experienced it was what a fascinating thing to do pick it up and give it to yourself um and this year the idea of the nutrients has always been a really refreshing, kind of calming for me so you like nutrients in some cases better than energy i do differently okay good i risk my case uh i'm just liking that little switch over from energies to nutrients and that's why by the way uh settling deeper, roots, that's a very critical word roots okay, all right all right so since they mention it but didn't mention it a lot i don't want to get into that though do i it since it was dialoguing with me and he say japanese culture the underworld stuff that we're calling nutrients, uh it's not look japanese have a bad sense of it it's death it's destruction it's pestilence it's all these horrible things we in the west have ours that's hell okay, uh that he sort of purposely didn't push on it because they were coming out of world war ii war ii occupation uh anything of suffering and, dying uh they already had done that he'd be repeating world war ii phrases i didn't want to scare them away so he didn't push on his as much as he sort of wanted to because they, weren't ready, it was like his presentation and that culture weren't quite clicked it just it just i almost call that bad timing or not quite, the right lineup or something uh anyway roots now you have an idea of roots oh yeah i know i read a book about roots i can tell you about roots nice great, now the actual experience of roots i've got a fair amount of idea here so yes but i may have a little tiny percentage of experience oh i'm starting to actually feel a little tingling coming up my, feet okay but i'm still a lot of awareness about it but some roots sucking up nourishment there kind of thing okay uh hit it again the experience of roots, huh the roots themselves seem to suck it up oh and, by the way i never had that feeling before but maybe that's where the word slurpee came from huh that the roots themselves seem to slurp me up the nutrients through the system character me ah anyway, i, got lost i like the word nutrients uh, completely so if i say nutrients it means what you consider energies i just thought the word was easier to work with fit in well with the potted plant example, um i think you're right sensei nutrients i can't take the word nutrients in anything other than a positive way whereas energy can be there's a spectrum you know it can be really good or it can be really bad yeah, yeah, so yeah it sounds like a maybe a maybe a an easier term to, introduce people to yeah and the other thing i just wanted to add was another was sorry this business of trust um which is absolutely vital but my op my sense is that you can't get to a good place of trusting until you are well centered an uncentered person won't be able to trust my sense and let's say it this way if i say the same thing but just using a different throw in a different word there, easy the eye finer level of self begins to naturally trust tight eye bobby has no trust not so tight but still tight robert not that trusting but as, that easy the eye easy the eye clearer of self then, the trust is sort of but naturally there yeah, yeah anyway yes thank you mike people were any anything that'll keep you awake tonight if we don't get into it for a moment and the last call for someone to speak up, or not i didn't say yes sir um, going back to sustainability um, sustaining, in, my sort of experience if i haven't truly gone to a final level uh it's getting close it's quite a good place but that doesn't sustain that, will dissipate kind of over time it'll just disappear but if i've truly, truly gone to a new level that will be there for me in the future it'll be just year for me yeah, uh, oh okay good real quick uh direct diagram the idea of, a state a state can't sustain very well uh it can get knocked off okay pretty easy that was one game i used to play i, consider myself a balloon popper somebody had i an idea and they were like saying that's me i would in some form pop their balloon, okay, i thought it was healthy for them i enjoyed this the idea alone has trouble sustaining when you start to get its partner the experience the body of it if you would the stuff of it the nutrients mixing up the plant the plant now you can start to get sustainability because there's some body there so to speak enemy body, body some body there and that's harder to push over or, bounce out you see i just have an idea i can yeah pop it pretty easy but if they're boom being it uh we used to say water off a duck's back that no matter what i say, they're clear that oh actually yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yep and, then later when you want to get back to it you because you've established this and that of it yeah, enter the circle of it or, whatever it's easier to get back to boom you can inhabit it real fast because you've been there before it's like waiting for you yeah, and i guess some support yeah, and, again i guess sometimes when you're, kind of kind of approaching a new level you can get confused and thinking that is it rather than it sort of like a switch over into that new level uh here i'm not sure if we're quite worrying about the awareness of it comes in first oh yeah, you're aware of it yeah, and now to continue the experience of it go deeper with it and get into dirty soil, that's scary under there there's worms crawling around it bugs oh my god look at it look at it it's a cow manure or whatever they call it near part of the woods there exactly, yeah, yeah and you go through it and lo and behold it's more than fertilizer nutrients, beautiful nutrients whatever they'll mix it up mix you up plant so yes uh always were aware first that's fine now the next stage is experience what you're aware of yeah and double check it because the awareness part is smart and, it might get close and feel some vapors and say yeah i'm experiencing it yeah but it might just be the vapors yeah, yeah i see the steam from the hot tub hey, i just took a bath no you see the steam that tells you you're getting close now what's the next stage step into the damn hot bath and soak in the damn hot bath the heat is internal and it's boom it's actually there but to see it yeah you can understand a lot about it you get a little closer yeah you feel the, warmth or the steam oh i'm, experiencing not yet people not yet not yet people not yet i don't know how else to present that out how nicer to be about that but it's a missing link historically forever why i don't know we have to get back to the beginning of creation but uh it's still with us okay let's do it with us yeah thank you mark and nicole thank you people, finney, i think so sensei uh it's one second though uh i, don't have time to talk to him but is uh, a slater dave you're on david flater uh i'm sorry sensei he's not on tonight okay, all right all right another time um yes thank you people thank you thank you very much sensei and thank you thank you very much sensei and thank you everyone thank you thank you sensai thank you thank you thank you sensei thank you sensei bye everyone danny can you stand around stay around for just a minute yeah well i just know that a couple people wanted to talk to you so uh hello why am i on danny it's good to see you i'll tell you that oh there you are man are you looking good there that's a great photo man he has a his dog has a very handsome guy next to him he asks is that a butterfly behind you in the painting no, no it's not it's just an abstract thing, no it's not it continues all the way around what you're seeing it could be a butterfly danny uh tj here oh hey kitchen hi man uh i just wanted to say it's great to great to see you and really have a lot of appreciation for the contributions that you're making just by being who you are uh here on uh on uh nado's uh evenings here so yeah thanks anyway i, know that you know that we uh we're sending you a lot of love and, i certainly do and yeah that she for sure yeah, it's um it's um yeah of course so many people think that their regards in such different ways, yeah and, i understood whether people wanted to pray or just sing, their regards and that i could feel it the same yeah you know i just thought oh you know this kind of, praying oh i'm a praying man or, i'm a meditating man it's such and really you know goodness, is where it's at really yeah so yeah thank you thank you thank you so good i'm going to sign off but i appreciate uh lauren you uh holding that holding the thing open here for a couple minutes all right all right take care brother i'll talk i'll see you soon see you soon bye tj i'd say yes i'd just like to say it's just great seeing your face danny and hearing a voice that uh from some of the previous conversations that i've had with you is just a different person and it's a wonderful um thank you thank you and how far are the two of you physically separated where are you physically, uh we're 40 or 40 or 50 kilometers apart i always like it when you have to plug into a zoom session with the rest of us are in california in order to hey kids looking on each other just down the road from each other what's that well, no they were they were playing safe okay in terms of having lots of people coming around my we cannot hear you kenny i see he'd love to talk to you but his microphone's not working right okay all right all right thank you everyone moon anything before we close out moon shooting the moon mooning people he's on a lunar calendar yeah well anyway guys keep doing what you're doing yeah i've got a long way to go yet i realized that and you know bob said something tonight about you've got to keep, going don't i can't remember exactly what it was but something about keeping on going just rang a bell for me and yeah i'm not yeah i've got a ways to go and i'm gonna stay and keep my attention on [Music], what, around, what i'm thinking watch over watch over and moon i see your mic is open again any final words no i was just going to say you know i'm, looking at you dang i'm thinking you know, uh, i, can't i can't quite get it back you know when i first met you i don't know if you can even think back that far but you know you were kind of coming out of your street fighter phase you know what i mean yeah and i'm thinking i'm thinking i'm thinking you know you just you're looking good you just look like you're, you know just it's just amazing so i'm really happy to see you i just can't tell you and uh keep up the fight bro yeah, for

we'll be in touch danny right thanks so much mike, yeah you

and before we start is there anything else carried over from another from a different friday before we start on our subject tonight questions problems observations is there anything else okay bob i just want to remind you in our phone conversation about since it seems like it probably will fit into the topic but, about, um, i had, this uh issue with bobby, robert nadeau yeah and, you had suggested that we don't need to, imitate your style your delineation uh so uh so you know you suggested for me a level of batter in baseball or something else but yeah, it's easy to get that confused yeah i, don't i'm sorry i don't understand that but uh but uh, yeah when i say bobby robert i don't expect you to be a robber it's just to show you an upgrade so what i did with him apparently on the phone was a level of batter and an easier settle you open mixes up a better level of batter whatever you want to call what do you want to call those levels of matter so that's all i'm trying to get across so uh you know yeah change the words to suit you let's leave that on open a bit as long as they fit into the proper context of things anyway thank you steve okay anybody anything all right uh, we're not going to do much with that diagram but we can use him i guess uh, so the uh so the uh the two parts the, uh that are going on here and now uh, we've covered i think quite a lot we just talked about it a moment ago uh, the development of the character bobby roberto one by two by three bye huh uh, fair day good day great day uh so it just or examples of what words you could maybe use or your picture of it and then your experience of it uh so that uh developing your person character the i don't call it the functioning unit boom, boom okay, uh so what anything to go over there maybe we could use the word lineage maybe, let's say the, lineage i want to start with is the person the character okay and not to uh bring in the i self and who am i really, right now let's, let's be distinct on, which is which and then hopefully uh, we'll get into the overlay of the two let's see both are here here's the person here's the character and the self is here now the eye in, starting it's kind of small, and, hard to pick up because he's there but he's kind of small what's an eye i'm bobby is that an eye okay, so, where are we going uh so right here right now if we're on the lineage of a better person, [Applause], and i use sports as an example the battery is just an example of using sports, uh it doesn't have to be sports it could be i'd like to be a better daddy if i had kids okay or a better dog trainer i want to get along better with the dogs if i had dogs whatever okay and so our basics on that easy and starting from wherever you start okay, [Applause], feel yourself and your viewpoint for a moment be honest with yourself okay started off properly present okay uh so if you're starting uh characters a little don't try i don't want to be not, yet easy i'm a little easy subtle, means settling opening inferring a better level or dimension okay, and in that better level on lineage the energies of that next better level mix up a better character okay, so if you're on a, batter's lineage, there's a fair batter as you settle and open it makes up a batter who's a little bit better boom maybe, and if he's feeling himself as batter he'll say oh my, feet contact is better oh my, my, feet contact is better oh my, hip seems to be turning more as i strike should pick up something okay so the development of the person we've covered that quite a lot okay the dimensionality form, with the energies at those finer next levels mixing up a better whatever lineage you're on okay better salesman a better daddy a better dog trainer a better, dog trainer a better batter uh whatever okay i think we've got that one kind of down pat don't we did i miss anything sensei this is uh tj i just wanted to review something there with you yeah um so character as you're talking about it is uh developed along a lineage and that we've kind of we've explored that in some depth over time i hope so yeah, me too the um what i want to appreciate here uh that we kind of just went through is that is that you start when you started you were you were actually doing the process of settling so you didn't say easy the eye this time but that's what you were doing you were you were kind of settling in and that allows the potential of the development of a of a more full character a fuller character, a fuller character yeah in whatever lineage it is yeah so let me jump in for a moment please uh so i'd have to say easy the eye just because again tonight i want to keep the eye self separate yeah i want to uh make sure they're both sort of clear as two distinct things before we say how they work together if we do that too fast i call it a smudge, people are confused or they're trying to bring in one when it's the other one trying to mix itself up and bring in the other one and a little confusion or smudging, so i'm anti-smudging tonight okay so instead of saying easy the eye i settle and i'm probably saying to myself easy, easy which means settle open and what happens for me when i settle open, ah it's a sense of a little more space the next dimension yeah and in that next space next dimension it'll mix up whatever lineage i'm on better, level of it yeah, and that's good and the one thing that i want to appreciate that kind of harkens back to a couple weeks ago when we're doing slow down at the border so this is a as you're as you're settling we're moving through a border so to speak there is a border or divider but you get very i ask them to slow down to really flavor how it works in case they ever bumped into any problems later they would recognize oh that's, just the border stuff no big deal yeah, so as you started today i was just watching you do all of those things that we've been talking about you were settling and you were really taking a time you weren't taking your time you weren't rushing into the place where you were settling for so i just wanted to make that note because these, this process that we're doing the development process of the character um it has all these beautiful components that were that we're practicing that we that were that we're practicing that we can practice in any uh in any part of life and on in aikido on the mat but certainly you know in all the, the lineages that you were talking about whether that's aikidoist or father or brother or sister or mom or anything remember the really dumb one i'd stop at the bottom of a flight of stairs yeah because i'd been a walker now i'm a stair climber coming up soon, yeah, okay, take a moment easy because the system wants to make some changes from walker to stair climber some little games we can play during the day for fun and practice yeah that's good so just acknowledging that yeah thank you very much that's great thank you okay yeah i don't want to be although these things can get very fast i'm leery that it'll become a fast idea oh yes i understand a finer dimension yes i'm there, uh and it's just an idea an idea an idea and it's going to screw up after a bit so, to feel to be more present to experience that next dimension we're in case of characters it's mixing up a better, more alive more alive character robert feels more alive than bobby, tends to be a little meh robert starts to wake up a bit nado is hey, almost, here i am what's up kind of thing uh so the aliveness factor uh is a uh as we go dimensionally can increase let's say you bump into a very good great athlete ah i'm sure i'm sure that their aliveness hum can i use that word here i tried that their aliveness hum is noticeable, and even if you didn't know who he was you'd say who is that guy because there's this alive hum make up your own word but alive and you know he's not the norm he's, he's more alive okay then you find out he's the great whatever the great boxer the great whatever, oh okay and two oh let's see i'm gonna follow the flow here, [Applause] okay let's stay with that word so uh so i'm going to use the word alive with the character the developing person on lineage alive okay, and i would like you to if you're playing with that kind of feel that word because when we shift over to self it has its own i don't say aliveness okay it has its own juice and we use we will use i'll bring it up tonight later a different word to represent that uh so i would like you to get a little bit clear on the words that you're using uh and you use your words i use a live for the character more alive more vibrant, i might say uh but it's clear to me i'm talking about character okay or i'm humming a bit again for me that'd be a character uh word okay so but you be clear on the word or words that you use for the ever if we're going dimensional those are dimensional things the ever finer dimension its vibration rate is different therefore it mixes up a character who's vibing at a different rate could we say you recognize your own word okay are we okay so far with that questions problem good, uh okay so i don't know if there's anything much we have to say about the development of the character is there haven't we covered that so well through the through the years whether it's been a couple of years on, friday nights here or in the dojo or whatever this is kind of an old basic are we okay with that old basic of character development a better level of person you and then whatever lineage you're on okay, yeah we're okay with that okay uh now let's see i can't use that one because i want to erase that guys i'm going to use the whiteboard here but still paper one more come on cooper okay, so in the same space okay, say that space is this space where this uh this person here now robert nado at least nado exists okay now let's erase so we'll keep this blank let's erase our caring for caring for are utilizing the person as a reference oh i, feel a little tighter here or a little looser there or that's fibery let's not let's, clear from that because we're going to go into an easy the eye easy soon there'll be an i self okay, and that'll continue a dimensional pattern, okay you know i like the, example of paper, to represent script my drawing here that the paper represents the self and at this level of at this level of nado or robert whatever level you're at there is paper self is there but because this character and the world he's in all the stuff that's going on around him uh it's like he's hard pressed to get a clear sense of self okay so what i want to do is ignore the drawing and deal with that easy the eye self with that sense of it's just a clear paper there it's not a nothing it's, aware of itself [Applause], it's involved with itself but not the busyness of the eye mind of the person easy, easy so anyway for me i, like the paper with a drawing on it the drawing is the character and everything that's going on for him the paper is the self okay i don't know if that came across well it's a beautiful picture in my in my world i don't know if it comes across okay, sensei this is lauren sometimes you've described that as the self as a is a pane of glass a piece of glass yeah i, would use the piece of glass that you so nicely gave me except i don't know how to erase the, coloring from it right off sensei yeah they'll, come right off paper and the piece of glass yeah same, thing just about a, different presentation might touch people a bit different same, same okay sense yeah okay so, where the hell are we they are in a relationship but i don't know if we want to get into that right now okay they are in relationship in the sense that as the character gets better this uh and because he's uh easy settled open and the character gets better because of that easy settle open this the self sort of the eye cell sort of tracks along with it if the character has interest now if the character doesn't have any sense, of the inner self uh it may not be clear to him am i screwing up these words i hope not uh it'll be clear to him that it's there okay, i forgot where i was going with this if somebody comes to me i'm going to try to salvage my conversation here if somebody comes to me and says sensei i want to improve my golf game can you help me help me i doubt very much if i'll bring up self to them to them they want to improve their golf game so i say okay stand there let me see how you stand there it's like oh you're not very grounded man i'm working the character person i may introduce them into settling a bit and, feeling a little bit different how do you feel my hips are starting to wiggle a bit okay good, okay so i'm going to dialogue them as to what they came to me with okay so far somebody else comes to me and says ah sensei i heard you have some insight in things i'm a great golfer but i'm kind of bored with it i'm wondering why the hell i'm even bothering i've saved enough money i'm bored with the acclaim and uh but something, something is missing, they're not asking me about golf they're, not asking me about golf they're asking me about self oh now i change my look at them or my dialogue with them about oh ease of the eye self, self is bitching self is pushing self wants to be acknowledged because it's there doesn't mean that people are acknowledging it kind of thing okay, i don't know if i said anything right with that little go around help me here don't let me get too lost well a sunset can be beautiful but if you don't connect your attention with it what difference does it make is that moon i'm just peeking in i gotta start in a second but i had to sneak in and hear this i was very interested in this rap okay i'm sorry i was so confused because i thought you were out on a gig could you say that again for me i am and i was just about to start but i was so interested in this particular rap before they, let us on stage that i wanted to catch how much i could and that this is exactly what i wanted to hear i said something i was right oh thank god, thank you richard well that this, whole, yeah, absolutely okay, yeah uh okay so we've got a person here, and now oh sensei don't go anywhere here enough person wants to develop better in a physical sense or a functioning sense, and not just golfing better daddy better doctor better in that same space in that same dimensional movement and very important that you have this under settling ever, increasing depth of things because there's this damn major of being aware of and one day we just talk about that that's an old, from the virtually from the beginning they over-awared and, lacked, the actual experience and it continues to this day okay so here and now with the sense of settling and when you move through dimensions that you're also moving deeper through dimensions okay not just an upper form where you can move through dimensions but you miss the fullness of experience you get some but not the fullness and you're throwing the balance of you of creation off because you're, overdoing one side and the other side is lacking it hasn't been allowed to be in harmony upper to the under and under to the whatever moment of being okay there are two forces of creation they want to work in a chord okay so we can get partials by doing partial but that'll screw you up in the long run okay, so this so this settling, sense experiencing okay it's very important am i diverging too much anybody where are we did you get lost along the way i wanted to make a comment or to get some clarification here yeah we're talking about developing character and lineage person um, we subtle and open okay and okay and our, sense of feeling of character um, relates, maybe to a an available level of functioning character depending on the situation that the character is lining up to or positioning with, if for example we're gonna climb the stairs uh, i, as i'm settling into a sense of character will sense feel that i can i'm available for five or ten stairs but 500, probably not the capacity to access at that level the energies or situation at hand is the situation is five not 500 and, no, problem no enjoy the five because the process is going to be pretty much the same for the 500 but it'll take you a bit longer at first, to get the mix for a character that can do 500 steps but you're practicing basics when you do a proper five step or ten steps okay, that's very important these first level one level two level three these first dimensional things are very important uh to get established good i don't know what they call it in school or good study habits good study habits in high school because you're damn well going to need them in college, yeah, you set it up right you don't get sloppy on your first set because you'll carry that into your second set your second set will be kind of sloppy now very important to approach it i know some of my advanced people probably get bored with me when i started class off on very simple things with this thing i already know that i don't have to do that but they don't realize how important no feel this really set this up and then we'll move into level two yeah and i don't care if, you've seen level two for the last 10 years do it do it damn it because we need that set so, uh you aware people will often tend to do that oh i, know i know what he's talking about no do it feel yourself at level one because in feeding yourself at level one it'll facilitate level two feeling itself and it will facilitate level three feeling itself for example okay, yeah am i diverging too much anyway uh so as we uh where are we going to get okay so let's just i think we're good enough on the character for now we'll bring them back later uh, on the converging what we're using not converging the overlay, sensing overlay uh form of things okay so, apparently we don't need to go over anything on developing a better level of character okay, you all got that one right okay, so now so now sitting here, and now in this space there is some paper i easy because it's potentially kind of small, easy, easy what does easy mean settle, open we're moving into a little bit larger space easy okay, remember my emphasis on the deeper sense feeling of things we want to continue with that it's not oh easy the eye and i range around the upper levels and i'm raging and it's free oh i feel so free i'm a kite i'm a balloon oh i'm free, yes you can do that and one day we'll go over that style of meditation and stuff not tonight here, here okay oh since i told you he said don't go anywhere don't, go into that as a major here major dimensionally here, here, here, here can bring us through finer and finer and finer, of both easy the eye and the character okay when you do them both here that way it will facilitate the uh overlay proper overlay, okay and we'll get into that after a bit okay, [Music], so i guess we have to do a little easy, the eye easy now if you still have a chattering mind about what we're being easy about what are we looking for easy, easy let all that go easy that's related to the drawings let the drawings go as the eye eases there's a settling opening of i nest [Music] sense of empty here and my flavor don't panic it's okay easy [Music], the high self kind of elusive at first easy it's okay you get any sense of a little more spaciousness a little more room a little i don't know area is that the right word area now in the subtle easy open in that more room it might the energies of mixing up a character, might be there for you i'm not interested i'm not interested in any drawings right now i want to stick with the paper the canvas the piece of glass the eye i moves along into an eye self easy starting to notice uh like a calmness flavor oh is the ice self calm yeah there's calmness easy i'm going to stick with the glass that's moving through columnist to glass becoming more aware of its self its bigger self as glass or canvas or clear paper hey i don't know right up to that point your, sense of the area is a little more spaciousness do we have to know can't hurt what's your sense of sense of that you're that you are in fact easing the eye heading into an eye cell all right comfortable no chatter no chatter okay no chatter okay somebody no chatter i agree no chatter unwound clearer it's the first part first word uh unwound, not wound up but unwinding okay, okay it feels like i've unwound okay for me i'm back to the familiar again familiar place at this space for like a workspace feels familiar senses from familiar is that what you meant right yes, yes, yeah yes oh let's see we're going to continue a bit along the way noah say something about this, and where it's heading for there's you inner, glow here that's not the product of the forces that makes the character okay he's a bit ahead of us here and he's already picking up the aliveness, i'm not going to use that word because i use it for the character but the aliveness of the self itself we're going to use the word glow as, a useful word that we can use uh we'll be free to change it but a glow seems to be a nice uh a sense of it for a bit okay uh so a little bit ahead of us i just was still myself into that just, letting go and getting a sense of more room, airiness freedom easy making sure i'm letting go of any drawings that may be jumping in and trying to draw not interested in that right now you can see easy tja you've run into a million people doing this where are we here where are we going with it yeah there is uh you start to feel a natural alignment for me are you using the body with that word feel i most certainly am using the word uh using the body with that okay could we not, could we not unless you're using it for a quick reference okay i know i know i mean let me check the body oh the body is i want to stay away from the drawings if i can right now okay that's where i'm that's where i'm starting i'm starting with that sense of alignment that is relaxed it's, naturally aligned and in that there is um, there is there is spaciousness there's an effortless uh effortlessness about it for me it's effortless you know effortless being i'm not having to do anything with the structure but i start with the alignment and start with the feeling of bad alignment yes okay, uh could i say you could start with the alignment before you start with now i'm ready, easy the eye easy the eye so that i don't have to as i'm eating the eye be checking out the body we're back to drawings again i want to stay away from the drawings here to clarify easy the eyes self, because i think we smudge them and i don't want i want to stay away totally from anything that might smudge them that's why i'm yammering here okay then, effortless presence after that is established there's an effortlessness uh about that okay, okay after that's established so yes again in the beginning of your sitting establish that as part of your beginning setup where you've got that ah you're comfortable on the pillow so to speak you're, made all your little adjustments yeah now, now inner finer easy the eye who the hell am i let me start that okay so, i think he and i clarified that yeah, yeah we clarified that are you clear i am clear those other people i'm not looking at other faces here are they okay yeah you see tonight i, wanted to major in, with this fear that there's a lot of smudging going on in the world i wanted to present i wanted to separate out the two so that there'd be less smudging oh okay so that's why i'm yammering because you want to separate out so easy to the eye self airiness the center more room i like what you said uh at the end Teja the what'd you call that effortlessness effortless presence yeah effortless i self-present it's an effortless presence there's a nice flavor to that it seems like okay yeah after a bit as we move along see we're moving dimensionally here easy, the eye moving on dimensionally i change a little but i say i self easy myself as i move along i may just say self, self okay self okay there'll be a certain point here am i jumping the gun a certain point where the self itself will uh i see noah's ahead of us said oh it's glowing it's making itself known, could we say let's see let's see in essence of saying i'm here i glow is that all right bob did i worded it that way yeah he gave me the thumbs up it's okay yeah, okay, i wanted to ask something if you don't mind, this is elaine yeah gotcha it seems i may be jumping ahead also probably, damn you advanced people so you know you can tell me to shut up and wait if you need to but it seems it seems there is a switch that happens in this beginning of you know you make a decision to be, to be present um easy the eye and, there are these how do i say this at a certain point when the aliveness and the vibrance really starts to be apparent, it seems that, what's happening is not so much it's a process we started but then the self takes over and it's not so much that you're making any decisions about what's going to happen or anything you're just being with what the self has to offer is that okay returning back it seems like it flips yeah sorry go ahead well i think didn't you start at the beginning where you first started to sit and there's a lot of energies moving around mm-hmm, okay, at the same place that i think tj was lining things up here they're starting there and you're saying okay much energy yeah okay they're just energies i'm not interested in that right now fine, now easy the eye and we're heading for paper to continue being paper clear glass to be a bigger piece of clear glass right here so is that what you mean by the glitch it's not really i don't feel it as a glitch i feel it you brought the word up gift maybe more a shift in um how we're present with it that in initially we're making a decision to, settle and open and um, [Music], and we're making a decision to either meditate or be a ball player which, one are you going to use which one are you on right, yeah, right now we're on the easy the eye one okay now where are we so it so it yeah and, i guess i'm what i'm asking is a little early then maybe, i, i kind of felt that i switched from lining up and sort of getting ready or whatever we do to open up to this to, letting it dictate letting, self speak letting self be more and it's not my it's no longer me saying i think we're still talking about the pre-prep, of sitting to meditate sounds to me what you're saying that there's some pre-prep uh, uh he just said he likes to line up here you say uh first you're aware of energies and stuff sure of course now in there i'm shifting to the paper easy the eye self but i need some minutes and if i were really pissed off at the boss all day i'd need a couple extra minutes because i'm really mad, and it takes me a little bit longer to get here ah to begin to feel and make sure i'm sort of here lined up comfortable on the pillow and then someplace there i start with easy the i form or what i call meditation yeah are we okay, cool hey anybody i don't want to lose anybody here, we okay so far sensei uh i am bless eugene i am wondering how it maps into your description of paper or glass for me uh this relaxation feels like uh the kind of fresh air almost like after the rain air and kind of my point from which observation happens almost moves all the way back to the point that i am kind of in front of this there is kind of independent observation and it happens in the level independent, independent observation observed my, point from which i am observing what's happened what happens is all the way in the back to the point that my body is somewhere in front of it is it the paper possibly yes possibly your position of self is way back and that's what you're talking about if that's so we will try to get yourself to a line and underlie the body because way back is not quite what we want for a lot of things so if it in fact is way back uh and hopefully as you begin to ah i don't know the word now for self uh, i don't say sense feel because feeling is of kind of a human physical word but it's sensing itself it's aware of itself and it's sensing itself got nothing to do with do with physical right now we're on paper we're on glass okay if yourself is back uh it will as you more have a sense of, what i'm saying that a sense experience it it's experiencing itself got nothing to do with body stuff uh that it will naturally position in better, all right okay uh so far we've had a couple of people uh contact me and say in playing with the alignment of self to their person i had a couple of oh i was off to the side so they're making a correction because they'll function better when it's positioned in the here and now underlying, their person should be much better much healthier okay is that okay so far and that's, the work me and susan have been playing with, uh ill people kind of screwed up in different ways uh come into her office and we're double checking their self-position with their body because if the self is way out of alignment the body is being affected okay, so uh so uh somebody uh this is a great one somebody, uh this is a great one somebody who mentioned to me their self was off to the side said oh and then i realized that me the person i tend to do things from the side i thought oh beautiful itself off to the side the person goes off to the side where was i going with that uh oh that in getting their selves to be more present because the self has a lot of glow a lot of life energy different than the body energies okay but it underlies those and enhances those so when the self is present we potentially get a lot of healing potential there okay so if danny's on danny okay, uh, gina's on gina big down dark time you like that big down dark where does that bring you to a much finer level okay and, at that level you'll touch something, that you know you've gone as far as you can go kind of thing as it suddenly dawns again the night dark time is over and it dawns again okay for you i would suggest that in that dawning is self, is there sense of self okay, and because self has this uh a noah glow this radiation self is there and self position here and now that radiation can radiate out and take care of physical things we're getting some good results me and susie okay, we're seeing this thing works okay, so that's my suggestion of using the dark better level of self but, make sure the position so better level of self glows radiates and that radiation will naturally affect, okay, i might suggest don't you leave the glow to see how things are going trust the pattern it's glowing okay if you want to add better vision or something fine just say the word but don't leave the glow and come out to that, don't leave this inner finer to check the person's out is what i'm trying to say i can't say things in a nice way but gina knows me so okay thank you where the hell are we people where are we, okay, self-self so let's make a uh because we're eating up time uh let's, easy, you're on track ease of the eye to itself, okay uh let's not do baby steps anymore the best you can easy go back to go back to our last place there easy the eye self easy okay now there is a finer level of self is here i'm sort of skipping through moving through uh a few dimensions let's say when i do this it's my down time down to a finer level and it's opening again finer level of self i don't know what words to use my sense feeling, was there was some bright uh, i don't know there's something here bright i, could really feel it i don't mean physical sense easy, better level of self boom and a better level of self easy, okay easy okay easy do the best you can have a sense presence feeling might be a tendency to come out and turn and look it's hard to see the finer and finer whatever things they were over here looking, sense, since, experiencing self is experiencing itself okay all right okay we got the game one more time on that and i'll try to shut up easier the eye and the, finer the more original the bigger piece of the paper of self is here moving into downtime here into the bigger piece of paper that's here self a finer level of self a truer self easy since experience self is experiencing itself we did a class six months a year ago on, over self talking to it i don't like the word over self anymore uh because i want to really position it better, uh and talking to it it's like instead of talking to it it's experiencing for lack of words itself finer level of self is experiencing itself we finished a quick check without losing this on its position with that physical body person character you what i'm trying to get you to is a sense of the here and now of it that it is bigger than the person's body but it's right here i don't know if you have a glow yet but maybe, maybe for some of you some sense of an emanation let's say what's your sense here is a better level of self experiencing for lack of words itself, like the words it's alive with itself not to confuse it with the aliveness of a better baseball player this is self's aliveness so maybe i shouldn't use that word this is self's is self's glow but maybe you don't quite sense it as a glow maybe you have a different sense of self-emanation alright ah okay, ah, [Music] felt like not a bad touch let's get the feedback easy my, unwinding became clear and clear and clear my sense of clear became a very faint at first but radiating a radiant core faintly radiating from a core my sense of body disappeared completely that was clear and a core radiating again, faint at first but yeah i, imagine sitting with it for a while it would become more and more powerful or potent or obvious yes yeah, of course yeah, almost not expected to without doing a number on it, that's the law you had the bobby then you had the bobby then you had the robert then you had not go the law hasn't changed you had a blue belt and you had a brown bun you had a black belt the law hasn't changed, it's not going to get worse maybe things that happen to go what the hell is that or something but it's, still on, that same routine of more original the purity perfection of more original it's still heading that way if we don't bend and contort and whatever that's where it's heading that's where it's always been heading okay, once we unwind a bit yeah, somebody, that this is nancy i train with bob noah um i i'm getting a sense of pervasive benevolence a sense of generosity benevolence like pervading all yeah like a generosity that's available from some place yes in tracking back experiencing back the, the uh the uh i self and finer more original self the might be getting into a different topic here but the qualities of self might begin to show along the way so that might be one that one of the at least at least well one of the main qualities i play the game of four for you there are four main ones or archetypes four and then uh, we, let we, let uh whatever percentage of each one be present okay all right so yeah i like the flavor there um, as you continue be naturally open to whatever more or next wants to show they sometimes take turns in the way that they show even though they're all there they make like take turns okay uh almost a different topic but yeah i like the flavor somebody you're a little more advanced self a bigger piece of paper bigger piece of glass uh i change the words self find yourself finding yourself truer self, find your own words i'm just making sure i'm, helping myself move along okay ease of the eye high self easy, after bit of finer self easy whatever word you want to use what's finer than the finer self original self a more original self a more original self okay the original self is too big a gel more original self uh let's see how i use the words i don't expect you to use those words but get how i use them and use your words in a similar fashion they're moving along words don't disservice yourself oh no not me and don't jump oh self i'm an original god i'm god uh, you know don't go that way but do move along move along move along for lack of work uh bob i do did i check with you on this better level of self what, what you get to the globe becomes more and more full and fine as self experiences itself more deeply yeah should be so where the uh again the finer of glow is glowing uh yeah the size of it is, growing and it's self-generated by itself yes, yes it's not it's not yeah, see, in the as a character you're generated by the energy beats there center circle, center or up and down, and up whatever form you're, playing with uh and that helps generate the aliveness of a person the self has more access to its own what should we say there bob it's on resources of itself yes it, produces its own nutrients if we can use that word here okay use nutrients a lot in the potted plant form, right and we're using it in terms of the plant the person the character i don't want to use that sort of right here now it might, smudge it might smudge right, but it's, self-supplying or, or it seems to be able to pump its own increase or something yeah okay but that's just used words that we used in the in the uh tighter spiral of the heavier manifest here and see that there's a smudging potential and i don't want to go there with that it's self-feeding yeah you mentioned you use the word emanation at some point and it, just seems that, fits with this also it emanates it yeah it yeah okay close it so that's not it emanates it uh radiates it yeah right in any comfortable sense that you have and, that's really different from a two-beat or any of the other things yeah talk about on the other levels i also noticed in some earlier stages of this that i was feeling porous and then i realized even the porous but i realized that even that description is still related to physicality so i dropped that also and just kept um, just stayed with this you know the self overlay just kept letting go of the physicality and letting, go into the self and letting that aliveness and i got to that quality of, there's, um it has its own the words are all wrong it has its own emanation its own um yeah it's not a voice but it's its yeah it's pretty, good at doing that uh when with the work i'm doing with susan when we asked the self to be present better in position underlying their person uh we realize themselves aren't aware of their aliveness enough okay at the level they're at and so if we see that we ask themselves to, i don't know uh susan can you hear me uh do a little pump to increase their aliveness presence to help facilitate healing and stuff and maybe by pumping a little bit where the person will go whoa there is something within me they'll feel that glow that, something, and it'll be easier for them to say oh yes, inside me is something whatever however they, term it don't be they'll like feel it or feel the radiation of it or have a better inner sense of something yeah, so one day you'll be able to say to those people inner self and i'll go oh yes, they already kind of know what you're talking about because they've experienced it something like that okay uh, running out of time here soon the overlay again i think i've laid it out but uh many levels of self let's say okay so we're finding uh a lot of cells uh, who are out of position with their person, uh we probably have a lot of overs they're probably more full verse lookers and therefore their person is probably, a thinker a certain way i've had a couple of people talk about off to the side i've told you a couple of cases i experienced in my development uh where herself was way to hell back there didn't want to get involved with this kid who's dying didn't want any part of them, i tried to say hey once you come in we can maybe cure the kid he said hell no i ain't going uh again my sense was at this time of asking him to take re repossession of his totally wrecked car and he said no man i ain't going there uh so there so to get them to position better to get them to come more alive especially in uh not just healing but as an example to get some healing effect okay, all right uh there's some great potential there there's some great potential there um in, the presence of self the character can square away better be affected by that presence and square away better not just get healthier but end up in the right career for them or, something it should it should facilitate, an improvement of the person in all kinds of ways i'm probably not saying well susan are you on she's here sensei but muted susan yes same here say something intelligent i was thinking about uh a woman not too long ago uh, it's not here for me can you can you it's probably our connection so we're having difficulty hearing you sensei i'm afraid we don't have a good connection, uh she's out in the boonies anyway uh, so let me throw it out to you folks this, uh self self-present underlying right here and because it glows it affects, it charges per se it charges the normal energies that are there uh in dimensional work energies the self present, adds to those enhances those bad mother notebook is a couple other words, i heard from sensei enhances picks up the pace anyway uh, okay so that's why i'm interested in proper position that's why i'm interested in uh, those who are really interested spend some time easing the eye and get to a better, better, level of self some cool things can happen there okay, good for you help where are we here with that sensei uh, you asked me to remind you to tell the osensei story about character, distinct from self and then overlaid oh i think uh, see i to some degree i'm a follower of sensei's work i just changed the words you can understand because in some cases he wasn't very good at that, um, that's what essentia was trying to show you, inner finer self now look at this character who ishiba the warrior uh amongst others anyway look how well things happen because of this presence of self all those other dimensions so he was basically presenting an over self pattern over cell phone no overlay overlaid pattern overlay pattern okay, overlaid pattern he was a beautiful example except for his words were hard to follow but that's what he was presenting okay, what i was what i was trying to remind you of was the story of osensei's own development from building strength and indomitable character, and you're and you're going through a change when he met odisaboro, okay, okay quickly in here he caught on real quick to a development of character okay and he continued that development of character he was a strong center major and he got stronger and stronger and did more martial arts and better and better okay he didn't although he had i think all the pieces he didn't really have all the pieces they were available to him but he meets takeda who is a top-of-the-line jujitsu killer he is powerful and no sensei learns from him to be more better, centered, okay he was missing the fullness of it okay pick that up from takeda then when he gets the fullness of this he has this urge he goes to the gucci okay, the gucci sees him the gucci realizes here's a real potential self is here but he's not quite working it right the gucci helps him to realize self is present okay now for all sensei to pick up easier on himself the gucci also presented to him a lot about the circle to the center okay again i'll send that a bit of it uh but not to the fullness the gucci presented the fullness of the circle to the center and thus the uh when you get that balance there of a great character again the self that was there really, started to show out and soon, now we're gonna get oh sensei, he told me all those other times earlier when he was a tough guy and best, in town and stuff and some people referred to him as though sensei said no, no but now but now he'll accept that oh sensei because he's got center circle which enabled the self that was there to start to radiate to be present you got this beautiful overlay that's all sensei at his best as we knew him at his best does that cover it lauren okay, all right all right uh one of my i didn't mention many times or a few times i'm doing judo and i'm into meditation at the time something's nagging me so i meditate whatever some hours later next i go to judo class i'm pretty familiar with my ability i'm doing a bit better judo better it's better and i realize meditation and doing better judo there's some relationship how can they be related i meditate at home sometimes it's many hours or even a day later i go to judo and a judo man is better what, the hell okay, basically, uh, part of the question i had when i went to japan okay what do these two have to do with each other each other or i was trying to get pretty good in an upper form of meditation dimensional and doing quite well okay and saying wow this is really beautiful, and i said and i said i could sense a little trickle down but nothing major so one of my questions going to japan was uh what does i'm really talking self what does this self have to do with this character i know they kind of relate somehow but i'm not sure how so as soon as i pretty much as i saw sensei i said oh there it is now how do i do it that's my line of questioning joe sensei how do you do it and how do you do it to the level that you got to okay so uh if that helps historically thank you so much sensei and the very natural, conclusion point anybody anything before we conclude totally no thank you Teja thank you elaine uh and you other folks thanks sensei thank you sensei yeah thank you everyone thank you good night thank you in san and next week see if there's any feedback on important stuff this really ah really important thank you thank you thank you sensei everyone thank you lauren

## Experiencing Concepts

**Date:** Unknown date  
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Qu_O5bmz-M

um [Music] so hmm um so [Music] so [Music] true hmm [Music] so and good evening welcome once again to nadosensei's virtual dojo such as it is and uh and uh we'll be going in just a minute or two sensei wants to follow up tonight on really two weeks ago he's laid out a theory of the sponge, as a theory of how we practice and, last week he laid out the theory of the potted plant he wants to make sure that these are not just concepts they are concepts the question is how do we get past the concepts beyond the concepts, beyond the concepts deeper into the concepts so that we actually experience it would be like to be transplanted as a plant or what it would be like to really slurp up and like a sponge and soak up the water not just be aware of the water and uh to be clouded plopped in a plant pot with dirt how would it be for the roots if you were the roots how would that feel you know get all that new nutrients and uh you know be growing so fast can't keep up so, growth is for some people's feels natural for other people it feels like stress, right, being dropped like a sponge into water if you're if you're relaxed you'll probably float if you get all crunched up you might sink, but uh but uh you know we're not sponges we're people and so it's a challenge and a challenge of uh how to integrate concept or awareness and, experience or sensing these are eternal problems in spiritual studies, in every discipline and so now sensei wants to dig down deeper and so uh i think he's just about ready and, here we go good evening sensei hello, oh i'm on hey okay lauren just laid it out we can finish for tonight i'm just uh just the, introducer i'm just introducing you sensation warm up the crowd yeah, waiting for the crowd uh yeah uh yeah uh people don't try to be too late because i'll just get later and it'll get later and it'll be a screw-up so uh please do your best our count for 27. okay, well to uh well to uh wait for the latecomers uh comments on last week the famous potted plant theory anything, anything that you'd like to share observations whatever, hello are you out there uh not yet oh right she wrote and uh, forwarded all that to sensei well sensei just i'll just note that uh you know it's really hard once you've been put into a bigger pot to go back into a smaller pot ah, okay well let's be practical uh so yeah certainly, yes uh on the other hand we have to understand how, it sort of i say pushes and pulls so that if people are in a better pot next day they're again that they don't freak out that that's, sort of natural and you get better at learning how to deal with it so it's not like uh they won't go back to a lesser you could wake up tomorrow and be a bobby instead of a robber it happens okay so yes i agree with you and yes let's also uh be nice to the people here whatever i said yes come on people no comments i need to kill a minute or two here did you get anything out of the potted plants, did you sit with it and play with it well sensei i got it has been a little bit of my focus for a while but in order to move from this pot to the next pot uh, especially you know uh sometimes the plant will hold on to the to the whole pot it might even grow into it material you know but um so what word did you use again kenny here letting go letting go uh yeah so we do have to learn some tricks, so we're all in a pot i'm in a bobby pot often you're in a whatever pot a one by one pot uh god forbid or a two by two pot uh, you're in a fair day set up for a good day set up yeah those are pots okay, yeah, now uh again, kenny what's your word letting go letting go yeah so in that first pot that you are a little tendency to hang on to it okay so okay so some kind of easy settling opening allowing letting go whatever down time do we say clearing, those are those are travel words to help facilitate the, ability to potentially move from pot to pot yeah i think i said that pretty good thank you i, had one other uh, uh thought i guess about it um, and i know we don't want to beat the metaphor you know the, to death but when you're when you're moving a plant from one environment to another a good gardener makes sure that the new environment you know is the same temperature as the old environment the dirt's wet already you know there's a preparation of the of the next level of the next situation um, so that so that when you make that transition you can you can inhabit it yeah okay and okay and yeah if you wanted to military family doesn't mind moving from base to base to base because they know especially if they're officers when they know when they get that there's going to be a place for them your residence is going to be here captain thank you boom and you already know there's a place for you um but to go into the same climate and this and that i don't think we have to go that far uh, because i think level one may constrain it has to be exactly like this kenny new orleans is not anything like california, why are you trying to carry california to new orleans when you get to new orleans if you're smart, ah you easy whatever, word you use let go and, you'll start to get centered and squared away uh comfortable in, the realm you're in the world you're in the new orleans style yeah so we're capable of, of that so don't so in that case i don't want to get too carried away with the plants, it's a little confining yeah but thank you so far so good hello out there i mean it's fantastic i mean look at this fantastic picture fantastic presentation nothing what am i doing here oh this is dusty i'll ask a question that's okay sensei i'm wondering when you pull the plant out, and before you put it in the new one it like it's just it's kind of hanging out there there's no, yes what do you route yourself to yeah you learn as you let go of the bobby pot or, the dusty pot okay, and you're moving into the next level it wouldn't be unusual for the next level not to be clear you're hanging there you're not even quite sure where you're, not even quite sure where you're at or what goes on when you move from a one by two a two by there was a gap maybe where things weren't totally clear yet when you moved from a two-way to a three-bar there was a gap and then things began to show and you got comfortable there hopefully and you became the citizen of that level hopefully, uh but yeah that there's a, little emptiness uh between moves as part of the uh process and you have to get used to it is that okay yeah that's, good i uh the getting youth is hard but that's you better get used to it because one of your majors is going to be when you die it might be just a big dark okay, and you hang out and you experience it whatever, and then the next level of light begins to show so there's a little time where you're not sure what the hell is going on and you're still maybe in the process oh wait i, i'm still bobby no i'm not bobby whoa you gotta be cool man cool, so practice now so it'll be there on the biggies, practice in the summer so it'll be there in the winter okay a lot of these tricks are the same tricks i'm not into a death and stuff really it's just uh going to happen everybody, and if you're more comfortable there you can move into a much better level where some people don't they, they die and then they're panicking so fast they grab the first thing and they don't really take advantage of that time the potential of a finer level to continue their development they died dumb and then they quickly reborn as another dummy to be heavy with it so get used to nothing is showing clearly yet it looks like empty space it's all dark it's a void of hang there wait, it'll, begin to show the night little guy died what tells his name ed yammer yamaguchi yeah california guy from local san mateo uh and he was in japan for a year taking a year off from teaching school and uh doing i aikido and so i got to know him there a bit and uh but he died fairly early heart attack i think and uh as a lot of dead people do he checked in with me and said hey i'm kind of lost here, and i said ed all those years of centering i was on a centering kick especially then i said easy feel around there's a center where you are it's not nothing why are you getting lost and if there's a center you're in a certain domain or world or circle so i chastise him a little bit for forgetting his aikido type training or at least a centering training did you follow any of that okay any anything more on come on this beautiful presentation it's mike i'm from new zealand hey mike yes it seems to me that one of the important aspects of, moving the plant from the smaller plot to the bigger pot is that you have to be prepared as the plant to be uncomfortable to be vulnerable because, it happens, you can't well it seems to me it's not simply going to be a very comfy process to move from the smaller block it depends it depends, it depends as you practice some simple ones you learn the little tricks so when it comes time to do bigger fancier ones on finer develop ones you've got the basic tricks down even though it's bigger the basics retain for example the still will be a center in a circle you'll be in, something and the energy's there of mix up you as a character uh so this uh ah i'm crossing over ah what's happening it shouldn't have to be there that's where you practice the first simple ones the bobby to robert to robert because it's all going on in there bobby sort of has to die careful that word uh and, then there's nothing maybe for a moment we just talked about that uh, dusty right and uh and then it begins to show and lo and behold it's basically the same pattern two by two three by two four by it's a pattern i'm trying to show patterns so all along the way you don't have to get lost or get freaky it's a repeat of patterns yes it'll be finer, but it's basically a repeat thank god the creation created in such a way that it's just kind of repetitive finer the heavier and heavier to finer, the heavier and heavier to finer but it's a lot of repetitive there okay the words may change uh, as you get into finer but you'll feel oh that's the same word i used to use with that when it was showing me heavier but here and the word may change something um i mean like i mentioned last week sometimes i the new one is will just bump me out all of a sudden i'm thinking about my shopping list or something you know what happened and then i have to yeah tricks of the trade uh pot to pot you go into a bigger pot there's more nutrients there or we call it energy if you haven't quite opened enough and you're a little small trying to move it, pushes you that's the first simple basic uh we'll try to cover that in a minute i'll stand and we'll, play with the first settling and stuff but uh but yeah you each dimension let's say is more juice to it for lack of words okay, and, if you approach it to mental it'll push you easier if you approach it easy open sense and you're really open yeah you're more in balance with the energy you're more open to the energies that are there and then they'll begin to organize up a character here but you won't get pushed but getting pushed is great it says oh wow there is something there and it's stronger than i thought i better continue to settle and open some more so it doesn't push me doesn't want to push you, okay but, that being pushed that that's a that's a basic yes okay yeah, i just makes me settle more in the first pot because i realize i'm i always want everything fast you know let's go let's move, i gotta hang out and get more yeah, so i'm going to go through some a very simple approach but you people have been around for a while uh don't dis my simple approach oh yeah i know that i'm gonna just sit here and not do that because i already know all of that it's, really important to, go over your basics really important i don't mind going from one to a two to a three i don't mind that why should you about it i don't need that am i more advanced than that i know you really, know the tricks really, really know the tricks really, for like a word experience the tricks, ah, kind of thing okay, uh and if you get comfortable with the step at a time style did we say uh yeah later you can uh get go faster but i hate to throw that word out i really do because oh i'm gonna go faster but they'll tend to have an idea about faster, instead of the actual, actual i am okay so don't mind those first early stages of process of inquiry of inter-dimensional experience really, check them out because again that the tricks are in the first one you may not notice them but if you hang out you begin to notice them more and they're the same tricks you're going to need when you move for from an eighter to a tenner or whatever okay, yeah, so don't, diss the simple settling kinds of things they're very important mike will we finish with our dialogue um yes basically i guess i guess i've i certainly have reached a point where, i am not concerned about being vulnerable or uncomfortable in the transition so yes you're right i guess it's my attitude towards the process that's changed and basically i, welcome in, good time, what comes next yeah, again i practice more often and it's obvious it's after i don't have any problem of letting go to the next because i found after a while it's only better why should i freak out over the next better but now there might be the knicks better may uh may say uh something uh and bobby's hearing it uh oh you're gonna have more responsibility and when bobby hears that he freaks because he's not capable of more responsibility so there's a little tricks in there but the next level allowed to organize will take care of the responsibility it has the shoulders to carry that weight whatever however you'd say that but again those are just little tricks along the way and also come in easy because you practice at simple levels so you say get used to the little ads and stuff and stuff and, realize after a while that's a waste of time it's going to be okay see when i first in doing my process realized i was in a certain way i was dying, careful of that word because oh my god i don't want to die but there's this feeling of dying but i was on my own i didn't have any reference, uh so what am i trying to say so yeah it caught me and i said the hell with it let's go for it boom, okay and then it turned out to be okay i died too robert to robert died to nado it's hey this is cool so the word death doesn't bother me anymore, okay it's like that right there might be a little flutter because i'm still a human being you know uh but it's a little flutter okay that could sort of ingrain naturally in your system and we practice, practice play bing bang boom take your time acknowledge the things that are scaring you i sort of say them to myself you know just to file them away uh god i think i'm going to die here easy, what's happening easy [Applause], feel and then i realize there's just a change of dimensions or something it's not a death, death, when i'm finished meditating still me hey i'm gonna go have my chocolate milkshake or whatever scored the lady next door in my younger years, ah, i can speak that way no because kacho's out of town for a couple of days but anyway if you're following me this is not don't speak you gotta bear with me with me i don't wear white robes oh my children peace be on to you i come out a yankee person ought to be able to do this process all right i don't burn incense in the house you like incense great i don't burn incense in the house there was a time in the past maybe but i'm brought up catholic i got used to incense in the church my god would heavy incense they use that whatever but don't get locked into those things that's all i'm saying come on come on yeah it's available to anybody come on okay, well since i never met aikido to be just for japanese the process is humankind, process, wow where are we going here uh, anything before maybe i'll stand up soon sensei this is lauren i it seems that you're using this i the, word dying but in the previous months you might have used the word trading in yeah, well i'm just saying in a process uh mike might have actually felt oh i'm going to die here i'm feeling like i'm dying so it's something you feel okay so if you're getting that feeling i don't know if the word trade-in will help you deal with dying, easy and eventually now, who are you so i'm just saying deal with the words experience as they hit you did i say that right yes yeah, so if you think you're dying hang out with dying feel dying continue the journey of dying stay on your lineage okay, uh, kenny's trying to get better with a lineage tool kenny what's yours again letting go uh yeah let go ah, just, a quick moment let go and try to flavor what happens in that letting go may not be much showing because you just let go and you're checking around here but it's catching your attention you have a feeling you should do more of that, there's something important for you there don't change words stay with letting go it's, your thing right now stick with it did i say that right yeah, i like that i will say i, i do like also accepting the word death, and that's just an old thing of mine that if something scares you so much you can't approach it then it's going to dominate your life you know so, i personally uh very much in favor of the being okay with dying yeah that got easy for me when i realized uh that i existed separate from the body and i really began to get a sense of oh my god bodies come and go i still exist i in that case is uh easy the eye self finer level of self that, that piece of the puzzle mm-hmm yeah that one's not afraid little characters in there they're afraid or whatever, but easy, boom, and the self begins to feel be aware and experience itself as self i think this is realization i've been here a lot of times of times and if i choose to i can come back again easy no big deal sorta okay, but parts of bobby was oh no i got bobby things to do so there might be little okay yep anything before we stand, say something didn't say didn't say it's, mark here from new zealand i'm sorry who from new zealand oh god matt will you speak american english for me damn new zealand people yes, um, just, wanted to talk about uh tricks one of one of the things that uh and you can comment but uh when i feel i'm in a smaller pot and i feel a bit stuck uh i'll send a question to myself just asking well what, does a bigger pot feel like and fairly quickly uh i'll start to sense that, bigger room and that wall that was there seems to disappear fairly fast yeah i was going to talk in a moment about that wall walls yeah, you learned faster ways of moving through, um, which i said or hinted at a few minutes or somebody else but don't mind going through the slower approaches and see if there's anything going on that's a constant that'll show up at another level and show up at another level uh if i'm saying that correct i'm saying it pretty good i think but okay i'll tell you what let's stand [Music] oh wait a minute before we do hold it hold it hold it hold it let's see so here's the concept okay now there's a tendency for a lot of people who are more into the awareness intelligentsia thing, to maybe start talking about the variety of plants it's like yeah, yeah but let's keep it simple uh let's go into the soil let's energy let's, see let's experience that let's, experience what roots are let's experience this a slurpy effect this a re-energization effect, let's experience the character at that next level uh so that part of it a lot of people tend to miss because they're aware of it okay, is that is that okay so far so you see patches out of town here's my drawings here we're just going to settle down to a simple basic to start with that guy okay then i'm going to ask you are any of you bumping into a mat would you call that a barrier a wall mark, does it matter uh matt's the other yeah, oh yeah a wall yeah, yeah a wall okay uh going to ask about that if anyone bumps into it then i might ask uh how do you know or what's your experience that you're in this next level i think some of these questions may have come up last week there was a sense that you were you were some people are asking about the earlier stages of, the process i think i think it's what i heard is what i heard i, thought i heard some of those questions okay which sounded like uh i should come back to the earlier and approach it slower and speak clearer about it whatever so uh okay uh so let's do a basic here and now presence standing shifting cameras here [Music] okay, okay what should we say first, ah, be here okay now it's and now again there's the idea but i'm, here what's he talking about i'm here it's not an idea here with some degree of experience okay here can i say feel here we use the body, body feeling its presence here, here in this area and all along the way there are degrees of hereness could i say for example for me because i've been through here before both my feet don't feel equal in depth uh, the left is deeper the right is a little more up turn up underneath, okay that's a degree of hereness for one i can sort of feel my feet and feel that they're little cattywampus as i continue easy here, i'll probably bump into a level on my first basic hereness not really going heavily dimensional now let's keep it simple then i'd say to you how do you know you're here might not quite be the right way to questioning it okay now what i don't want you to do is go let me see how do i know i'm here and you go into the awareness intelligence here, i don't know how do i know okay how do you know you're here, i feel myself breathe and i'm breathing better than however i was breathing before not perfectly in sync but not bad how do i know i'm here [Applause], i'm getting a little support from the ground, whoa if i could jump i, have a little a little bit of springy under my feet i can jump uh, how do i know i'm here one trick i recall i used to tell people in this first settling down feeling processed, uh i didn't promise you it would feel good, as you're feeling you might feel some aches and pains you weren't even earlier aware that you had because you were floating around just being aware separate from your body now we're asking you to be here with your body here, so you might feel some aches and pains you didn't know you had uh, continue through that it i don't know the words of that i make little notes maybe not notes but experiential notes knees could be a little bit stronger they're little i just noticed and i can hear here a branch here brad how do you know you're, here, i notice i notice the temperature of the room just basic physical stuff basic physical stuff he's noticing the temperature of the room or world he's in or situation domain whatever word you want to give it and i had a fee issued i noticed i wasn't um i noticed what part of the foot out my weight was on first so i didn't notice that before so maybe one click behind your level but i felt bad which put me here and not somewhere else are you feeling his feet and whatever oh, he said a good point remember we're not all equal some people may be starting from further out to get here others might have stood up already started here and they're moving along a bit faster so work, yourself it's you doing you so okay so don't try to say what am i doing wrong because he's talking about feet and i don't feel my feet yet be more present here, and now easy feel brad you have another word for feel i think it's an obvious for me word fear feel body presence here i mean with the experience, body presence here experience here is over yeah experience, here is over yeah experience here, here, [Applause], okay, when in my early years of meditation i had a meditation room pillows whoa fancy uh and i would sit but if i was still let's say irked about the boss i said damn him he said this dumb thing to me if i was still in that zone i wasn't meditating yet and i knew it, i had to keep being present settled here be present here and after a while uh how dumb the boss was or whatever wasn't catching my attention and it'd even be a better deeper level here where to think about what the boss said i had to go click, to get back into stupid boss uh that now i would begin to meditate so i, would make sure i was present here to a certain degree that i found proper or satisfying or seem to work pretty good okay i think i mentioned uh jackie's charlie whenever we did uh, hear this i'd say uh how do you know you're here and charlie invited me verbally invariably uh said uh oh all the chatter has stopped as he started to experience this he noticed that chatter would not be there well it was still there if he left this and, and the chatter would be back it still exists up but he's going to be more here and then experience a clear distinct separation from chatter okay so okay now we've we might have moved just in the basic settling i don't know what to say um through minor dimensions okay but it's okay, here okay here now i'm going to really start my process here now there's the next dimension now possibly and who's that mark brought up that he's aware of a wall i call it membrane okay if you're too heavy it's hard to pass through that wall or memory so i don't know hang out for a bit it seems like if there was a wall for you and you resettle double check a bit better settle easy that you can easily pass through that wall okay so something you can do if you hit a wall go back to your earlier softer presence experience and easy, boom and uh as mark said the wall isn't a wall you know you, okay so the membrane isn't a wall it's something you pass through that's why i kind of like that word now so find a way if you had any obstruction any walls would dialogue it after a bit okay now easy moving into more space we're being repotted here the next pot is a bit bigger it's more open may maybe nothing clear there you may still bet that uh letting go or dark downtime sense that's okay it's okay [Applause] are more present in the second pot or dimension uh hope i'm not too fast in my case my first sense is more feeling of depth this next font is deeper easy next dimension i just feel that uh let's move my arm just a little bit wider the pot's a bit bigger [Music] for me i'm just giving you mine yours are yours there's a sense here if i say vague sense the beginning sense of a freer movement capability things seem to move freer here if i wasn't at this level and i were an olympic uh fancy dancing ice champ if i were chen is that his name yeah, figure skating whatever if i weren't at this level minimum i wouldn't go out there because i didn't have enough freedom before i wouldn't have the freedom to do four spins and or whatever there's no room to be free okay so in a certain way i was still in a one by one i need to get into a two by two or a bigger pot that is by its nature a little freer and the energy is there whatever they are for your energy that's fine and whatever they are mix up and the first obvious one is a guy who's freer yes of course no problem but there's more for your end in this in this pot i'm in, this dimension i'm in freeer still seems to be there for your end seem to have more awareness i'm freer and there's more awareness i would know if there's a little bump in the ice over, there i would see then be aware of it take it into account okay now those are mine yours are yours so i think the question i think came up last week of how do you know how do i know when i'm in another dimension easy what's your sense what's your feeling not only heavy feeling now because it gets finer what's your sense experience, of where you are the best i can do in word sorry brad anything to add or clarify help me well i, was picking up i started to move um so first i noticed you know maybe a little off balance on my feet then i noticed then i started to move right and left as i settled more okay fine cool and then i felt my feet pretty you know balanced and yeah pretty, you know balanced and yeah pretty solid so reliable yeah reliable yeah i felt more balanced that way and then picking up the sense of so there's seems like a room has currents and that's a new word tonight yeah some yeah current's moving us around yeah, there's more than just okay a scandal a better grade but there's more yeah so yeah and, for like you know people at this level uh where brad was saying left and right why would i teach you a left technique and then a repeat on the right and the and then a repeat on the right and the left and right if you're not at this level i'm trying to keep this guy left and right so i have to settle them down first try to get them to this level where oh yeah left oh right oh, oh left oh right oh it's natural it's a happening it's not i'm aware of it i'm in the zone and that's what happens in the zone well okay open mic okay simple settling approach where we okay with that again you'll all have your own little tricks but and words but yeah okay [Applause] hello help yeah, yeah okay yeah okay basic yeah basic yeah simple settling huh simple settling right simple certainly yeah everybody survive that get something out of just that sensei, sensei it's nichola from new zealand i, see you i see you yeah um it was really weird when i was first um trying to settle there um bits of furniture around me were really getting in my way i ended up having to move a chair and then move a chair further away but then and then i kind of settled with that and then actually it didn't matter that there were physical things in the room anymore you know the, space that i occupied was actually beyond those physical things jump in they're still there but she's in a different dimension therefore her sense of them is different people listen up this is cool okay, it was cold normal people want to make laws nobody should put a chair there and you have to go to prison if you put a couch there because it's crowding me make more laws yeah but the universe is going to crowd you i think corona is a crowd okay, you better learn to inner develop dimensionally okay, yes, and another story uh, uh, steve from lau you remember uh we had these monthly get-togethers and we'd meet in a big living room but it was still a living room we had quite a few people and i think it was a year plus and one guy was there and he's saying it's crowded well we've been there for you know once a month for a year plus and he finally noticed it was crowded what was happening from the get-go we would do energy or dimensional exercises where it was like she said uh it didn't bother me so it was crowded but he didn't notice because he was in a different level is that is that kind of important that simple but, important hey okay, and i'm and i'm yeah, no you, don't have the obstructions the when you are in a bigger space yes if you're in a one by one everything's gonna crowd you right you're in a three by three yeah eventually maybe something but, not anywhere near like the one by one guy or in baseball if you're a little if you're a one by one and they throw a pitch in close you're gonna jump back and you're going to overdo the jump are you going to be afraid of the ball better level uh yes it's going to come in close but sometimes you know it's going to be tight i'll pull my tummy in a bit but i'm not going to freak out here or what whatever yeah sorry baseball dumb example ah okay so far so good thank you for that uh, that was right any more comments on [Music] the wall the membrane wall were you did, you catch it in some form if so what form did you sense it if you bumped into a wall or anything, sensei linda eskin here hi um i, felt like i had more physical space on one level like i could move more freely and i'm in a little office here but i, felt like i had more physical space but i also noticed i, had more internal space i felt like i could breathe more freely i felt my vision come up and include more like i could see further instead of sort of, tunnel vision yeah, seeing martial art if you're at that level you don't want five guys running around you on a group attack you can't see story uh guy who studied with me for a while new york he was police related he said i got to tell you i went to a gathering of schooling gathering of schooling gathering of police types in florida or someplace he said they showed us this film he said it was mind-blowing it was filmed so good and what it was, uh a herd of wild cakes and a uh some kind of cat cheetah or something and the camera's taking the cheetah's view and he zeroes and he sees a little piglet who's on the edge of the crowd of pigs he's oh lunch oh lunch and he just keeps zeroing in on it okay and he starts to make his move and he's running towards this piglet lunch he doesn't see because he's this way he doesn't see one of the boars spotted him and is coming around to get him as he's making his approach to borah hits them in an instant all the pigs are surrounding him they're going to do him in and he jumps in friends and gets out of there and runs uh but the point of the of the movie was to see this is a problem when you focus you don't see other dangers there and he loved that film and i like the story of that yeah i care about focusing ah, so thank you linda did we cover it uh absolutely thank you that thing behind you that beautiful wall and water i, don't know what you're talking about, the small office you're in you look like you're in a great expanse there it's a beautiful picture, thank you it's a park in the san diego area, go ahead and let your virtual background down linda [Laughter] show us the letter in your office let's see can i turn it off hang on a minute oh gosh there we go none yeah there it is it's actually a walk-in closet, my office is a closet i did my best spiritual work in, a closet it's a chant in a closet so i wouldn't bother the neighbors anyway uh, okay are we okay with walls anybody else's walls any sense of a wall okay uh, basic trick don't get too heavy and try to fight the wall it sort of fights back easy, you can just pass through it and you're easy so again go back to your basic settling being present easy and, should be a certain level there where pass through right, mark would you agree with that, sense i'm trying to say yeah the, walls um just evaporate yes yeah it's almost it's there but it's almost, it's there but it's almost imaginary i, don't know the words here yeah it's real not real if you're thick and dumb they're real you settle and sense things better it's almost not real yeah thank you okay then we moved into how do we know we're in the next pot or dimension or three by three instead of a one by one uh, or you're in the land of a good day instead of a bad day or fair day uh how, did you experience uh being there because i think that question came up last week how do i know i'm there i, think if i remember i may not i may have misheard it but it but, let's, stay with that how did you know experientially you were in a better space let's talk there a little bit no let's start them off i'll just sit there looking at the screen jesus my body felt lighter and more permeable and, i started out i just finished dinner before so i was a little bit sleepy the first round and now much more awake all right all right okay so you use your body experience to feel the next level yes okay, uh, what about that's fine no problem uh what about those who just had a, sense of a bigger space or a sense of something energy-ish anybody with that how they knew experientially they were entering the next dimension this is lauren i knew because i wanted to move movement started happening yeah it's a movie the body's being affected but he wants to move yeah okay somebody, let you know that soon got an added level of call it energetic heat in my system i'm sorry energetic heat, h-e-a-t, yes, energetic heat and something that's a hint for me is there's a usually a little emotional content either a little anger in there that can be in there that can be a little joy but today just anger not directed at anything but it's just people to remind you something we touched on some time back uh first levels of settling uh energies well of pretty quick potentially show the emotionality of the energies or people pick up the emotions okay, so it's not unusual in the early stages to pick up the emotions okay the sadness would be where somebody stops there and emotes that would be sad and if they're emoting all the time you get bored with them and if it's overdone and overdone you probably divorce them i can't take anymore uh so how to deal with those properly another discussion but uh yeah not a surprise also the extra energy showing to you or manifesting to you as, heat or warmer yeah one of the first things of playing with energy and just keeping a check on your arm hand this always gets or usually gets hot in the palm okay, and then bob in the early days of energy healing we would use that we'd be at a level where oh it's really, hot and we place that hand on the poor sick person and help to heal them yeah ah it's all energy in it and we'll find a way that level of energies and you're experiencing the heat of them again for lack of work you're experiencing the heat of them uh somebody of the opposite sex may say oh he's hot hey cool because you're manifesting at a better set of vibrations that they term as he's hot she's hot how about that as a little sideline we got to keep sex in it to keep people coming to the show or listening, okay anyway uh how did you know you were in the next dimension what was your experience in the next dimension we haven't heard from everybody hello out there hi sensei this is justin hi, as i settled into the, next level i felt a sense of quiet and calm that wasn't as noticeable or tangible in the early ages of the game yeah, again in some cases we can't get the world to be quiet around us but, if you'd like it's here for you, can go inner and get to a calm world and learn how to what's the word retain it, how to uh take up citizenship really fully experience where you're the calm person, it's not just an idea of being calm because just the idea it doesn't have enough oomph to it, doesn't hold together well i should be calm but the kids are still screaming ah you kill the kids, the awareness of what you should do doesn't have enough doesn't have body to itself okay and because it doesn't have the more of that it can't emanate that naturally not that you should try to emanate it at other people but you said it should maybe naturally happen where when you come in the room calmness pervades the room or if you're into a different quality beauty pervades the room whatever a little aside there so the experience the experience uh that we didn't really touch on that enough did we in the next dimensions or the next pot let's go back to potted plant here the next pot okay has better soil in it okay therefore more nutrients okay i'll get a little fancier here has minerals is that the right word for potted plants minerals yeah okay minerals in it now we know that okay and knowing that you might get a bit but not anywhere near what we need or what is there for us, but because you get a little bit you might think well i was aware of it and i felt a little bit therefore i got it and it's like not really i'm sorry but not really there is the hanging out with this energy called finer soil finer soil hanging out with the nutrient sense of it, for like a words in taking the nutrients letting them mix up if you would that's what they're trying to do so all of that mixes up a better plant or character who is actually has that stuff doesn't have an idea about it but is actual actually how can i say that better it's like what i'm bitching about all the time if you if you've been following me for a while, the idea is great we need to start someplace but then there's the experience, okay now careful because there's like a halfway point i think where you start to be aware that there should be an experience, and, you learn about what some of the experiences should be but it's not really fully the experience not really because you haven't followed your roots down to the bottom of that vase the nutrients and the fuller you plant the character that's there you at that level that peace is critical, okay, very important all along the way very important, all along the way now along the way as the pot gets bigger and bigger finer and finer uh and we're pointing at that we'll head towards it for example through the manifest dimensions, eventually going to get to a place that i call the domain it's where you're starting to get free of the heavier okay it starts to get pretty fancy at that level plus, and there'll be a tendency because it's fancier it's brighter it's uh oh wow all loving and stuff that you shift into awareness about it and not really be the character of love or power or intelligence whatever that you're supposed to be you're aware of it you think you got it okay, it's kind of like the sponge uh being aware of all the water but not soaking wet beingness okay right so this experiencing actually damn what words do i need here experiencing actually the next pot and the fertility of the soil, and the minerals whatever minerals you need they're there and they'll come into that system because you're at that level okay and we're talking about healing a couple weeks back or whatever you get to a better level be that let that mix, be that character, and that's an inner level of self and it can naturally emanate so this inner finer can emanate its level that passes through the energy body physical body whatever natural potential healing is what we tried to present with that healing, potential pattern have i said anything intelligent yet several times over and over again when i go through like oh sensei stuff or whatever uh feel it and feel it again and feel it the next day and feel it the next week until i better understand through the experience of feeling it okay i don't stop at oh yeah i read it and i sort of understand what that word means, feeling, oh another story in japan no i, don't know the of the per anyway in japan dojo time uh two words used to crop up benkyo and keiko okay my sentiment was benkyo was to study keiko was to train or practice okay so benkyo the awareness of could i say some knowledge about okay see i'm giving you knowledge here with that layout okay i'm giving you an idea i'm giving you a an awareness of something, big kill big kill but now it's up to you because we don't have enough time here uh to practice the keiko of it the feeling of it the actual keiko, in japan our benco time was in the coffee shop the local coffee shop and we'd a lot of aikido philosophy and what no sense they mean and what did this teacher know what that teacher do uh and we just bounce ideas around and stuff that was been killed time but then we all had to go back to the dojo for hours and actually practice experience now watch out for that mid place i'm calling it today uh where you're aware that you should be experiencing even aware of sort of how to experience but it's not actually the fullness of the experience, okay so file that away you want to check and then you want to double check and then you want to remember i presented at one time the idea is like one this inner experience is five one to five it could be one to ten, it could be one to fifteen one to twenty but, this is easy this, takes a little more practice in certain way it's slower it doesn't mean it's dumber it's just a bit different okay, i try to say that in dumb ways i can think about kauai a minute okay we'll really get into it i can almost smell the flowers okay i can okay i can feel the ocean coming in and going out and i get oh yeah i can really get into the awareness of it to actually be there i gotta pack my bag i gotta buy a ticket i gotta go to the airport it takes a bit longer but it's okay i'm going to hawaii kind of thing okay so i live with the extra pumps of experience, take your take your time really feel a lot to be gained in that feeling experience actual okay watch out for the intermediate because a lot of you have knowledge about what's supposed to go on here double check triple check okay ah i think i'm pooping out here say something anything fairly simple so anything on the simplicity you don't quite catch or something then we can hopefully clarify or help uh it's mike again i was just going to say that the for me the, the three words that resonate with what you're talking about and it's, no big deal but patience persistence perseverance um you know you know kind of the approach you have to have that this isn't a one chapter in a book that you learn quickly as long as they don't get stopped by those words and how great those words are settling into the depths of the earth and checking its roots and feeling that so that's my only or worry there is that you begin to love your words understood yeah nice word now doom get your ass in the dirt dancing this is justin again i, really enjoy, how practical and ordinary this can be when lining up to everyday routine things in this way and not making a special, thing i do only in the morning but throughout the day checking in and bringing the self on more engaging with the self so to speak more in a more ordinary practical household way if you will, that's why i present simple dumb things remember the one i think i presented uh, uh one of my common practices when there was a flight of stairs was to stop for a moment at the bottom of the stairs even though at that time i'm a young jock i got shared i don't want to do anything special but i would stop and just this sense of okay i'm changing from a walker to a stair climber boom and then had that guy go up the stairs and that was a bit different didn't take me long i'd do just a fast one it wasn't you know the supreme level of stair climbing but uh noticeable it was noticeable yeah so i i'd fit those little practice games in yeah, uh for my development and for fun gave me something to do while i was doing nonsense like climbing stairs yeah, did we cover it uh justin, yes quite, well i was reminded just as an aside about yogananda that whole lineage is uh is for householders in particular you don't have to be in a monastery or in a cave somewhere how do we make this spiritual technology available to the, everyday you know thank you averages of the world in my younger years story uh i did visit yogananda's ashram in wherever it was la steve what hell is it it's in santa monica right by the beach almost, suns sunset almost down to the beach anyway, i visited because i'm really beginning stages of my meditation thing so i'm interested i go down check it out they show me around whatever i hung with it for a bit that sense and i realized then that it wasn't this life to be a meditator in a monastery that this life i was going to be uh what you're saying uh, justin in the world uh a householder, holder a screwer upper, indeed for sure will said uh that it wasn't i think i i'm i i'm into past life stuff you know i i've done, more than one monastery existence i, like it it's kind of easy for me but not, this life not this life so that's what i picked up pretty quick just being there it's cool but and i could do the standing on my head was also a feeling that was there this is easy it's gonna be easy but not, this life so but we can function from a better level of ourselves in everything anything, you know you're gonna drive your car you take a moment you sit settles a quick sense of inner driver and even if you only do a couple of moments later you get pretty fast at that, and click this mix character is just a better driver he's already a little more aware, he's already if he checks his fingertips he has a little better touch on the wheel, he's already a bit more settled with the car okay i used to use uh do that maybe a little bit better but on my drives down to big sur because that 101 of 101. that highway one big sur coast road, uh, and i would get into that better driver thing, and i used to drive a lot of old cars cheap old cars and but when i did that every car felt like a sports car i was like wow there was a kick yeah so it was extra practice for me made the driving easier made it fun uh so yeah it's like it's there for you if you want to bring it, into different aspects of your life go for it for it i mean isn't that what we're trying to lay out it's not like we just want people to learn aikido to learn aikido i'm gonna learn this inner process, so that let's keep it simple so they catch a little bit about being better centered so they're better centered when they play golf on the weekends they're better centered with their kids at home they're better centered at work being better centered a better sense of presence a better more awareness of things going around whatever, whatever okay all right what can i say and sensei it's uh yeah and 10 before eight and uh perhaps other people want to chime, in last couple minutes for chimers let's go what have i missed hi sensei it's autumn hey autumn heaven i've seen you but i haven't heard from you for a while what's up there you are i was curious if the sustainability comes in with the experience with the practice of it i'm sorry i missed the word there if the what comes in sustainability like is there more um mileage in, really delving into the experience and how you know experience versus awareness, sustainability was the word ah okay because i'm partially going deaf over here brad sustainability, of the inner person do we think, sustainability of again if you hang out and pump the pumps for a while uh let's say um let's say you got to go out or there's uh you have to present yourself and you have to have an extra little bit of beauty showing okay you're right uh, even though it's kind of a natural easy for you still you want to put on that extra, glow, so there's a concept this is what i need help starting to come into play so i open because more of it is coming into play the energies that make you up as glowing more beautiful, it's an inner glow of beauty okay and i just can't do that once and now walk away, okay, you stay with the pump here's the inner energies that makes up beauty mixing up beauty, and other things are starting to come in for me probably would for you too where i feel more i don't know gracious, calmer and, kind of gracious easier to share a little bit there's other things that come in on that so you're not just beautiful and you're dumb or you don't have anything else going for you, know you're not one of those uh but you stay with the pump for a bit you, feel it and as you open continue to feel it, organizes better fuller okay that's what i meant by the one to five and it could be one to ten one to twenty but i'd stay with the pump for a while all right that's being in the uh the dirt part of the uh of the pot where the nutrients are your you're assisting being open to the nutrients mixing up what you need so we're saying you called for more beauty whatever uh that's, what's gonna see that equals that, equals that, have a relationship mind body harmony is the dumb way of saying it okay, it's deeper and finer than that but, that, pattern okay you've seen me do the i have an idea i'd like to stand better and then after a moment ha, hate and i start to get energies to stand better but if i'm really, going to do it i'd like to stand better and i hang out in the lower part of that pop a sensing feeling making kind of like a make-believe that you're actualizing [Applause] standing better i get imagery a lot i'm seeing two springs i know if that means i've seen them before gonna spring up through my feet but let's pat let's go past that easy, i know that yes springy feet yes and yes and i want to stand better and it's mixing, mixing and i'm getting more musculature i'm feeling my muscle my muscles here i, i hang with it and i soak in it i mix in it till it makes up the character did i was that any use yeah it's a way in yes yeah uh, see i think i think a lousy actor, has the idea about the character and in some cases they don't do this part of the character so they have an idea about it but you look at them and you say it's a shitty character it's a lousy character something's missing, okay, the idea of the character nice read the script and whatever but the work is in allowing those energies that'll mix up that character and you're a natural like that you should be with the little practice here if you understand my words very good at that okay and then if the director says uh pic, pick it up a bit you'll go okay click, a little bit more and you'll pick it up a bit if the director says could you tone that down a bit oh okay tone it down a bit and it'll still be those energies but they'll be toned down a bit you'll, be fast at this i mean this is your thing you'll be damn good at it okay but yes the idea doesn't sustain very well very well if you have an idea you're a nice person and i prod you, know i question you which i which i, tend to do with a lot of people i pop their balloon uh it's just really to say that's not good enough, and if it's just that alone it's okay get this second part and they've got some substance to themselves, they're actually there boom and for one thing you may not want to check them out because it's obvious that they are what they said they are all right or if you do check them out because they are whatever you're doing it's like water off a duck's back it's like yeah right but it's not bothering them because they have substance uh, a better integrity of the idea and the energies there's an integrity okay boom all right nice, nice yeah, yeah, and sensei i think that's just where perhaps we should leave it tonight me and brad are going out for pizza because we're bacheloring it tonight thank you thank you sensei thank you so much thank you autumn and everybody else sassoon and mike and just you cincy mark thank you everyone and thank you good night all right and good thank you well done you said so and you said it so well i'm so proud of you, said something so well glad you kicked me out of it but of it but it was you said it really, well it was really cool i agree mark i think i think so too i think so too thank you oh now you're muted mark's phone is muted cool thanks we should mute this yeah caught on the hot mic really good okay yeah all right good night take care over there good night everyone good night everyone

## 4 Patterns to enahance your Experience

**Date:** Unknown date

first, um i want to uh thank you i appreciate the donations uh that's some catch my attention this last week thank you very much i'll mention this again if i remember to at the end so that the late comers are included in the thank you figuring this stuff out i go through a lot of coffee what coffee do we drink here what company uh starbucks, i go through a lot of starbucks coffee hell of a lot of cigarettes to get all this stuff organized, if you let us know we could have gotten a product endorsement that they would have paid thank you for your donations anyway, okay, okay so uh some of the basic ones that we've been using there are others but some of the basic ones that are uh seem similar to each other the one by two, by two by two or three by okay uh we're going to stand after a bit and because i really want to uh, work more on the actual experience of the energies in these dimensional openings okay uh then we have uh bobby robert nado again same pattern there inner finer dimensions present here finer so you're operating from finer in a heavier world okay uh what else do we have uh one rectangular right uh, uh a bad day it's a bad day nothing's working right easy subtle potentially a fair dash it inner finer dimensions open up it can be a fair day continue the process next big step a good day okay so you have some what's the word not control over control this should be a proper word i don't know if control is it uh but you have some ability of shifting to inner finer anytime you want to okay uh again if you practice it more in the summer it'll be there more in the winter when your things are really glad going a little crazy around you and stuff so practice part of the practice will be this inner experience not an idea just of practice but the inner experience of the energies that are there this is important we'll be going around on that in different ways for uh for a while uh, i think there's a fourth one was there body plant a larger pot better soil those are the interior energies, and they mix up a better plant or meat okay so there's similar patterns right just a change of words helps people um, give you a different slant on the same thing, okay where are we where are we where are we, um let's see um, [Music], autumn you're on tonight i saw your name uh that was a good uh comment or question about sustaining, the character uh it really kind of followed the same pattern, but uh, but uh, but it's such a good question it does come up how do i sustain i'm in a good space and suddenly it's gone and i'm gone and whatever how do you sustain and, that's so important i'd like to give it its own session or at least a major part of a friday coming up soon i don't know when but coming up soon okay i'll make sure you're on uh but that's a good one how to sustain uh this inner development this inner beingness okay, thank you yes uh i don't know where the hell uh last week what did we do last week brad what did we do last week uh we went over processing potted plant i believe working the potty plant the process okay any, anyway hello out there you can open your might ah before we get started on tonight uh any comments on sensei linda esken yeah i'm happy now how are you hey as well as you expected yes i've um i've been playing with uh a sort of unexpected process i stumbled onto it and it's been working for me this week where, i just found a piece of music that inspired me to, shift to a level that works better for me in one area and um so i've been i've been playing that in my head and it sort of calls me into pulls me into a higher level so you know rather than like you might do a standing opening breathing it's like here this song in my head helps me kind of jump up to like you know i found myself doing things that i doing things naturally that would have been very scary or effortful for me yeah, there are different forms of using assisting things to move dimensionally okay if i might this is my nothing's up there better finer up there it's here it's here we keep going up there uh, we're going to get more into the awareness of it and begin to lose the experience of it so sorry i'm bitching but just uh keep it give everyone a heads up careful of our older style of spiritual awareness heaven is up there uh and all this icky stuff is icky get out of here i got to get to heaven i'll go over that uh more clearly another day soon i've even got some notes down uh that i've been making on that but yeah music sure inner finer sensing of the music fine finer, yeah sure yeah sure there are a lot of different ways okay, to facilitate so yes thank you somebody nothing's going on in your life well, the, peace that strikes me as you keep emphasizing this word you know experience and yes talking about the upper realm is i'm somehow picturing your early years in judo and how totally body that has to be in order to really handle those movements and how someone who meditates i'm wondering if there's ever a way for them to begin to touch on what you're talking about and any hints any hints i dismiss the last part a little bit richard could you say that again the last sentence or so well i'm, wondering i mean i i'm wondering short of going and training judo, even more than aikido but something in that dimension to really get that thickness of experiences like this is not a head trip how do we can you help anybody, yes okay can we hold it right there right there, is physical training judo but there is inner body training interdimensional training and the judo doesn't take care of it all those heavier things we do don't take care of this inner dimensional energy body that's the difference yes i was not bad in judo yes i was a pretty good jock yes i was a gym rat pump those iron day, day after day but week after week month after month year after year i was a gym rat, but the but the interdimensional development took me a while to figure out how that worked, okay, so my physical capability of being physical is not what i'm talking about well let me let me try this once more i think approaching the inner awareness coming from the body presence that you had as opposed to where most meditators are starting from and i guess i'm looking for cheap tricks you know is there anything short of getting on doing that kind of bodybuilding stuff to get physical and i don't know there's no, no, no don't you, don't have to get heavy in the physical to get started just a body okay a body now inner finer inner finer you don't need to be a superman uh physically or, the greatest jock in town to do this again i was pretty good physically but i still didn't know inner dimension acted that's when i that's my question when i went to japan it's beautiful here in my meditative dimensionality it was gorgeous, i was going great done spiritually but does it really, work here i knew there was a dribble down okay and it affected me a bit but, the fullness of this inner and that's when i saw no sense i said whoa yes it does function here but how do we really get at the level here where it functions here i don't know if i'm saying it well but i think i have a layout coming up soon not tonight but soon that i might say these things better, uh but it's not that you can run around the track you've got body that's it that's the end of it but we're talking dimensional, i can't say it for right now any better that good enough to tie this over richard thank you thank you thank you thank you tigers over yeah i'll uh try to go over this whole scenario a bit better on another night soon yeah see that's why we're bringing up words like inner sensing experience not body experience yes you start with background now inner uh tj are you on tonight he's not he is he is one i'm here anything about inner body as to what we're talking about where it's saying yeah no, it's good it i'm just trying to think of something good to say here that would be uh hopefully useful the uh our practice of, in the meditative way of working in if it doesn't include the body in the way that, richard was noting uh in the more physical way with martial art like with the uh with the judo it doesn't have to have that kind of intensity to still be very uh central, because meditators will lose it by coming up into their heads and uh and just spend a lot of time kind of in the i don't want to say fantasy world exactly but, in the abstraction of, finer so-called states and it doesn't really touch into the fact that you need to connect that into the into all the dimensions of our being which of course includes the physical body, and dimensionality that exists what to say at that level at that arena at that arena right and without that you don't get the uh the groundedness you get people floating out, and abstracting concepts and it can be very fine it can actually be very beautiful, but, but uh the i think one of the gifts of aikido is that the way that it brings some aspect at least potentially can bring the contemplative aspects together with the embodiment and that's a real gift that's, pretty unique yeah there is some of that i we could say in uh the chinese arts like in tai chi but just like it's rare to find in aikido it's rare to find it in, tai chi as well and so we shouldn't broadly say aikido will do this because a lot of people true and the inner sense and what happens uh there are degrees from very little to a little bit more uh but it almost like we have to draw the line and say how old sensei performed ikea though where he was coming from what level he was at in his performance or the happenings that were happened or a great tai chi master not everybody in the park in san francisco that's written your arms around uh kind of thing that's nice he'll settle a bit and all of that uh but the great master tai chi he's, got something else going on there that his inner is affecting the outer and he's special, so i'm speaking of thinking of the greats, yeah anyway blah, blah yeah one other thing i'll say that i think is uh is important and relevant is that you've helped to translate the, the meditation, uh aspect or i would call it the contemplative aspect it's really working with meditation and the art of aikido um in my view of only having practiced aikido for a mere 50 years uh, it's, pretty rare to, have that um that connection so i'm just like everyone here i'm grateful uh, if you want for a moment uh, teacher did a write-up well under his title tj roshi, did a write-up for a uh a uh dr yang or young doctor young yeah uh a buddhist priest and taos practitioner and uh i uh he sent me uh what he wrote uh and i, told him i really liked the phrase uh a grounded actualization i kind of like that word now i don't know what people are gonna do actualization and whatever uh but grounded and in that realm dimensionally actualizing the energies internally that actualize that yeah, yeah and if in actualizing the inner finer you happen to perform better on the outer so be it but you don't need a better outer uh to whatever we're trying to say what i was trying to say to richard it's an inner development that may manifest outwardly right, exactly sensei the, the point about actualization is it's not just one it's not just a an on and off switch it's not just um a particular place it is a growing yes it's not one level that's a good way of putting it yeah, yeah and it continues and continues and continues what's that animal running around back there yeah that's, one of my kittens uh she's a wild one they're, all over the place okay we i'd better stand here uh, people are, we okay so far sort of kind of yeah okay, all right just a reminder uh let's see how the cameras work over here okay i don't know if you can read that but it's uh one by two by uh bobby robert okay one by two by okay so uh, we'll pass on the one by that we were a sense of inner, opening inner opening certainly, grounding if you would inner opening there's a sense here a little more room if i got a quick image of it i, saw a little bigger circumference okay, let's call that a two by two you see you see as i hang out in the two by two i don't know everything yet i'm just my earlier presence with it in it to my center starting to show okay there's a center don't forget there is a circle and a center circle and just a vague sense of movement so let's call those energies in a two by two centered encircled a bit more room than whatever one body was energies now by law each dimension should be finer so these energies are finer than here two four for me and finer, energy makes up a better centered character okay now here not just an idea ah, what to say here as if uh as if uh breathing in the energies i sometimes call it slurpee the energies are a sense of they're active and they're mixing let's try to check the body's reaction getting a little wider in the back a little sense of running straighten more not perfect feet connection but not bad or better than it was so there's an enhancement on this inner feeling, [Applause], body inner energy body okay and, at first i'd be hard to feel myself as this inner energy body but i can feel a reaction by my physical body straightening a little stronger in the back, uh feet aren't bad i'm not great but they're connecting fairly [Applause] i do i want to do a lot of movement i wouldn't want to get into a boxing practice now i'm not but to just be present ah yeah it's very easy basic simple body moves and i'd hang out in a two by two continuing to experience the energies as they mix up the character me i'm a two-by-two ah, i'm beginning to breathe deeper as a two-by-tour not fantastic because i'm a lousy breather but i'm starting to breathe a little fuller as a 2x2 uh my rib cage seems to be opening up i have a little more i don't know i'm not so congested a fair sense of things i'm almost ready to smile not quite but i can sort of feel that soon, i'll break out into a smile so this inner niceness radiating now to my physical [Applause] and the sounds i'm making are not trying to make that out it just happened it's about to level on that okay so, and then if we're going to continue under one by two by three by we'd move into we'd settle this one down trade it in whatever your words are and in that trade in we've moved into the next finer dimension, so whether you're using a dark down or a trade-in we've talked about the different, forms easy the eye easy the eye and that's the eye let's go of the two by two easy it's part of that opening to the next and next will be a three by three and we repeat the pattern at a three by three do the same thing that the energy is mixed and all of that but i go through all the same things center circle make sure there's more room to let me know i'm actually in a three by three the energies will start to show the three by three show a little clearer than they did in two by two and, and again show the kind of visual i don't see that uh it's a sense of feeling showing it just seems to be more color, more aliveness to the energies which i didn't feel that much in the two by two i'm sort of sense feeling it now and we just continue the same pattern okay, so, ah shifting forms patterns, bobby robert now go bobby beautiful guy bobby and white in right languaging, [Applause], as bobby settles easy, the eye bobby easy, as he settles he's moving towards, a potential next dimension easy [Music], the next dimension starts to open and show, or i didn't sense experience that happening in this sense a little more room, [Music] just a word i don't have yet a feeling experience of robert this is an approach to robert's land the dimension that mixes up a robert easy you should do not think that that's easy let it begin to show more room energies, mixing starting to feel rotten a little chestier i could take a half a punch a little more positively here in my macho form uh a little more hey i'm here hey not ready to fight but hey, hey i'm here i'm here okay, so this inner robert [Applause] his, mixing up mixing up inner rubber you can begin to feel that emanate out to here oh he doesn't walk so much as the beginnings of striding robert [Applause], and then we go into after you spend no time feeling uh your attitude your view on the world your philosophy after you feel so i would do feeling first and then and then what catches your attention what interests you in the world something like, that okay so you get the fullness of robert his body and his viewpoint philosophy attitude, okay so okay so and not though would be a continuation into the next dimension where the energies are finer and it would mix up a not go and we could continue to whatever form you want to use not those sensei or whatever okay are we all sort of okay so far [Music], the other pattern bad day fair day good day okay, you're getting a bad day it's like a not a one by one say one and a half like a one and a half uh, one's a little tight the way that we first presented one okay so easy, this bad day i'm dropping my keys and things aren't quite clicking and i seem to be not quite with it oh okay so noted okay so there is that world of bad day in the character whoever is in that world's a bad day you see i settle i trade again i do a bit of down time whatever form you like we've covered before different forms here's where uh you might want to turn the music on and use the music to help move you into this next level and then that brings you to a fair day easy i've got a little bit too much mind about the bad days i'm not, good enough clear some more fair day you should have a sense i'm sorry i can hear the word it's easier or be easy something easier oh let me think about that word not now not now just stay with the energy sense of things here oh yeah [Applause], yeah uh slow things and it feels it's the early beginnings of sensing it like liquid flowing just the early stages but flowing easy on a fair day seems slow a bit lower my reaction uh if i were to come out and check the physical if i had a tight thing here at this level it, would be much looser and so more fair dick has more room don't forget your base roots are brown [Applause] free or flowing [Music] and sort of a halfway well things aren't so bad or things aren't too bad but they're not great yet it's a fair day and it's not bad could be worse fair day and i hang out and there'll be a mix and i'll be a fair day guy in a fair day circumference a fair day okay and then we continue the pattern and do the same thing for a good day okay we're on how to play okay now the importance of the potty plant pattern is the soil that's the energies of the lower part that we've been trying to play with a bit here uh so it's not just oh how many different flowers can there be and oh that plant is similar to that plant that's all very nice awareness stuff but in the actual practice the size pot you're in okay, playing the potted plant science taught you're in the soil nutrients, sometimes we call them energies are there are there and because they're there with their energies minerals whatever, whatever ah, the plant the plant the centered me being the plant the plant sucks up those little mix and the plant is affected i feel taller [Applause], fuller, okay so taking advantage of the finer soil or finer energy dimensions where the energy is finer and letting that mix don't forget the roots or base ground we have different words because they should go dimensional it should also be a sense of a little more jet to include the more of the supportive energies the other half of the picture you got the awareness half and now you've got the actual stuff half and we play with the soil and the nourishment of the soil like we did, the other forms okay that it's mixing or the plant is in taking the nutrients from the better soil if we move into a bigger pot uh then there's more uh what's a pro miracle grow the soil has a lot of miracle growth in it, and so wow you really light up ah, but the sense of this stuff is being important not just the idea of it, oh yeah, the finer energy uh oh yeah oh yeah, the finer energy uh oh yeah supergirl uh dirt oh yeah got it i understand that's, it well sometimes they put in your body that's an idea it's a concept fine great gotta start it but now there's this part this part this part [Applause] inner finer if the inner finer naturally outflows so you probably produce a bit better on here that's nice but that's to me secondary it's a secondary check it's this inner sense of experiencing this inner experience, that's important see not to put aikido down but some people they settle they get a little inner sense of being settled whatever and then they perform techniques you know it's better and then they well what about this technique oh and what about, this technique oh and what about that technique and, and, and they just continue out with the outer, of things and forget the actual experience continuing of internet and i say they after all tend to pay lip service, oh yeah we know that philosophy we do ikea but knowing it and actually hanging it out and mixing it letting it do what it's supposed to do again that's critical okay we have open mic going up so tell me like everybody else am i crazier when you watch bob move in his body like that don't you know that, that's a level of training that's like, you know it's special but again i remember bob just if i can get a little humor in here the one guy who said the minute he saw you he knew that you had it more than any teacher he saw it was just that you smoked cigarettes so he couldn't train with you and i said wait a minute wait a minute that's one of bob's best qualities that's my mo anyway uh, but if there's better movements is because there's an inner character beingness okay, if i stray away from my inner and get into bobby land i can't move very well you throw three attackers at me they're gonna kill me i have to get to this level and then things begin to happen at this level okay, so i work the dimensional level and i check out her just to check, out her just to check for a moment not hours and hours and hours of outer offered a little bit of inner i got you're going the wrong way the other way around, a lot of inner a little outer check fine more inna you want to check out her after a while okay but do the inner, inner, actual experiential work, okay so major in that and i don't know just say minor in the outer i don't know if i said it great but again, we're going to come around on this topic in different angles on it i want to go over again a bit with uh, autumn's good question comment about sustaining uh another, soon on a friday we'll do that uh might want to lay out a bigger picture of our history of uh being upper finer meditation let's call that the age of awareness and, now more and more i think should be the age of experience the experience okay and that's why the tai chi masters have come up that's why the uh oh sensei very good that's saying yes it's time for this now time for this so, anyway it's a different time i want to lay that out hopefully clear clearly i hope where the hell are we people anything on anything inner sensing the finer energy dimension the energy there will mix up a better level of you are we getting sort of okay with that sense comment if anyone has a comment please just open your mic evening this is sassoon i'm just going to piggyback on autumn's comment, a number of times i've done my mixing and come back i'm doing well and then walk into a day and walk into a door so to speak and i've come back to processing but the sustaining part will be a very good i think will be a very good piece too well i did all the things it felt good and then and then walked right over the door and it lost it all you lost it yeah, very common very typical so we'll cover, uh when we cover this uh maybe next week we'll see the ability of sustaining it for a longer period of time to be pretty much based on what i'm doing but we'll bring it up in that context of sustaining okay, and what happens when we can't sustain it uh what are we doing when we lose it uh, stuff like that but for next friday or whenever and maybe just let people know how often it can be done you can come back and do it many times a day and get faster and quicker and you mentioned osensei, does it and can do it in a moment i've often done a walk to the water fountain and back and try to go through the process again used to be one of my practices when i first came back from japan was working in a, factory and i would practice from my workstation to the uh bathroom or water fountain that was that was ah gave me a chance to practice for a moment, at coffee break i'd often go hide out behind the boxes and practice actual practice yeah practice, right thank you yeah but we'll try to cover it better when we cover that uh sustaining, question, okay, sensei this is tisha again it's huge again uh yeah so the uh i, want to lean in just for a second to the thing that moon was mentioning and the uh was talking about as he noticed how you move and you can see that development in, good aikidos that have practiced well and wisely and good tai chis that have practiced well and wisely over time but it comes back to that word that we were using earlier the actualization it is another word i would use in relationship to that is a quality of embodiment and that actualization is really for you and for, those of us at our various levels has been uh integrated into our system so it's very fast you know you don't have you're laying out the map for us in the process but actually it's pretty darn quick maybe even instantaneous in some yeah but before we tell people it's instantaneous and i have an idea about instantaneous and that won't be it so you really should not mind i don't mind why do you mind i don't going level are you people yeah yes you must be you people uh mine starting at your bobby level if that's where you're at and, and going over the basics oh i'm bobby oh no but i should be the great nado sensei or, the great spiritual being and you're trying to do it with an idea and it won't be quite right so yeah if you don't have that map if you don't have that map then you can't get to autumn's uh sustainability yeah, get very familiar with the map don't mind don't mind going over the map yeah, yeah don't be uh be uh don't get so idea superior that i don't, get so idea superior that i don't need a map i'm this great being that's it you screwed it all up it's and that's arrogance yeah for sure you're here so but as you go through the map and you get really versed on, the how it works and you're present with it and at certain levels you're soaking in it and you're you get very comfortable with how it works and then someplace there you'll be able to skip one hit so in that hit you're already changing so it can get very fast but again, don't mind going through the stages nothing wrong with that it's very important, don't know how to say it any better yeah, so we always have to be careful of how fast it's going to get because some people, have that concept and they won't actualize it there we go it won't be actual it'll be an actual idea but it won't be an actual, actual eyes embodied real you know we would call it real for sure and again i'm gonna change the word instead of end body which sounds like my physical body uh finer inner can manifest outer yeah anyway don't, mind going over your first simple steps even though they feel like baby steps double check them see if you missed anything in low through these many years is there something more there in that first simple process of bobby to robert say for example uh that you may have, missed something uh i don't mind double checking [Applause] being open and said well i know i'm bobby the robert oh yeah i know all about that well that's it if there's a little thing you missed in there uh you may not catch it because no i already know that uh so sometimes i'm honest huh honest huh i teach you help me with the word here uh honest i'm open to anything that i may have missed in doing my uh my kindergarten approach or my grammar school approach which is the word open to yeah, i would say authentic, it's not a bad reference for me give me another word um, genuine you're not helping noah very good mom based on absorbing the nutrients of the level you're at based on what nutrients absorbing the nutrients at the level that you have actually, fully, absorb the energies of the level you're at and, and be open for anything you may have missed there i suppose i know i've done this before to hell uh take your time take your time i might have gotten vitamin a but i missed vitamin c could be yeah, yeah you got a vitamin a you say oh i got this, is easy uh but, you may have missed there's a vitamin c there, yeah, so yeah i would say be open i don't know be open for correction or be open for additions that you may not have noticed [Applause] the allowing of the more of potential of things, even at these earlier levels just to double check and then tomorrow double, check and then tomorrow double check again what whatever something i like that sensei this is tom hey uh last summer i was planning in my garden, i had the starter, vegetables and um oh here let's see and being very absorbed in the soil and the nutrients i was putting in the soil and, the starters were happy i was nurturing nourishing the situation but suddenly i got nourished by it i, felt, open to a greater sense of self and you know while i'm nourishing i was also being nourished and, that's really stuck with me as part of my process of being receptive yeah there's all right let's see if we can add something to that uh in my early years i used to like hanging out with the tree i don't know if you could call me a tree hugger but i didn't mind sitting in front of a tree or near a tree and, sort of getting the flavor how the tree is with itself and in doing that then of course within my system things were going on if the tree sort of inferred it was deeper than what i could at first see then shortly followed by oh i'm deeper i have deeper going down here uh if the trees said to me uh i draw a lot of nutrients from my uh roots, yeah uh and shortly thereafter oh, cause i'm similar i draw nutrients from this deeper root and i draw nutrients so i think you're, trying to say that, in doing that your system at a certain level mimics it or does its form of it or something, yeah, say it better than me tom you'd get better wording than i do well no, there's a active experience and a passive experience there's a receptive experience where allowing the experience to happen rather than trying to direct the experience and so i see so i see these things happen happening simultaneously a lot even at training and in my experience of, um of um my dimensionality as well it comes out of dimensionality could we also say that, some people are aware of the process oh better soil and the plant's going to use that it's going to grow better i don't know what to say or could we say that if they were if they themselves were little more settled and open while they were doing this then it'd be quite possible that as they're enjoying uh setting up the plants that they begin to oh, i'm being nourished if they're and maybe because they're aware of it and they're i'm gonna do a good job and this is this is in this minerals for the plan and whatever uh but somebody's a little more subtle ah might naturally be you know my god it's affecting me yes yeah, healers have that, healers have that sense you can't heal somebody unless they're grounded and you have to be grounded too but in the healing process one also is healed is healed when one is teaching one is learning while they're teaching they're actually i've heard from many teachers who say you know now that i'm teaching i'm actually learning more imagine my technique is better now whether it's dance or aikido or golf or whatever, i think is better now that i'm nourishing, another's technique mine has suddenly become better yes, and yes yeah, there's a short form of that where, i learned a lot being a good okay really feeling what they were doing and just being really present i, learned a lot which sort of fits in there someplace but anyway yes yeah, thank you tom thank you hmm didn't say it's not ikea oh no the strange i will we'll try we'll try i was just going to add you're looking for like a word um each time it's like a new experience a what experience a new a new, brand new brand new thank you brand new experience uh yeah that, that's good i, often have that sense as if this is for the first time brand new yeah, just so i don't carry in my uh i know all about this i really can't learn anything you because i already know everything uh it's brand new, that's a sort of for me an honesty factor and an openness factor yeah i think it's kind of important um thank you uh [Music], for that sensei sean here hey sean there i think that um another well, there's a curiousness a willingness to be curious about um how i can uh notice more and be an experience more just be more, me more capable, yeah as you were talking the word inquire came to me again yeah, in choir, yeah well or, for me it's more like a curiousness or to be inquisitive about um how um how, things are different you know i mean like first how things are different what's that how things work how things work how things work how things are working you know currently i mean for me i jump over, as you know i that sense of like um skipping a little levels or something i, feel like there's a um maybe an arrogance and, it's that his sense of being humble and curious actually curious about um, [Music], what's, currently going on what is the feedback i'm getting you know i feel like i, do yes i can see where i project yeah um let me jump in um that's what i do on my front porch i, inquire about how things work that that's where i spend hours trying to let things unfold and clarify to me okay a very important piece of work now, should we say you're running around in daily life there's a lot of things you're not going to really set up perfect to go get a hamburger, okay, but you should have hopefully some time place in your life where you do settle and inquire or what whatever be open to whatever doesn't mean you have to do it oh wait i'm going to stand up now and i have to do this and this and this uh there's a lot of stuff we just skip on i, don't think i do a lot of spiritual work when i go buy a hamburger or a cup of coffee at wherever i go to uh all right i think we're allowed to jump over to small things of life but someplace, see i can't one reason to go to aikido is i can't do that in aikido i have to get present and begin to open up or i can't perform right so it forces me if you would reminds me if you would to do a process okay if i didn't have aikido i'd have something else okay anything i used to like to throw a tennis ball up against a wall bing, bang, bing, bang uh because i would use that, to settle to settle and i get a little tired of missing the ball or something and settle get to a better level and bing, bing so i, would always come up with something to remind me uh about what i'm going to call it my practice my process okay and i think it's good to have your major like aikido or whatever and uh and another one side one i, think it's cool it gives you a double check a different angle all right for example if steve were in l.a steve it weren't aikido guy he'd have his baseball as major and his aikido as secondary or vice versa just as a that's a double check on how things work a little trick of the trade no okay if you get something out of having a minor, check practice feel free where the hell are we hello out there hi sensei it's mike from down below [Music] uh well the, words one of the word two words that um that come to my mind about kind of the state that we want to remain in, terms of um just progressing in life is curious staying curious and also staying humble um, two qualities that i think are good for, not allowing the ego to um overwhelm us okay and again we should have taken the ego thing ego thing i wish maybe we should have started with that easy the eye [Applause] okay, so that, identity of the self that's wrapped around in bobby and wrapped around in robert gets a chance to disengage easy the eye is a good travel trick to move into finer and allow the things of the finer to show and be there and hopefully to be experienced at that level in that dimension i don't know if i said exactly what you're saying but i liked what i said hello out there i was also i was also going to say that um one of the, things that's um i've definitely come to understand over the years with you is that and it wasn't my way of looking at things prior is that even when i'm in a very small negative space, that all the resources i need are there it's just that i've, almost put up a wall around them it's not there's a scarcity of anything it's called the membrane if bobby's locked into his world so we've talked about all the tricks of recognizing it and the ability of moving into the next dimension those walls aren't brick although you may feel like it at first not really not really easy, so we learned certain tricks to pass through those walls easy the eye is one of them breathing could be used another one using music to help transport you from a heavier level to a finer level sure whatever, whatever okay we lay out a few examples uh but then find ones that are cool for you that do that do the, job the same job could we go ah, so yeah so yeah um, i think your word for the, walls you use the word membrane and i actually think that's a really good word for, looking at those perceived barriers that stand in front of us anyway thank you yeah thank you i was in solitary confinement for a short period of time and uh in my bad years and uh very tight space uh i immediately started doing inner work, inner finer where i had more room so the actual physical walls that were here weren't, on me because i instantly went into this finer dimension where the centromere room was there and maybe that those walls are still a fact of course but this is a fact this is an experiential so i mentioned an example following exactly that of the la group uh, back when uh when uh we used to meet in a big living room but a lot of people and we'd meet there once a month i think and spend the day uh maybe the weekend i don't remember now, and after a year plus one guy said hey it's crowded but it took him a year plus that means 12 13 14 15 sessions of being in the same room with the same group of people noticing it was suddenly crowded because we'd immediately go into energy dimensional work whatever we were calling it in those days and in that inner finer there's more room so nobody bitched about it being crowded because it wasn't the same if you were in the normal body then it's crowded inner world body sense of things plenty of room so same, story same sense see a lot of our problems we have in the world is things in the heavier bother us so again let's make a law against that yeah fine, but let's go to an inner finer dimension where maybe you're not bothered by that okay maybe you should develop your inner self instead of just working the outer self okay, uh, but, you can debate that i don't want to get into that debate but that, i, like that sense of it yeah anyway, not for correcting others just for correcting your own mind yeah, how can we stop the wars well at the moment i don't think we can they're fighting all over the world they have been for year after year for generations uh yeah it's too bad but you better find some inner peace or inner harmony or inner understanding so that doesn't drive you crazy okay, all right all right and if in being in inner peace and enough people are there potentially a whole bunch of people with inner peace maybe there wouldn't be any wars because they don't have be operating from inner peace we just don't have enough people three is not going to be enough to fight that 300 million or however many there are who are into conflict whatever, but take care of yourself take it to yourself take care of yourself, take care of yourself develop yourself yeah at first i might have a selfish sense to it but it's not really because you'll get the true self which is not selfishness yeah it's inner development inner where the truer self can show so, it is very it is very personal but something like the word personal it's very personal at first in the bobby robert nadeau levels we have to try to disengage easy the eye because that personal is uh a little weird normal weird so we disengage from that one but as we continue and the self gets clearer present clearer, it's very personal in that the self is experiencing how the universe works and how those energies mix up and a better level of self so it gets very personal but we have to collect the words depersonalized early in the game to then get to a level where it becomes very personal but not at an ego level it's a it's a much better level and, words like uh we might use with a tight ego uh aren't really proper here they don't feel right or they don't exist here hopefully now there might be some weird guy who can continue into finer and finer and be really weird it's, feasible anything is feasible jesus but uh, not really not really ah how do we get into that where are we reporter of where are we sensei we're at 7 45 p.m pacific daylight time thanks guys thank you okay and so uh we can wrap it up anytime you'd like okay hang on a minute okay holding again for those that came in a bit later i want to uh thank you again for contribution sir welcome to royal received okay, starbucks likes when i come in and you are doing bob you done for the night you want to talk a little bit more what's up for you just hanging [Music], as you were talking about that last pass you know there's a phrase they quote for most sensei i don't know if you ever heard it but he said something about reciprocating echoes i don't know if that relates at all for what you were talking about but my sense is, your work is your work and, it still affects everything else even though not as much as you might wish reciprocating uh okay when you talked about reciprocating it wasn't so much i'll be nice to you and you'll be nice to me although that happens, if i'm in a better zone the sales people probably smile at me and oh and i'll smile back better so there's that kind of reciprocity words are hard for me uh but he's also talking about the great beats, of the universe boom, boom uh now we're getting into the truer bigger of things so yeah it depends what level you want to play his words at and i don't know if i said anything intelligent they are useful at the moment i appreciate it i, feel like it's it because it isn't really one or the other it's this i could you know i can't talk about it because i don't understand that's why i don't teach bob okay you may have heard the word tonight in quite in choir possibly you want to go there and let it unfold inquire, the actual the actual energies, that exist also in the inquiry as opposed to just a mental bouncing around whatever, you want to do anyway, hello out there anything before we finish up sensei this is uh liam robertson hey, hey uh i just had a question maybe it's for a another day but just uh, what um what um was just brought up and what you've been talking about, looking at the uh what can we do to kind of notice the signposts, between the inner and outer energies as they're kind of coming uh say the outer energies you were saying smiling uh okay you're talking people level here yeah people level and then how we work that, to find out okay in, people level you know their, outer energies because there's joe coming at you yeah dinner is this inner sense of things i'm sorry i'm being a little facetious with you yeah no that's fine um but now but now okay as you go finer in dimensional finer, there'll be both the inner energies and the, world in the finer the, the world or circumference you're in circle center the circle and circle to center but both of those are going on uh at a better level on in your inner system, so we have that outer inner, outer okay but you brought it up like out here in the world yeah i got facetious with you no that's fine um maybe to ask it better too is this how, does one stay notice how to stay better balanced with that outer inner, outer i think we'll cover that bri bring that up uh when soon maybe next week i don't know soon we'll get into the sustaining piece i think that question will fit right in there okay great thank you okay yeah so i do say it again that way when we're doing that chill just all right thank you thank you refinishing up people sensei this is uh bill huey from um from san diego um a trainer dave goldberg i think you know where i am i come to mountain view occasionally i try to forget who you are but we'll let that go for now i haven't seen you for a while i've been lurking i've been looking around and uh i just don't talk because everybody else is talking i just want to be polite because everybody seems to want to talk to you nobody else is polite why should you be here join the club sorry go ahead it's not how to roll i roll rough so i got to be careful so i'll just say that okay this little code between me and you okay, so something that happened in the last couple years for me and my training with you is i'm able to have the inquiry of fullness and i ask myself when i move and i take your chemi or whatever it is and it's the same thing i found is front back left right i found that there's a certain fullness that is expressed and i can ask the question of my body am i symmetrical am i full and if i'm full, that often gives me the answer to the technique that i'm that i'm not doing right and what i'm working on right now is not just big movements with our which are big and obvious but in something in a more contained space because it's a little more subtle and it requires deeper listening and i wanted to tell you that that's what i'm working on right now and thank you for opening up for me yeah uh, yeah both, have a place the uh a lot going on in the smaller movements a lot to be seen in the bigger movements but yeah both, did it that we had a professor of jiu-jitsu the area he's probably still alive he's one of the ancient ones uh and he created a yes i know who it is i just didn't know it throws the name out uh and he created small circle not quite sure but it would seem to me that he was doing this smaller form of things, uh, and putting a lot of emphasis on that and experience with that to make that's my, guess and he had done the like you know with me uh or not with me but we trained in the same dojo when i in my early, my beginning days there we go and i was wondering if he didn't catch on something in the aikido where he said oh yeah and started to work the smaller the smaller of things just my guess i don't know but anyway something to be gay not a small and something to be gained out of big yeah so yes thank you thank you for that i'll, mute now and kill my video thank you okay by the way good to see you um i, miss training with you and i miss you personally and i'm sure a lot of people feel that way as well and um if i can come up to mountain view i would love to train with you again but uh but i just wanted to express that sentiment to you okay thank you yeah, we'll see we'll see we'll see uh people did we burn that one out nice words bill yeah that was very nice and sensei i relate to that is he's creating some sustainability between uh changing from large to small or spatial reference it reminds me the spatial reference thing reminds me and sustainability reminds me of i'm going into the grocery store i've got my list i'm in my car and i've got my five things in my head i come out of the store and i've only got two things and what happened i went into a bigger space there were more people and the lights were brighter and i'm like i know i can do this and i'm, 70 years old but i'm not there there's the answer right there well hold on a second that's it you're a goner yeah i hear you but anyway this whole concept of sustainability and spatial reference and, what he brought up seems all slow for me so uh that was very nice yeah, yeah okay thank you people thank you sensei thank you very much sensei next week thank you very much thank you bob thank you i only did a moment you know of uh slurping the energy and mixing i only did a moment more than a moment come on 10 minutes more than 10 minutes you know well what you what you said about you know you're walking to the water fountain i mean you couldn't get any simpler to say that it's there all the time and i, really guess i want to acknowledge too i think i caught that early on i'm very grateful for that piece and it means it's we're always or should be yeah, always training yeah and there are times where you just go to waterfront because you want to drink you don't feel like doing a process, that's okay but someplace in your life it would be nice for you to ah practice that's, all okay so no hard fast rules you know i'm not that catholic and if you don't practice on your way to the water fountain you're going to hell uh we're not going that far people you know but do the best you can thank you thank you thanks again good night thank you so much everyone thank you all thank you good night good night everyone see you next week lauren thank you so much thank you moon yes thank you to the team as always is a very special gift and, you guys make it happen thanks mike how's danny doing

## More Clarity: From “I” to “Self” 2" 6:30PM  PST 4/15

**Date:** Unknown date  
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mJZjj3XPFo

and so good evening everyone and uh sensei will be with us in just a few minutes today's uh theme is just a continuation the sequel the continuing story of story of developing more clarity from eye to self sensei felt it was very interesting session last, week and there was more to more to [Music] cultivate in the along this line so he's gonna probably pick up from where he started he started i just want to remind everyone that next week friday april 22nd there will be no class no virtual class next friday i'll put that in the zoom chat and we'll send email next week as well but if you want to make a note no class on zoom on friday the 22nd and then just pick up again on the 29th all right so let me just see if sensei is ready to go, one moment please yes 10 years yes sensei good evening good eve thank you hey, hey okay, we touched a bit on the eye itself uh anything, uh, uh, just to get me going that you want to say about last week observations little insights confusions whatever nothing nobody let's jump on there i said say uh bob here a bomb there i think one really good part of the class last week was the relationship with the energies that begin to move around as you do easy with the eye and how to work with those so that they don't interfere with the experience of easy with the eye and then as you progress toward itself yeah uh yes one little problem uh we'll, have is the lack of a languaging so i'll try to help us create a language so we can kind of communicate with each other but we don't have off the top a language for the levels we want to get in or for our approach okay let's try this see this big sheet of paper here okay, in the beginning okay, uh we're starting to get past my pay grade now but in the beginning whatever name you want to give to self a consciousness is one, word for self at this size okay uh the first self that pervaded that, was going to be the arena for creation that's that clean sheet of paper self is all that is self uh or consciousness whatever word that you like then we for whatever reason we lost this fullness of self that we originally had uh, and somehow we got involved with the creation that spirals in spirals in okay uh okay uh in and out spirals and is finer but gets heavier and heavier and heavier okay so here we only see a second drive here we are see if that's big enough you see that yes here we are [Applause], in the very heavy okay i make a joke if we could have gotten heavier instead of being a human being would be a rock that's how it was working okay heavier, so, as a human in a pretty heavy level okay if you remember your one by one uh let's even tighten it up a half by a half oh my god i'm, heading an insanity here it's so tight okay there's an eye in there well probably when you start the eye is sort of up here, i, what's he mean by i that's me isn't it okay but anyway the i is here in relation to you the person now we want you easy the eye so it so it goes uh back towards more of itself as a clearer piece of paper so, let's say here with that uh there's a clear paper so as we easy the eye say that's a stage of easing the eye and the paper is bigger that's the eye okay, oh boy the languaging you see the eye you see the eye you see the eye so not just an idea it's very important we don't do everything up here which is the awareness that we involve uh the fuller of things so, which will eventually include the underworld bad word isn't it uh the lower parts of the nutrients of the vase we're in kind of thing uh, okay so easy the eye the eye at that smaller size is a bit elusive with the hells and eye okay it's a bit elusive so we'll turn it around the other way and start with uh ease of the eye and how do i know that the eye is easy we'll use the body as a reference bear with me because the words i'm trying to come up with decent words here uh, okay so standing and we'll go over being present, just being present easy the eye into the eye a sense of a bit of opening and i, liked last week the sense of the eye is elusive but will you use an airy, feeling or sense an airier sense easy the eye so this what's he talking about, each easy, easy, this size right here easy the eye sent some more room airiness just a bit more now if we're heading in the right direction if we're doing it right bear with me on these words okay for doing it right, and it's a little more easier the eye how might we know there's an easier the eye well let's use the body for reference let's, start come at it the other way here oh i was very tight before with my tight date today but i i'm a little more fluid a little more breath same word immediately more air in my joints air in his joints air in his joints i'm surprised my arms even moved that way because really when i might feel more like this kind of thing easy how do i know ease of the eye is happening because the body is getting a little freer just a little free it's fine a little freer body not just an idea again let's start right and let's use this whole system here okay ah so with this amount of easing the eye the body is a bit freer okay so this right now is not a one by one for me it's a at least a two by two yeah two by two or uh, not a bad day a fair day someplace in there it's not a great day yet for me yet so each of the eye lets the body be a little freer okay is that come across all right from here, okay let's go one more easy the eye [Applause] a sensor moving into the next level of it again airiness a sense of a little more room airiness openness ah i'd say freedom but no that's what the body begins to feel what's your sense of the easy behind this is there a proper word brad to get a word for just easy the eye scariness more comfortable more natural okay but isn't that the body in this size i feel more natural i feel more comfortable yeah but let's just i'm trying to isolate the paper if possible maybe it's not possible and that's why i'm reversing okay so sorry about that uh anyway a little more the next little level of you see the eye easy, easy the eye and now we'll check and see how the body is doing as a reference are we on the right track are we heading the right way no i let the body, easy ah oh yeah ah oh yeah, it's, moving better it's grounded a bit better and it's able to do that fairly well huh nice i like it i like my experience the breathing wants to change wants to improve, in this more room for feedback that we're heading the right way the body will give you some feedback that your eye is easy yeah, yeah longer for me a little better connected for me for me a little oh yeah a little straighter for me the body the body so in that ease of the eye the body gets to be a little a little better body it's straighter, ah it's breathing a little better it can reach pretty good not fantastic but pretty good in reach it can grab and hold within reason if you catch a ball within reason, no 90 mile an hour pitches here just a little something yeah so that's my uh using it the body as a reference for ease of the eye it's giving me feedback okay let's take a moment there we'll come back let's take a little bit okay so as the eye ez the eye went into easy the eye the body using my example uh the feet connection was better was better the balance was a bit better let's shift left shift right uh the arms could move outward a bit better it was breathing better ah straighter started getting more centered it was straighter ah so that closed me in that i'm heading in the right direction again for lack of words, easing the eye and then checking the body to see if i'm on the right track i don't know if i like these words but let's try them where the hell are we you didn't notice your body got freer should be soaked yeah if somebody got tighter i don't know what the hell we're doing here okay all right gotta get a little sir open mike you can say something i don't mind listening now and then i should say dude later uh my arms were feeling longer and the body was definitely moving more freely, yeah, freer movement yeah easier the eye freer movement okay, [Applause] everybody got some freer body movement to some degree nothing fantastic but it should have been somehow freer okay sensei linda eskin here yeah linda i um i, felt like more uh diffuse almost like i could breathe more freely i had more space but i also noticed i felt a little more solid like i had better balance i didn't need to struggle to maintain my position in space it felt more centered i guess yeah and, what, uh, i guess we could have expectations but, to let the freer body in that in the space of ez bi a freer body does what it wants to do if it gets heavier it gets heavier if they want to say hey i'm improving my breathing so be it if it wants to say hey i'm getting straighter so be it i don't make rules for it should do this and then it should do that no we do it this way this way i do ikea and this is the way we, use our arms don't put rules on it now, okay just trying to get a sense of easy the eye the freedom of the stuff in the system in this case it's we're starting as humans the stuff in the system constitutes your body and you notice easy the eye the body gets freer gets freer lines itself up better breathes better whatever, its joints move a little more fluid whatever, ah, not controlling it just ease the eye and i don't know the words see how it works enjoy, the workings of creative forces of which the body is a heavier form but it's still following the form easy the eye damn the words anybody anything here we'll listen to another input i sense it's just it's dusty i felt more freedom yes from behind my shoulders up to the top of my head, i don't know why i feel more freedom yeah no okay now, don't jump into that i just say ah easier than that and just let this do what it wants to do now we're going to potentially, screw it up oh why is he doing that let me think about that and, suddenly what we're doing is we're not doing it anymore so let's not be uh and, i don't know an instant examiner and jump onto something is that god there's, a little bit on the top of my is that god trying to talk to me through the top of my head stop it easy let's just let's just let it let it let's just let it let it stop trying to be an intellectual stop trying to be smart stop trying to detail uh people help me with words but noah stop trying to don't think about it feel it experience it and as you begin to experience something there'll be the potential to think about it of course and i pass on it and i continue with enjoying what it's done okay you're with me there dusty yeah, you gave me that advice last week because last week i kind of wanted to we're talking about ease of the eye and i wanted to jump out towards something you kind of said the same thing like you said just i want you to just focus on your center and yeah you feel good when i do that so you have to understand that i'm a nag a nagger oh my god he's saying it again yes and i'll say it again and again and again uh hopefully trying to come up more clear explanations that's what i'm trying again here which is all those energies moving on is free to do what it wants to do at this level and at this level it's a body, and it's showing because the eye is a bit easier there's more paper that the, body is a deeper a straighter a fuller a looser a looser whatever more capable i can catch a ball within reason yeah whoa, whoa holy who would have thought i'm going someplace with this uh but let's uh huh let's go at it one more time you all right let's grab it one more time [Music] okay so again the word or the sense of an i a little elusive okay a little elusive so what we're doing is sort of coming around the other way and saying well at least let's, say it into the best of our ability easy for moving along [Applause], a little more airiness close enough ah a little more room close enough easy the eye and now the eye is more easy moving into a little bit bigger piece of paper okay, in a bigger piece of paper double-checking easier the eye and the bigger piece of paper the body is freer experiencing the body freer is it and if we're body freer should be a little bit better than earlier for your feel, body free body free yes my extension is better yes okay one thing is easy body is free or easy oh the breathing has improved before there's something here and now it's a little more it's breathing in a little fuller the chest is expanding it may have last time but not to this degree i don't really remember that but here it's noticeable rib cage opening with this amount of breathing, [Applause] and i feel some limitations with the rib cage uh but that's just because of the level i'm at it's better than it was before i don't get all negative because oh but it's not perfect you don't know how to say that right but easy enjoy the positive things you're aware of the negatives oh i'm still a little hard to really straighten up yeah but you are straighter aren't you so i don't know how to say that well but uh highlight the positives you're aware of the negatives they'll be taken care of as there's more easy the eye paper okay, easy in more room bigger piece of paper self, the body as a reference ah, what do i feel like dude i talked before about catching a ball here i wouldn't mind uh throwing okay stirring the ball back and forth this is almost fun okay whereas before the sense of catching a ball was okay but to relate and throw a ball back and forth to have an exchange with brad to start to reference brad that wasn't in the size i was at, this size i don't mind referencing brad and paul okay very good checking your body not a lot of thinking stay with the feeling, feeling ah, the eye that was crumped up in a less than a one by one has, moved into a better level of itself what i call more paper ah bigger piece of paper ah there's really no obstruction from this size i to this size i to the size i to the size eye, should be a fairly easy journey potentially yeah okay so what should we call this the second level of easy the eye body let's hear what you have to say about this that level teasing the eye freer body is that more obvious to you, all had improvements right quickly, i said say this is justin i guess why i, did feel an increased and sense an increased level of, of up and down and depth and comfort and freedom in my body but there was also a, sense of the person being more available and pleasant there was a pleasantness and an availability of person um also, i was more absorbed i, the body i uh body comfortable freer but the i person uh experiencing the body and its freedom was available and pleasant um demeanor that wasn't quite as obvious to me in the first set of easing the eye yeah so as we continue it's not just the body gets freer but as we continue other things are have room to come into play attitude changes a little different viewpoint on the world you're more open to other people or whatever okay uh don't mind if i paraphrase sometimes because uh, it's the best i can do so yeah okay so any anybody else a freer body better body sensei hi it's nikki from new zealand um i felt more awake and my hands and feet were getting really warm [Music] yeah no more cold feet when you go to bed at night yes do your little process anyway yes yeah the warmth is usually more energies are pre in more room the energies get to move better so should be so on a tight body there are energies but in a tight heavy body we're not we don't notice the energies as there's more room there's this level where the energy should start to flow through the body clearly, okay did i not say that right if you don't have a certain amount of room don't go to tai chi class because you're going to be the fool there you won't be able to do the movements anywhere near properly you got a blank look am i not saying this right are you hearing me help me help me i think you're saying it very well she had a questioning look on her face it catches my attention uh anyway okay, sorry cola are you did sensei answer your question enough sorry yes um yeah, that was fine thank you thank you sensei okay, all right okay uh continuing this nothing big piece of paper here uh so if we get to it, easier the eye okay, see we're not the detached from our, more original self that original the whole page self we're, still connected to that for the old, timers i used to use the word stringer if i have any old timers on stringer meant as tight as you get there's still a little eye in bobby who's connected to and connected to and connected to this whole big piece of paper i call that a stringer now in the tightness you can get torqued and get weird but as you ease the eye unwind those other things we've done easy settle ah, open unwind easy the eye we're returning i back to the more of itself, and in the more room when there's more room uh more so here a body got freer uh here in uh here in uh in florida's example uh not only was the body freer not only was the body freer but the body was starting to have attitude, adjustments help me again it was uh pleasantness availability pleasant and openly more available to other people and things ah so a lot of things are going on because they have the room to go on so more room more things come into the picture there they were always there but if i'm this size less than a, one by one not going to be aware of much except but as you open as you all these nice things will begin to happen, okay, so that, was a good example it's the beginning continuing as uh you open uh, energies get to flow better we're still body level uh get the flow better through the body so of course the hands get warmer i always got a hot spot here, uh, it should be natural starting to flow better, if you're going to do tai chi alright i guess, at least be at this level or you're wasting your time trying to straighten your body get to this level get to this level body is straighter anyway so as we begin to experience this i after a bit i is a little a too small a word my languaging and it starts to call itself, self, okay so when i reach a certain level of size, it seems like it naturally changes its name, itself, okay, okay and then i make up a bunch of words that's, my words but follow the pattern ah, a finer self meaning more paper a more original self not the most original self but a more original self a clearer self so that, i, use certain words to just remind me and guide me along to more and more and more okay so again find your own words even if you got the sense of that pattern that we're just uh increasing our page presence increasing our sense, experience of easing the eye self that's there at a certain level will begin to show it's there oh boy how am i doing with the words you hanging in there all, right where's the time going that was great jesus, uh anyway so are we okay if we yeah you see here their energies going on thus they mixed up, your body your body you, the character okay, in more room we're still using the body it's a freer body it's a straighter body it's a more balanced body it's a and then uh the added in uh a change of attitudes is part of that part of that okay what am i trying to say here that as we continue the easier easy the iron did bigger pieces of paper uh that the that the energies of creation are there and they'll continue to in and out and up and down and create uh a much better character a much better character that's why coming with bobby robert nadeau as a dumb example find your own words okay, so the better we can ease the eye self easy the self in a certain way we're, at a better level where how energies work in the creation get to work at that level, if we do it properly they're going to show their harmony [Applause], after a while they'll show much more qualities, uh i think you started to use the word some quality word what, was it uh pleasant or available pleasant, yeah so don't start to come into the picture, yeah uh remember some people in a process uh, get emotional well as you're opening those qualities that, a little heavier level we call emotions are just nice qualities as you open more they get to show their true colors so it's not just emotional reaction uh they're really better qualities than how you're emoting kind of thing uh, so anyway do you see the trajectory if we can uh following this pattern again i like patterns that can go the distance if we follow this pattern the whole universal structure at its much finer dimensional level those energies in out up down the mix of the great character as you get fuller and fuller and fuller here, you are you are okay, uh, when a sense i said uh sheba of aikido he was talking about a hell of a big character, because aikido wasn't in the dojo idea for him it was the universal uh creation uh workings the actual workings so he was of that level so he gave it that name of aikido as opposed to his level one which was this old man this old man but he was able to go very fast through this very fast to get to ushiba baikido which means we can do it fast too not as an idea but we'll work on some trade faster trading in tricks i have to be careful again of the word fast i'm afraid people have an idea about going fast uh and, they won't position they won't be here in the middle of it as big as it gets it's here as fine as it gets it's here it's not heaven, is up there i'm a poor human being stuck down here there's heaven i won't go any deeper because that's hell down there that's the underworld that's horrible don't go there we got to get off that kick okay so as you easy and open do it full bore here, and full bore means a little sense of deeper, and of course deeper has higher and higher has deeper but do it here, here, here, here, the inner finer is here of since they would say don't go anywhere it's here inner here and it unfolds that it's here through the inner recognition inner experience inner presence with it so anyways do you see how the pattern stays the same as we had a little easier the eye the body got a bit better as we continue let's make a big jump here into uh self, easy the self, much more room much more paper much more room for the forces that are there to show better how they work not just to show how they work but to be experienced how they work and because of finer dimensions things like beauty power intelligence joy whatever it's all it's all there and you'll bump into some because you're you and i'll bump into others because i'm me but we are we all have some so let's get some i don't know if i said anything intelligent but damn the time is eating out like crazy damn help since this is going again justin can you um, make a comment about maintenance or sustaining, that okay we're back to sustaining i was out last week if you touched on that i apologize no, no it's all right because i do have something more clear to say about okay let's see if you just have an idea about your character like uh, you sort of hit the area of nice let's say so you say, oh, oh yes i'm nice i'm a nice person if somebody nagged you, won't be able to sustain that niceness it won't take much for me to blow you off because it's a little bit of a bloom for me and i'm famous for being a balloon popper, if it's just an idea and i pop it i'm not screwing you over i'm just trying to say that's not good enough, look how shallow it is look how, fast it disappears easy let's continue with the word nice, easy, now, the center of that that's sort of the circle of it intake nice and a couple of other things nice and what and what now you've got this plant that's rooted that's nice it is nice and you're going to be hard pressed to push it over with a little dig because it's got a good presence the alignment is good the positioning it's got a good position the idea about this is not a good position it's yeah it's a piece yeah, yeah but it's not the fullness of the position that's my whole sense i like that diagram there we go that diagram you got to get both pieces you got to you got to get both pieces you got to get the center in the circle and the circle in the center and you continue with that because that goes all the way in this vastness of the original there's a center in the circle and a circle in the center very fine energies at that level pure image i don't know what word to use just perfect energies creating a pretty wow character at that full page level okay so can you see the lineage i don't know where to use between what we just did we're just getting this body to say that hey a little easier the eye and i, move better i feel a bit better, i feel a bit better to boom to boom the possibility of doing the whole page okay, that's what i would call the goal folks now let's try to make bigger jumps so we get to itself faster okay so we do a few levels of easy the eye ease of the eye and then we get to itself after a while you people okay uh it should be able to start with it's just the first ease of the eye and boom go to itself you gotta be able to what's the word brad what's the word shazam yeah kind of a shazam type to a certain level not shazam through the whole universe, and yourself about your whoever he was uh but of just a faster movement i see i have to present step at a time to lay out uh, the pieces the pieces and the process once you get a sense of it you don't have to go one to two to three to four you can go one to four you have that capability instantaneously okay but i don't want to do it just as an idea because you're going to lose the positioning which is so damn important the positioning you see a lot of people oh yeah i understand they will be able to do with their understanding of this i want this to become a an actual it's like i want you to catch this and in your own field people say oh my god is that my doctor wow he just feels like he's got something to say to me or wow that musician or wow or wow that martial art whoever whatever that the actual presence by using that form that process pattern easy inner, inner is finer it happens to show out through the heavier so it shows here it's not a belief that's not showing but i believe it in my early days i knew it existed because i was an upper finer dimensional meditator basic upper style and my question was after a while yeah but does it work meaning is it really here i knew there's a little dribble down of course it was a little dribble it was a dribble down okay when i went to japan he answered my question just seeing him my, question, just seeing him my, question was answered yes all of that exists here right here in the dojo right here right here in the dojo right here through this old man i said wow great now how do we do that okay but see that was an answer to a question because i had beautiful dimensional stuff talk about heavenly choirs all that wild up there beautiful and a little trickle down but does it really exist that's why the positioning is important the fullness of it so that your position it's here and now did i get lost i don't know why the time is going by so fast tonight i hope these were very well received you got it right hello out there i sense it's mike from new zealand yes sir i was just going to comment on um, the two the two practices that you did earlier standing that uh what was very noticeable me was that with the second one i simply walked to where i've been standing where the first one was and just entered where i'd got to at the end of the first one it was like it just happened and it was like it was like sliding into really comfortable slippers that were familiar and yeah so that became my starting ground for the second practice yeah and, i think that's what we were trying to say a while ago that i expect you people after a bit a bit to be able to go from your first set get the first set uh get all your components right and then, to a four by four you have that ability yeah okay yeah the other thing i just want to say was that one of the words that i find helpful in my practice and then talking to others is in when you're talking about easy the eye and, opening and allowing that um i use the word notice now that's not paying attention to it's just that you know in my mind i can you know thoughts come in and thoughts go out and i notice them but i don't have any attachment to them i don't suddenly zoom in on a thought and okay probably okay if you like it great myself i just want to use it because a lot of people say notice and they're going to be looking around with this upper awareness part yeah no i understand oh that's my but you your works for you hey great perfect but just understand the sometimes limitations of the human humans in the human condition you got to be a little careful sometimes because it'll take you literally let me notice easy the eye do i see anything am i noticing anything they're, very good at screwing things up anyway hello out there hi easy yes hello, out there hi easy yes hello danny here hey danny whereabouts in what we've been doing today and i missed last week's but where does the where is the domain in this i haven't thrown it out to anyone else here i don't think or have i yeah i have okay uh in the dimensional it's hard to draw okay in the dimensional but using that as heavier finer dimension finer, dimension very fine dimension, okay, but they're interior that dimensional work, okay, there's a certain level when we have untwined from the wrappings in the human condition they're tight wrappings for some people very tight thick hauser ropes okay and they're in a one by one easy next level next level uh the wrappings aren't quite as heavy they're ropes not haws or ropes they're ropes but a little bit better so they're having a fair day okay easy, easy, as you continue this internal dimensional work there's a certain level where we exit that manifest part of creation okay remember el sensei's manifest hidden divine that we could call that the manifest and as it gets finer and finer you get to move into a finer that has no wrappings that way and i call that the domain, and there the self is very much itself okay, and you're in the same creation, but again you're experiencing you're uh experiencing things that are much creation at a much finer level okay i hope i'm saying this right really much better level okay uh, there's still circle and center at that level, there's still a character when they we may talk about archetypes as something but not tonight of course i'm running out of time uh there's still a character you okay again essentially this time about aikido uh we could guess that it started to show at domain level and then it just increased increase and it was really ushiba of aikido boom, in the in the heavenly level of that so i might we might refer to the manifest at the heavier twinings as it gets finer and finer and you get out of that type package that, was tight that's a little bit finer and finer and finer as you get out of that we call that the hidden using the sensei's vernacular and i call it the domain it's a whole ah and the workings of the universal forces the creation forces are just showing much better there the self is much, clearer experiencing itself as self okay very advanced level of self that's the best i can do danny thank you very much pretty good okay again we don't have a language for a lot of this so i'll try i'll try hello out there help sensei this is lauren just a time check i believe we have 30 more minutes as if you want to go to the full time so really it's seven it's 7 30 now and we've been running oh, oh, okay it is 7 30. uh if they want to continue to hang out we have 30 more minutes that's right yes we normally continue 30 more minutes thank you for hanging in there people uh okay talk to me hello out there in tv land well i've got something sensei that you might like to comment on for me um, you and i were uh talking about um you spoke to me about a boost a booster for maybe i it might be time for a booster for healing right now for me and so i checked that out in my in, internally, and, um when i asked about it if it was possible i was told to wait and, and in the waiting it became very dark and but i became aware of a cylinder that i had to get into and, climb down climb down in this in this so-called darkness yeah but i could feel sleep, and, i don't know how long it took to climb down this steel rail but at the bottom anyway i hung out there and then after a little while i could see little like little flowers if you like and i'm really not sure what happened after that there was um just a feeling just a powerful feeling of possibility i think that's what i was yeah therefore so, um okay so the dark is that down time trick um we're in a light world but it's sort of limited for me so i say ah, potentially it could go all dark taking me to a next finer dimension minimum i could go further than that but i'll say the next finer dimension at which time i'm in a new light world that dimension i i'm in bobby i say all dark brings me to the next level it opens up it's all mixing robert oh thank god i'm not bobby anymore i'm a robber thank god i'm not a one by one anymore i'm a two by tour that's what the dark is it's a nice potential fast movement capability a travel vehicle that we used to call those a travel vehicle okay uh you're doing the slower form i'm not bitching about it whatever you want to do but slower form of getting in this device go down in the device uh get to a certain level and then feeling something uh and all i was asking you to do was just a little faster form of that interior, finer there is a self okay, and a better level of self has the ability of because it's very um energetic alive has the ability of glowing out from self as itself has a core self is a core and it glows outward with healing possibility that i thought would help it gets down bing bang, ah, that it sounded like a good time to call that one into play that level into play so if you want to take the slow scenic route that's fine i'm not bitching about that take it smell the flowers if you would but basically i was trying to say to you was hey danny dammit you're a dance when you become aware that you're advanced you have a self here go for it go for it stop fudging about i would say but do, whatever you want to do it's you doing yes do whatever you want to do me doing you i would like to add so i've done that twice and today i walked without any walking sticks for the first time for a long time and the interesting thing for me was that i started walking without even thinking about it i didn't look for my sticks it was almost like very natural so yeah i just like i think what you've been coaching me in okay i'm doing it the slow way but yeah that makes sense to me in some ways but, that, there's evidence, real, world evidence that it actually there's a working here going on, yeah, well there's evidence from the first baby step that we've done people a brat oh my gosh now what's happening in the more space because of the situation it's mixing up walker could you not see the difference did you feel the difference did you not see the difference, there it is right there the whole story is right there easy the eye okay, the forces naturally mix up a character in this case the character is walker and then a better walker and as he continues to ease the eye it just, other things come into play because it's a big creation there'll be whoa i feel like the sail and the wind is blowing me it was even easier to walk because i didn't have to walk i felt like a sail and the wind's doing all the work in a certain way it was all there the entirety virtual virtually of creation was there all right so i keep showing the limited human being levels okay and getting a little bored uh or not for you people you've been around for around for 5 10 20 40 50 or whatever you've been around come on all right so we're so we're hinting at moving faster to a better level, okay faster to a better level so that the finer assemblies of the creation we're in the potted the potted pot you're in it's just a finer pot in the finer pot that mixes up a better plant ah, that pattern goes on all the way to a very full level easy the eye so the body can function better let's show you another example here's a body under pressure ease of the eye so a body can walk under pressure better no big deal it's kindergarten stuff but it's all there, the whole thing is there now just continue that pattern okay, and you'll realize experience much of this and continue but i don't know how to say it any better help i was just going to ask sensei that in your earlier days which were obviously a good while ago now descending into the dark did it take longer or did you just find it was something that you could do easily no it took me a while a brand new serta no i can't say brand new in this life i was brand new at it i don't know my other lives of dealing with underworld uh tricks, one in descending i told you the snake story i'm just sitting, at that level snakes are biting at me okay well but i'm meditating so continue to sit open allow okay there's a snake pit oh my god easy, sit settle sit settle down time allow and then they begin to show their true colors they smile at me weren't biting anymore they were giving me that look now the game is a foot easy settle open sense of deeper and eventually got to this beautiful gorgeous goddess lady flicks and energies are spiraling up at a heavier level they were nagging on me, settle through the underworld dark they're beautiful things they're nutrients okay, so i, so i, i had nobody to ask about this i was on my own my own okay i understand danny's uh tube to go deeper i use that i use a i use a lot of times water like i was sitting on an ocean practicing going deeper okay and one trick i use because there's a little fear of going deep underwater even though you're sitting i wasn't in an ocean i was sitting but i played the game i was going deeper underwater little trick i would take it i would go into a diving bell and with the diving bell go deeper get a sense of the deeper level, looks okay looks okay and then i go at it more actual more experiential without the diving belt okay so i could relate to danny's story of using this tube to come down yeah but once you're down there's hey beautiful flowers you don't need a tube after a bit so yeah, boom to the beautiful flower place or to the self that i forgot what words danny used uh, do you remember danny that what are you saying not self assured but something you're done there with the flowers it was the feeling possibilities yeah a lot of possibilities at this level yeah level yeah you're in a much finer level energies mixed and they'll mix up a character but with some choice of character could i say you could change your lineage much better you could be the family man the patriarch, i believe you're the pa yes you are the patriarch in your family uh you can say from the patriarch to the martial arts aikido instructor to whatever, whatever, yeah so there's a lot of different possibilities at a certain level okay, and uh and uh yeah good, good enough uh, am i losing you anything here i also wanted to get a little bit more into self into self ah god not the time tonight where is it going, uh let's try this okay easy the eye okay making believe i get easy on you let's make believe as a clearer talk, okay, got the game play the game easy, the eye and it's saying now that it's been allowed to expand more you, helped it to move along by saying easy it moved along what does it have to say about itself moving along something like that [Applause] i believe i'm hearing uh oh i like the freedom, i felt kind of scrunched in around bobby of myself easy the eye self for example playing the game you're playing the game easy the eye and we unwound a bit from the tighter, and we unwound by easy, and we're saying play the game that you can hear itself, i did easy the eye like that why did it like that what does it help easy the eye do, [Applause] okay sorry gotta cut in cut in somebody easy the eye and easy the eye hello what's your sense of what it said christine from new zealand a sense of relief and, why, i, guess it's almost that um that unwinding as you described it was an unwinding and i um that sort of loosening um and probably a letting go of the body so the body almost i felt that the body started to have presence as well this is like ah okay the, equation from i taking control suddenly off a little bit in the body sort of saying hey, the paper is different than the body that's drawn on it the paper is different than the center to the circle energy forces at whatever level the paper is different and on and on the paper i don't know what to say is its own thing it's its own peace okay so as it gets more the freedom to experience itself in its freedom ah, yes, likes that likes that yeah right time for uh one of my clear experiences with self so i'm and suddenly self hovers a bit high, above the body and i'm retaining my sense of self and i'm saying and but it pulled out from the body there's a body sitting there and i myself and that was like wow so apparently that realization of the difference wasn't clear to me and about at the same time very soon thereafter i realized bodies come and go but i self am the ongoing one i'm the ancient one i'm the and eventually i was at the beginning and i'm still here okay so that was my little more advanced form of what you just said does that grab you any yeah bodies come and go but i self i still exist uh death uh after there didn't scare me too much because what the body's gonna go yeah but i'm still i still exist i'm still me whatever me i'm me self i still exist bodies come and go that's why i notice a, whole big change about the potential of dying almost getting into a real bad car wreck it was close and it would have been bad it was highway stuff uh and saying whoa and the car is spiraling around and this is fun what a kick i had fun in there if i'd fear my safety and stuff i would have whatever but i remember just being excited about it all wow what fun anyway yeah side stories uh so uh so self, said what come on something uh sensei it's justin again my, my, my what kept coming up for me was the idea the, the ideas of clear or clarity and the, ability with clarity to take definitive, impactful, um actions in the world that i'm in yeah okay hold on a moment let me jump on that word clear clarity as, as you get into a bigger piece of paper you i self you i self uh there's more clarity as to how things work, okay whether it's the lesser clarity of, seeing two okays and you kind of know where this is going to move this way no one's going to move that way to a bigger clarity of einstein a clarity of certain aspect of how the universe works in his line of business, i get to a clarity of how the universe works and the center of the circle, the center i get a pretty good clarity on it okay um so yeah clarity is, is one of the benefits of easing the eye to self because there's more clarity on how things work that's when again don't judge it so fast don't, carry an agenda because you'll interfere with what it's what it really is because you're carrying an agenda because you're catholic or, muslim or what the hell ever you are and you're carrying something it's got to be this way uh you know let it lay out the way it lays out trust you're in your own pot and it's nourishing your own plant and it'll all unfold for you because you're in your own pot in your own universe yeah and one of the aspects there is clarity that's one of my semi-majors by the way thank you somebody, playing the game that easy the eye can talk what did it like about being allowed for lack of words to be easy to have a little more room easy the eyes said why are you so shy sensei linda here um the words that are coming to me are i got this i can do this and did you pursue it with you've got what, or how you get this you see you heard those words now what are you gonna do with them i'm just trying how to be better there okay i got this but easy what do i got let it unfold a bit more i'm in the midst of a few things that could apply to so i found it very reassuring it was like oh okay almost like someone coming along you know you got this keep so far so good keep going yeah i'm just saying sometimes we're you're at a level you can uh milk the level for a little bit more okay oh this is a pleasant level yes and what else goes on here at this pleasant level, oh i'm hearing at ease is pleasant at ease and the feel of the attitude oh i'm glad i felt that because that was a nice feeling i will definitely yeah i, i don't say i milk things a bit more explore more i let it unfold more yeah, so when i first sent something i don't say okay that's it i, i sense it and i get closer to it i merge with it for like a words and let it in feeling itself whatever it's doing it's doing explain itself more i don't mind hanging for a bit see don't a lot of people want to do shionage they don't want to feel shiho nagin, you understand that oh yeah oh yeah but to feel shionage to fully feel it they don't want to do that, you're saying i'm wasting my time now we have to train fast because it's a martial art because they're afraid to settle open and feel and feel that's why they come up with all that and we have to correct it fast don't we if you're an idiot yeah, fast is okay now and then but all the time i'm thinking you're running from something you're so busy being fast i have to wonder what is it you're running from what's scaring you or young people what's scaring them because they're too fast to run right what would be there if you slowed down and felt what was happening yeah hang out with it a bit well since they like the word soap we could say muse i don't know come up with your own word you see this there's more there to be garnished, i'm not even sure what that word means but garnished harvested it's a little trick of the trade, thank you censor out of this anyway ah, god we didn't even really get to talk about self experience self but self is just a continuation of easy the eye few levels of that and, self, okay, and what i have to self-self susan, you on yes sensei say something about the beginnings of self beginning to experience itself the beginnings easy the eye to self now whoa now whoa something bit different this is shelf it's not just easy the eye it's something more and it's be like the words becoming more aware of itself it's experiencing itself now the early stages of that say something for me please don't ask me questions you know what i'm talking about with it there's, a relief of sense of self getting to express itself self being allowed to show itself there's a there's a, a relief much more than a relief um sort of ah finally self gets to really come in here and show itself yeah make itself known see i think yeah we're touching it because uh, danny heard uh somebody say a lot of possibilities here, uh, uh, yes that's good and uh yeah, the self itself has a voice it's live thing it's you a live thing this paper's alive and self is alive all right okay now don't just sit as an eye talking to self your big brother maybe we shouldn't use the word over self that might be oh the over self uh easy the eye and bigger piece of paper itself just change its names there because it's a bit bigger and it's easier for it to sense experience itself it's not just an awareness, okay we could say aware i experience experiencing i am aware it's important that we not lose that experiential factor, you circular types you intelligencia will have that tendency okay you who are prone for centering i'm going to get on your case if you don't include this the circular forces that are there that'll be your shortcoming potential well since i was guilty he said uh because he had a damn good center then, he goes to uh the gucci the gucci and he said the gucci was all over him all over him to realize hey this is really here and it's something and boom, boom okay really, got on him so to speak so you are strong centered better take in the circle you who are aware you better take in the experience, but we're using the center line to represent the feeling of it it's experiencing itself oh i know the word experience, is not the experience so i saw autumn, let me see your pretty face where are you i don't i hear your voice okay uh easier there you are okay easier to talk to when i see your face uh, yes you read the script you got a sense of the character and all of that but that's not the fullness here the next step is the character that you you've cleared for and the character starting to become a fuller character there through your open clearness again to me an actor is somebody who just knows how to clear so that the character can form okay so yeah read the script yeah, yeah, yeah but that's half max, the important half is this, because you gave it a clearness in a certain way it's kind of like a stage you gave it a clear stage for the actor to get fuller and fuller and fuller on that stage to me that's the trick of it okay, and, potentially fast uh potentially wow because you're allowing the fullness of this character if you don't know how to clear you're afraid of letting a character come through, if it's against your grain okay so again i bring up the story of the nice guy saying uh a teacher i have uh talking to an acting teacher of fame i have trouble letting a, bad guy i, can't do bad guy rules well of course because he's trying to be a nice guy learning about it and a nice guy figuring out how to be a bad he doesn't want to let a bad guy energies come up because he's, still a good guy he's in the way in the way and i try to make this very clear when i say you can't get pregnant if you're pregnant, which was a profound statement but nobody out there understands me if you've got a character here you can't easily get another character here you got it clear easy clear dark time down easy boom open up you're clear and whatever the mix is, the mix and then acting whatever it's a tough character it's tough but get the fullness of tough and in there is his history why is he tough, and they'll explain his childhood the lady asked me she was doing a script and she asked me to help her because she was running into problems with the character so i did that pattern and i think i scared this poor lady because as i was allowing this character to show through me and feeling it i was saying oh he went to that school and, he had a little trouble with that and i was going through all these details i, think it was so much uh and who was the character you know that was a really good job but i think it was so much it scared her that this character was coming alive there so to speak with all of its own history of course i'm the nuns used to hit me with their uh not rulers they had these thick leather belts of course i got tough because the nuns used to hit me every day you know all this you know all this whatever yeah, so anyway so anyway another time go ahead there's something about you know that moment of moment of what that all comes together that all coalesces that's all there on stage and it happens but it's like pure joy right it's, the presence or the self kind of experiencing itself without all those yeah clicks it clicks there's a word we use so sensei likes uh let's see positioning and consolidation it consolidates we say it consolidates into a fullness of that character but because everything's in harmony at that level click and you know you got it because you can it boom [Music], it just sort of explodes through you kind of thing i wish i'd be careful go wow and spin off double check feel it again yeah, but yeah if when things when, those two lines line up at whatever level there should be a click that you can pick up you can even physically feel it those of you in aikido have done the two person dance step thing the two step with two people you know what i'm talking about yeah when your partner and you are clicked together you can feel it whoa i just got a little ping in the heart and these are people because i've taught this uh exercise eslint in other places and they feel that click so you don't have to be an aikido person to feel this click, when two when two click together there's a click when they're proper in relationship and they meet properly click so there's a bit of when these forces at whatever level any degree of harmony there'll be a click, yes yeah okay, and to be a pro double check to click oh we're running over time jesus i'm sorry, okay and thank you sensei we are over time we are over time yeah thank you for hanging out, thank you thank you so much sensei and thank you everyone for staying thank you enjoy next week off no class next friday no class next friday the 22nd take care thanks essay

he loves those warriors he, does me too and it's just a, joy to behold when they play well and when they lose it's heartbreaking i've never been a fan before in my life you know when they won in 2015 and all of oakland went crazy happy it convinced me that actually there's a there's a role for sports in society professional spectator sports hello danny muted hello, hello, very well thank you how about yourself good, good i'm great thanks getting better and better um step backs here and there but yeah, generally i'm doing work very well thanks, it's good you look good look energetic at least through zoom filters you know yeah that, probably helps jack wada are you there jack yeah hi i'm here yeah do you have no you have two screens going one with the game and one, with this are you gonna wait oh, i'm going to keep the, sound off in the game i'll get two screens but i'm okay i've done this before all right well don't, tell us the score, no i won't say anything like that have you guys got some big game going on oh yes so it's the professional basketball tournament and we're in the finals and the local team here in the san francisco bay area is called the bay the golden state warriors, and they're in the finals and uh and uh so they're the local team and jack is a jack is a, dedicated fan for many years and has uh pulled me along with him well good luck to you and i think i think you're right yeah i know that, would sport sure lifts their spirits and people very important for somebody cam yeah hello everyone hello linda you're on the, the mesa in mesa in outside san diego is that where you are now i'm in my office i, know but i know this is the answer borrego state desert, foreign desert near the museum and visitor center all right justin did you float away with the storms in miami i, i nearly did if we had a tropical depression come through last friday and it's, rained every day and, sometimes all day since then just a little a little drizzle or did you have you know 10 inches in 10 hours or something downpours there are some parts of miami and this is typical of miami that are right now under four feet of water um i mean a week later i mean it was it was happening fast there was there were some storms that were they were dropping a foot of rain um, but there's no drainage in some places and the city is built almost at sea level, and uh it floods very quickly i'm, not in, that part of town thank, god but um god but um it's been a rough week and it's just the first week of our hurricane season right, right all amount of things to come yeah you could send some of that rain to california we certainly mean indeed yes hello everyone joining in welcome, we're still a minute or two from sensei uh logging on and i'm going to take the liberty of uh acting as uh the fundraiser here and ask everybody uh to the extent possible that you think about making contributions to nadosensei for these virtual dojos uh if you're a jews paying member of one of his dojos it's sort of included and we've not required it and we don't want to require required it and we don't want to require it but it's actually the donations especially in 2020 and 2021 really helped nado sensei and his wife make ends meet and uh because student memberships and students in the actual dojos are of course way down and so everybody has their own circumstances if you can uh, you know help then it's, very appreciated if your circumstances are such that you can't don't worry about it please you know you should continue with this practice and um i'm saying this so that nado sensei doesn't have to because our sensei shouldn't have to but somebody has to so uh forgive me for being so american about it actually not even american new yorker so and uh let's see i don't know if he's about ready in one minute is the answer so welcome autumn hello gina okay ken crown's up at lake tahoe so he's there cybernetically but i don't know if we'll hear from him right diana in florida one day you're going to have to play flute for the group okay sensei's ready to go no really here i am good evening uh-huh it's warm down here in my neighborhood okay i thought last week was really cool you impressed me we're on a roll so i didn't want to change topics because that was like major like major uh so i'd like to hang with that a bit longer, a, bit of a longer journey so we get a lot of things to do but that first uh clarification on which was a word we're using aspects which aspect is which as, we move along we will talk about the overlay factor of those two but i didn't want to talk too much about the overlay factor because we have a smearing problem uh where uh you can't tell yourself from your character and, you sort of screw both of them up a certain way so anyway let's continue with uh, from last week ah what'd you get out of that, what'd you get out of that we got all week to play with it was big time stuff what do we got that was a question by the way what you got with that well uh sensei this is justin um this, week i've been much more intentional in my practice of exploring a connection with yourself a little bit of radiant self and, touching more on that on a regular basis rather than what i usually do which is uh settle open ground so i can as a as a being get a clearer sense of the situation and the energies this week although there were many changing situations as there always are despite the fact that a lot of hats were being changed in the midst of all of that, a sense of core or centeredness self a stillness was there as the situations were moving around me then that was a felt like it's this different point of view that i was engaging with the world from it was a subtle difference um i wasn't as i don't caught up by the, busyness of changing situations i was a little more core centered with a presence a beingness there slight but core radiant little different than it was in the past weeks for me okay so what i heard him say was yes there's still a character in his world and things are going on but he highlighted and gave more time this last week to the self there's a self here and he was playing with that a bit more than he would let's say normally do uh so yeah, uh, should, be so times to emphasize a character run and times to emphasize the self run could we call it so yeah somebody how did you do what'd you play with what guy didn't say crystal from new zealand chris um i truly loved the experience that we did last week about not sort of creating the character letting that, that process sort of still like go into the space so i've been playing a lot when with that transition or experiencing the, not the character but that same energy and resources shifting towards the self-space and that emerging of togetherness with self with self and experiencing trying to experience that space um which for me felt um, well i haven't been there well this week so for me it was a healing in myself um a resource and um, a glowing energy when i needed to be a have a bit more energy but it just didn't sort of form up it was just the moulding of emerging of what would be character and that self-space, which i truly really enjoy so that was one whenever you're going to play with both of them together you ought to be clear you're doing that because of the smudging problem yeah okay [Music] whatever self already exists but in the, this, creation trap that we spiraled into okay that wasn't totally meant to happen but there it is we did it okay and so one form uh i use in my own sense is a uh, whatever you call that brad give me a word here uh, funnel, funnel and in creation it goes into heavier and heavier and heavier okay so i kind of like that one sometimes to just have a sense of things although it's kind of linear but anyway bear with me uh and i get too tight okay and i've been there before bit of crazy do something do something to start to work, up the line where there's more room okay, easy and there's certain tricks of settling opening whatever you're using to move dimensionally through so i sometimes like that diagram it's a simple one it's very tight and, and there's much more opening and much more opening and much more opening okay, the characters caught up in that the world he's in gets caught up in that zoom, uh this uh this self gets caught up in that becomes an eye, okay, so that sense of it uh the one i've always kind of like although it's a bit too linear too linear the same story is this overlay i'm in a certain level we could call it a one by one or there is a one by one potential and a half and a half potential uh but easy do a little practice game of shifting eventually continuing that game i shift to a three by three so uh, the here and now of it so i, like this sense of things this zoom but i don't know if i care for the linear sense it's like i'm a human being here and god is way back there someplace kind of thing uh the overlay is a little bit better uh so what whatever i'm just bullshitting here to kill time people that's all i'm doing uh so again the major last week and i want to continue with the sense of it there's self and there's character two aspects were i'm calling it two aspects, they're both important they're both in relationship but careful too first with shmuro let's get a little clearer on this one and then that one and then we'll see how they overlay and how they i don't know words relate to each other okay, uh, position, uh, very important uh and again when we talk about when they come together but work to together the positioning the positioning of the self, uh, here's that little circular line there the self in relation to his person his character okay is very important because again i think i mentioned it before we're seeing cells all over the place okay, i roam around in the domain of cells and uh a lot of them don't know they're supposed to be proper with their character so we have hoverers a lot of overs a couple of you mentioned your stand by the ciders the ciders somebody mentioned they were back there a bit uh so cells are potentially all over the place so i'm asking selves to come in, relation to their character and position their better so that eventually where i'm heading with that is the glow of self position better or radiate out through the multi levels of the character the energy body character for example and the physical body character and into the situations he's in our world he's in okay so i think that positioning is very important okay a sense of being spiritual i've got to go up there and float around i'm no, no, we're not going there here inner finer in relation to the character in alignment with the character positioned better with the character and again i think i mentioned that's the work me and susan are majoring in she has ill people a variety of things they send her some weird cases not just physical therapy some weird cases and uh so one thing we do is make contact with their self and see from the self's viewpoint what the problem is and in a lot of cases the cells aren't quite in alignment they're hovering or whatever and so we're practicing dialoguing with them and asking them to position and see what their fears are for not positioning what their misunderstandings are uh stuff like that so we'll eventually get into that more, starting to get a little more advanced but i'd like you to have the sense of self is here self glows we like that word this week i think it glows you want to say radiate screw you say radiate i don't care that much i happen to like the word glows okay you want to say self emanates hey i'm fine find your own word i like glow okay and, inner finer is a finer level of glow of self, okay so just because you are aware there's a self hey that's cool that's a good move to have any sense of a glow from self which a lot of you brought up last week i thought whoa they're getting it i was very pleased even a little surprise okay and there's more there's a deeper glow a stronger glow of a fuller glow from the self the self okay so we want to continue with that for a bit you talk i'm getting tired here heat exhaustion somebody what are you catching on to here, uh sensei this bob um i think one thing that came through last week that made the class so successful was uh i think this was partly a transmission from your own experience a deeper experience itself and its glow than we have had before and among other things that makes it a little easier to differentiate between self and character yeah, yeah it should be after a bit pretty distinctive it has its own although again as we get finer and finer there might be some similarities whatever but if we early in the game get a sense of oh this is character and his desires and how he functions and now i'm going to meditate easy all of that i'm going for self letting self easy so self can be more present make itself known as you continue some, many of you are picking up the glow of self yes cool let's continue so uh, yeah, is that, okay what i said okay, i like that some of you are picking up qualities uh nancy i was very impressed with uh nancy what was the word you use i, don't remember nancy just waiting for her to open up her phone unmute yes it was a sense of generosity and benevolence that seemed to never be sad that's the word i was talking a couple of people that i don't know if we're using the right word it was around in there but benevolence yes and that's very nice because you're getting, uh, going here you're getting to the earlier uh earlier the earlier finer of your qualities and it's very important uh we have to go quite a bit we'll we will go quite a distance with that because there's a more origin of those qualities there's more than one okay maybe a couple of tricks of the trade which i'll bring up along the way but for example because itself glows or emanates it, has a what can we say it's a type of power which can push okay so you pick up a quality and knowing it has a type of power that can push a bit don't run out crazy with your benevolence okay maybe don't sell your house and give all the money to the street people being benevolent you know maybe, you've gone too far you know uh, and, because there's more than one enjoy the hell out of them soaking in benevolence but also be open for and what else try to get a better balance there seems to be one quality especially when there's a push starts to spin okay all right and i've tried to explain that in the past in nado language you get strong feeling oh love and you scored a delivery boy and, and, whoever comes by the mailman your, sense of love is starting to get off you got spiraled out a bit okay so that's not those way of presenting things bear with me if you don't like it move on screw you, okay you all right here so far so uh i think early in the game try to get a balance for example enjoy the hell out of benevolence and the flavor the soaking in benevolence okay that's cool that's really cool and you might be open soon for its first partner see what else is there that is a partner to benevolence and, we're going to continue that pattern as we go finer and finer and finer, okay i like the number fours as a reference you okay with me nancy so far she leave she's here sensei yeah anyway thank you i, like the word and i like your sense of it who else somebody else cut me up i forget who i talked to somebody on the phone and they were talking about uh moving along with cell finder and firefighter and they're coming up with a couple of few qualities yes that's, what happened uh so don't get confused also will help you because you'll, be enjoying benevolence or whatever and suddenly there'll be another one they go oh did i make a mistake did i make up that one and this one is the true one or, is this the false one and because it's not the first one and all right little trick of the trade there's more than one okay and when this next one shows yeah, and, allow it or facilitate allowing it whatever the right words are and we're not finished yet but cool it too it's pretty cool uh i'm, tired of talking somebody what are you getting out of this hi sensei it's dusty i have a question if that's okay um well i like what we're here for yeah well i like first i mean i like that it feels like, constant or some focus on the self take some pressure off of the uh character which i like, the characters a little more free to do its thing but then like does who's, when you talk about a trade of the self and qualities of itself like who's saying those like so it's in self-territory it's a self-self-sassing self i don't know how to say it self's territory, i, don't know at the moment i'm not going to answer your question right but who said that i got to figure out who said that so i bobby can control this game who said that i gotta know don't gotta know easy you have a sense of something so be it there it is easy, who's talking i don't know but it's not my normal easy okay so i sort of won't add to that right now uh but i, i, think i understand the quandary i've heard it before but i don't think i want to get into it because i probably can't say it clear or properly, uh anyway uh be careful dusty of smudging though okay just be careful uh, easy, no it depends what lineage you're on easy if you're easy for the eye yes the now you can major in easy the eye and not have a character be there pass on the character okay you want to continue you're meditating you're not going to jump up and play tennis yeah okay so when you meditate just a word i use for the i major self, major part uh you continue with that for as long as you're meditating an hour, two hours three hours for whatever so you don't have to check out the physical now wrong to at a certain place along the way to check but don't you schmear you're not so fast doing that you'll smear it yeah, yeah wait a while yeah when you're on self beyond self when you're on character beyond character, and know what lineage character are you a tennis player are you a school teacher are you a, the lover of the week uh what, lineage is the character on okay so be clear yeah i like it thank you clarity is important uh don't, i don't know what be all over the place go somebody this layout oh that yes danny go yeah it looks hot there first of all um yeah first of all i, i note that um, when we do this work with you this is how it is for me it's really quite powerful it, feels stronger and more direct than say when i sit on my so it's um it's um over, here, whatever you i first thought of um zooming a dojo it's really um so i'm sorry to interrupt daddy continually amazed at the transferring that goes on so danny i'm sorry to interrupt i'm breaking out am i yes you're breaking up can you turn off your camera please and just use audio and now please start again sorry thanks yeah i was i was saying how um it's like when, you're leading us through these um levels how, powerful it is when it when there's a collective that's how it is for me yeah and um just a quick site that's a whole pattern i'll bring that up after a minute sorry danny go yeah and, um, yeah i noted that um i, saw all the lots of myself queuing up queuing up it was like they all wanted to have a chat with me and so um i like that idea of the funnel it seemed appropriate but they all wanted to come along for the ride somehow um okay danny yeah how can i position yourself within danny the person character okay who could use some health flow from the self if you have many cells how am i going to position you i don't understand many selves here uh it's like i notice for instance i might be in the healing self and now i know that then there's a another self that wants to have a conversation and, then there's more behind that i just feel themselves wanting a piece of the action if you like, okay, do whatever you want myself, i wouldn't separate them out into pieces the glow of self has a lot of healing potential in it within the glowing self there are qualities more than one within the glowing self is a certain amount intelligence about you the character or it itself uh okay like you may say hey i've been around a long time bodies come and go but i'm, an ongoer i'm, still here okay, uh, anyway, so if you want to continue with different selves feel free i don't care for it but do whatever you want to do gotta do okay no, um i no, um i i'm, um i'm, um it's not really what i really want to do it was just something that i noted was going on and when you mentioned the funnel it made it made a lot of sense to me and furthermore during for my week and i had quite a few health challenges just this week and i found that i was incredibly um delicate with myself in, my demands on, on how i should get better and, a really um a lovely connection with um center and circle um, yeah so i've had a pretty good week overall, with the with the um my inner world and it, certainly um shows up in my outer world for sure and again for people don't worry about how much of it shows up for a while when you're majoring in self uh, yes we expect there to be some changes and as it gets more advanced and more advanced and more advanced some pretty fancy things but don't worry about that now because there'll be tenants they may be coming out and seeing if things are changing if they don't change oh i must be screwing up because you've got a flat tire or you got fired or whatever so don't be too fast to get out into the uh spiral of life uh just keep you we'll see we'll see okay i don't know oh the word trust comes up again trust that itself seems to be something trusted itself trust the trust the more of it the finer of it the better glow of it and whatever the more of it just, trust that it will unfold itself more and more uh so i just don't want you to see if it's working don't be a little kid what's the joke pulling up the new carrot to see if it's growing and he does it every day the carrot ain't going to grow so don't be a little kids on same people okay and this will be more important i have my own patcher why do i need another one oh thank you anyway okay somebody thank you danny i have a question this is nancy okay nancy go for it um what's the role of chance you know in all of this like you know no matter how much i prepare or you know everything's i've tried to make it all right but then there's always something that happens and i have to be ready for something brand new unexpected all the time and it seems like a feature of the universe but i don't know if it's part of the self or the character or this role of evolution everything's kind of a roll of the dice all the time and you know sensei talks about you know are you saying are you saying life is screwed up yes, fine yes it is now what can we do about it is that a character is that a creation i don't i don't know what, what to call that i don't know let's go over some basics so there you are let's say to some degree centered okay it's just use that as a reference we're talking character now okay person, yes nancy yes nancy yes got it now something in your world begins to change okay there's a knock on your door it's uh your cousins from out of state who unexpectedly are visiting you unexpectedly the change therefore you the centered one has to change, to be whatever you're going to be in dealing with your cousins okay got it got it so as far as the character is concerned that's going on quite frequently uh you don't have to perfect it perfect it let me see what to say here you do aikido nancy yeah it's kind of like i expected you know i just i'm not sure what to what to call this part of the world it seems like it's good to expect that things will change and evolve and be different all the time and that's part of the reason we train yeah but i want to be looking around for things changing you're not here, with a sense of here but a sense of open to changes without looking around for changes okay, okay, if you're suddenly an attacker comes at me i hope because of the law because i'm present that circumstance is changing my center and i go hey and i do the best i can, thank you thank you that's very helpful that center the circle, the center thank you yeah now down the line you might get see if i want to bring this up pushed by the self excuse, me the self the self the self could be a nag, okay the self could be a nag possibly i can't prove this but possibility when i was working in a factory inspector physically get weird now i'm kind of a jock, i'm not used to getting weird heartbeat or dizzy possibly we could say that was the self saying hey what are you doing in the factory oh get out of here okay you gotta move along okay i like the factory a certain way because it's easy repetitive paycheck wasn't bad for a young kid uh but it wasn't my thing okay so i was pressured uh it could have been pressured from uh a robert pressuring bobby or it could have been the self starting to nag that yes okay yeah yes thank you thank you oh sensei said no one knew but he was under pressure well i think he said all the time his self he was so potentially could go further and further that his self was kind of a nag great more hey you can do better fantastic you're not finished yet so uh we'll catch the language of the self and we'll play with how to recognize a push a push from the self it must have a little different tonality or sense to it than uh, a character wanting to be a better character we'll work that out and play with it when one day that'd be kind of fun thank you yeah hope to help yes, it helps it helps and worst comes the worst you sit down and watch a dumb movie on tv square one take up drinking you know anyway, ah, so, uh, again the main there are two aspects self and the character and don't mind majoring in one i, liked what i did i didn't do it purposefully but in retrospect i was like wow i did a good job with that i'd have my on the mat training time okay i trained hard trained well i'd go home in the afternoon it's kind of free of free i'd go home and in the afternoon i would do finer energy character body practices energy flowing practices deeper centering practices trying to get into other dimensions of the character okay at night time meditation time okay, whenever it was 10 30 whatever sit on the couch meditation time self time self time so it was kind of distinct but i kind of in retrospect like the way i did that i could, advance in different parts kind of properly okay uh yeah i don't know if i said it great but anyway in retrospect i like that i did it that way it ah hello out there in the world you said you were gonna come back to that, something nominationed about i'm sorry danny you're fading daddy then you're fading on us okay it's going into slow motion and your voice is fading and sensei i'll follow up with danny by a text and please just yeah okay, just yeah just yeah okay everybody easy okay i kind of start with easy the eye because often but after a bit just easy settle, here, easy the sense of as i settle some vague sense of moving into a little bit bigger realm feels a little airier a little freer easy and then doing that it started to run my mind again because there's more energy more juice in the neck so i get close to the necks and it may push me okay prior for the course no problem easy with a sense of a little more opening easy we're just going for a little more room space i haven't decided which uh aspect i'm gonna work we're gonna go for itself but uh but when i'm just settling down i may not have decided yet or i'm not sure which one is once a turn or needs a turn easy, certainly the sense of this circle around me my words the circle, around me my words the circle airiness around me feels a little more distinct, so it feels like a noticeable something not great words people but you got the sense of noticeable something is that all right easy sense of opening without going heavy into the we're moving into the next dimension okay we're either moving up the line a notch or we're moving from one tighter circle to a more open circle, to a more open circle here and now, self easy, so, some vague sense that there's a self here or present or will show itself whatever is self inner, self okay now not an idea so don't be up there running around here inner, self-easy, self play with me in the early beginnings any sense of something being there it doesn't have to be distinct or really a strong glow let's start earlier any something that we call self, as, being here being here in the early, stages you can't prove it we're at that level you can't prove it but a sense a sense of something anybody, got anything to say here what's your first, sense of something that's there that you can't prove you may even doubt yourself maybe i made that up right in the beginning just seems to be a, like a small hum a light hum okay maybe i just people file away that also the vibrations of the character can move and hum so maybe i don't know see again i, think related to the distinction i wanted to make between the aliveness of the character and his system, and the glow of self so, hums at first to me i place more in the energy movement that makes up the character in this world okay but i'm not sure where you're at with it so just something will clarify after a bit and suddenly easy open the early stages of self that you can't prove you're not sure, but there's a little something what in your case what, slow returning to are you returning like um a familiarity there's something there that sort of warms you welcomes you there's a, draw okay friendly is probably a better a better word because uh familiar i could have a memory of it i did it yesterday and i remember how it was and therefore i know and i remember uh so i know it's a dumb change of words people but this is me and i understand comfortableness this there's something nice comfortable uh maybe a sense of oh i'm approaching home if tom's on uh tom that could be the approach to that level that you call home okay uh somebody is not here this evening sensei huh, tom is absolutely fine we don't need anything from tom but just anyone else on the early stages easy where self is there but almost imperceptible you're not sure you may be making it up let's say linda esken here go linda this is definitely a not sure but a sense of spaciousness or like containment hard to hard to explain that but like a sense of containing what i'm okay anyway it's not an accident that we drew it this way it's sort of contained it's a certain size and it's contained maybe so they're very easy it is the container yeah okay and maybe it's like oh here is the space and in this space self is here we say at that at that size but we'll just continue it'll clarify eventually it's going to hit you over the head so to speak but i just want you to sort of catch the potential early presence of it that's all we're doing so you get a little faster with this better at it you can move along easier self could be potentially really a fast form really a fast form uh, we did something similar some many months back i put you in a wind tunnel game and i said here's the beginnings of an energy pushing through this wind tunnel but i want you to pick up the first soft pressure, to recognize when you're being pushed by energies a lot of people don't notice and then they get pushed some more and they don't notice and they can push more and they're starting to get pissed off or off balance or whatever and it didn't this had been going on for 15 minutes idiot where were you they weren't sensitive to the first bing, bing okay so kind of like in relation to that to, pick up the sense of self or self's early beginnings that might facilitate later where you go oh self is here boom are you really open and go full bore with them it ah, thank you linda and again you're not sure doesn't matter you continue let's continue settle easy open self, self [Music] as there's more room so to speak more of self can chill okay, that's the, law the pattern okay somebody oh let's move along okay so early stages that are potentially not perceived at first easy let's continue settling and opening easy we're moving up the line here or we're moving into the next better okay [Music], self for me and the words i felt almost like a presence, and felt like that oh my gosh something no big deal that's me at this moment settle opening self again a reminder do it in relation to your body i'm doing it in relation to my position here self, okay i want to float around going around looking for self that's an old style bring up that one day in the future maybe that's a little sensate's pattern of here and now that's why i was impressed last week uh i thought you're doing pretty well at this i said oh my god they have a shop for the straight away oh sensei type whoa, fancy, who would have thought now as self begins to reflect a word show itself more be more present where you sort of don't have a question anymore i actually feel something you know the words a little thicker a little fuller and kind of sense feel it it's not a body thing it's not a character thing it says boom, something something's here it's almost tangible, lossy words somebody we're at that stage easy open so as we open as we open the more of self can show where are you now, playing this game with me where are you now itself one at a time yes yeah i felt like almost like one of those mosquito zappers, that goes that goes bringing the mosquitoes in and zapping them but instead like electrical pulses kind of shooting outward and some ventilation in their air [Music], again we're using energy words character words i think i'm hearing that oh energy went up and shot around center circle energies of the character self, is not the character self itself self is the paper the drawing of character is drawn on the character is alive i try to distinguish the words i know they're perfect but it's alive it hums itself, itself we don't use the word alive you could but i use the word oh it glows just to help distinguish so i don't smear the two and get confused, okay so maybe you were on it but from my vantage point i'd say self, itself, okay somebody moving along with self, presence i have this sense of, a field a presence available, uh a field uh a field uh like a body of its own a field of that has a texture and a more distinct clarity, with a with a here and now or present and available more of a hereness noun-ness, that's uh is almost tangible the field glow if you will but it has a texture to it yeah okay yeah so i asked brad last week how he did with this one and he said his self efforts are showing like textures of paper so uh the beginning of self being present showing itself uh felt like a inexpensive paper as he continued with easy and open the next finer of self felt like a finer grade paper and then he had a third finer grade paper i thought oh that was cool that's cute so it fits and although you didn't use the word paper your field and his paper oh yeah, cool okay and you inferred it was getting better somehow i forgot what word you use but self is itself experiencing itself aware of itself okay so uh again let's not float up because we'll be more awareness of it and we'll, be more awareness of it and we'll miss so much in the long, run it'll be to screw up self experiences itself is aware of itself okay you wanna we lost that word experience early in the creation game and it's been a major too much of a major on awareness uh, nothing helping so the actual experience, experience, so again no sense i was trying to show that he was saying you know like having this experience you can see how it manifests for example it wasn't i believe we would have ran his ass over i guarantee it i guarantee it i guarantee it he would have been an old man on the mat we would have ran his ass over but this thing was active because it was experienced right so i'd like to uh, spend a little time with is there a fear by people of their own self, i'd like to fine-tune that and see what, begins to, show okay, so, i'm not saying danny's doing this but there's a potential for oh that's too much for me or that scares me too much i'm going to do this form here, which is safer but it makes me sound like i'm bad-mouthing them and i'm getting lost in whatever my gibberish is at the moment uh was there a second question there i don't i don't know that there's a second question i've asked him for follow-up but he hasn't written back i, mean i think he's talking about i think i don't mean to put words in danny's mouth i think he's talking about sometimes, you need the help of others your, your spouse doctor hey, hey, i got no problem here why are you telling me this i got a doctor i got a wife, i do i do sometimes this joke i saw where the wife said, if it wasn't for me my husband would still be lost in ikea i fit that category man oh yeah, yeah don't bother me with it it's not my interest it's not my theme, okay, i'm not going to send out prayer cards to you and you send prayer cards back to me it's not my thing if it's your thing go ye and do it i, just want to be clear that i don't believe danny is saying that that's his thing i'm not i'm not on danny people have to understand how i talk i'm talking about a situation i'm talking, about a situation i'm talking about mankind or people kind i'm not talking to danny you gotta understand how i talk okay, if you say something to me and i go ah doesn't mean my oh is that you it's the energy that i get in my expression of them it doesn't mean i'm gonna you, if i'm gonna do that you'll know it because i'll be all over you okay or in the old days i would be up getting nicer now but anyway did you laugh brad no, i thought i heard a smirk back there, uh anyway let's move on let's move on ah, we got lost here self, now last week people talking about the glow of self so let's see if we're close enough to that easy, easy inner self easy, self, certain level don't know the right word level, where, self gets to show itself more clearly fully, [Applause], and in some way my words it glows in my words there's a sense of a yellow a yellow a yellow radiation but not different beams just a, yellow glow easy self, easy self present possibly there i might be hearing a hum i'm not sure double check your position with it don't go up into the upper floating around here stuff at the third level just made that up of, self hopefully for all of you self's present was much clearer i brought up the word glow anything in that area or whatever more of self should be showing you did very good last week let's hear about it now itself somebody uh sensei uh i got bob noah first i didn't catch you a second ago bob that fuller glow of self is distinctly different, than, the energies that makes a character it has a certain kind of steadiness to it or it or sort of internally generated that's not the right word but it's distinctly different, not bad yet it has its own generative powers could we say yes that's a better way to say yes and we'll get into that one day because hanging out with cells i find a lot of them don't know how to generate to keep improving ourselves so we'll go into that like one day so it's an ongoing trip people uh self is not just to go oh i touch self that's it that's the end of the journey i've arrived it's ongoing and there's more to come okay, but to catch itself and to be clear on it's a distinct unit compared to the character in his realm world situation uh very good very good and to have the ability of continuing of doing a major run you know 10 minutes of yourself an hour of just self whatever you want okay, and was that it bob yes yeah yes yeah and a self made say that about itself you said something like constant you not the word you use maybe but yes that's right yeah, when i heard my earlier stages i heard something like that uh where it inferred that the bobby's characters come and go i'm constant okay so it's a it's, fully there i'm just opening don't know the word opening to the more of it that's already there remember i got spun into this lobster trap that we're in called normal creation manifest world okay i'm unwinding okay and part of that unwinding is either the character getting better unwinding and then the self that's there as the character unwinds better more room for the self to unwind so they can work and tan them but again let's not smear them right now okay i'm on a self run right now okay somebody, tried to come in when noah came in somebody what yeah it was it was mark here again um it seems it seems the, energy seems cleaner it seems cleaner it it's just and the finer and you continue it may even show more cleaner the words may change there it's clear it's clear cleaner than clean or clearer than clear or something yeah somebody's self, this is nancy and you again yes um let's see i'm getting a really deep super deep silence that feels very rich and it as you say it's kind of growing and getting richer and more i don't know just supportive deep silence i like that i'm just literally people who misunderstand your how you use the word silence i'm just uh but i like your word richness, yeah it's a pretty uh three-dimensional experience i mean it's not just a auditory thing again very important to experience these things remember too many folks have a an awareness major that's fine but that's only like half now it's the experience of that so experience the whatever so richness let's stay with that for a moment richness would you put that in the same category as your benevolence as one thing riches as another thing is that a major quality do you do you think you sense your flavor it's one i've had before when we were doing self work yes yeah just a super deep, deep rich supportive silence that kind of keeps growing and growing you can almost touch it and yeah and again remember the important trick very soon now is more experience of it not just looking at it not just hearing it not just being aware of it but the it's like words it's feeling itself and it can be that experiential, very important very important very important this is an experience i was having difficulty finding words oh yeah yes definitely words are we do the best we can uh, uh are we enough time people anything at this level of self the for many of us the glowing level so it's a war huh well for me chris new zealand sorry the like a warmth to something much larger it's certainly the beginning it's a warmth that is a source there's an awareness of the source yeah and more advanced development it may have, be like a sun s-u-n and continue yeah uh somebody was trying to jump in is that florida lauren somebody in line uh, no i think that was just nancy and chris that tried to get in on top of each other so yeah bob again this level of self when you talk about positioning i believe that my capability of self the position is better here than it was at lesser levels yes and maybe also because that we've been settling and opening so we're getting a little more of the underside of things that the hoverers aware types don't have as just settle in open and settle over hopefully going through that the, deeper of things yes yeah yes yeah uh so yeah could be following that track easy, yeah, a one warning for people the sense of size could show an immense uh but again i suggest uh you can be aware of the immensity of it you know fine but if you get caught up in the immensity and you spread out it's sort of, oh since i said dissipates okay and he said to me it'll show bigger but better you trade that word in i'm paraphrasing now to the word, finer just hear finer so here a finer, just hear finer so here a finer level of self here so whatever you're here wants to be in the early stages i like this size of here a little more advanced i'd like it to radiate out i don't know 10 feet around that seems to and there'll be a tendency to float into awareness by doing that also and you lose the experience all along the way that's critical, i don't know if i said that right but anyway just a heads up warning you'll hear it again in the future i'm sure people say something because we're approaching the end nobody with a self oh you poor people who don't have a self poor you my, sense my sense of self did change at first for me it's a it's a radiant center, uh center point almost but then at the next level it's a fuller core fuller more radiant not just point but a core, with a fullness and a texture again to it that's not faint but it's a full bodied in a in a way that's distinctly different than it was at it's earlier and who knows in the final, stages the heavenly state would have not happened, the heavenly stages uh the whole thing may be a core so that's why earlier core work was potentially helpful if you didn't get stopped along the way the core continues and finer, core continues and, more original core continuously might show that way or happen that way we'll see want to get too far ahead okay, uh somebody before we finish up come on and say i, really just saw on here i really liked um the sense of richness i, connected with that and i was there's a sense of um uh, like gold there's genuine and there's impure but that sense of genuineness um you know it's the real authentic piece it's, it's uh if it says of itself i am genuine if it's speaking of itself and you sense that sense experienced that then so yes, period boom yep, great yep i like that yeah, it could be saying to people are involved, in dumb sort of way hey that's interesting stuff but some of it's i'm true i'm constant okay kind of thing maybe just pointing out who's who here in this creation game yeah i, think that's really that's uh that's, a lot of the home practice that's, a lot of the home practice that's the playing around that you talk about a lot i think it's a sense of uh knowing where you're at knowing where you're at knowing where you stand how many clicks away oh i'm a mapper it's nice i have a map okay so you kind of know i mean i mean if you're going to san francisco you don't want to get off the train in san mateo bear with me here you want to sort of know where you are you want to take a break but you like taking a break in san francisco, fine, but you know where you are okay, uh so i'm, a mapper yeah, that's great i like that that's good thank you very much sensei i certainly have to remind myself as i'm aware and then i can map it out that i double check my experience of what i'm aware of and my experience of what i'm mapping out okay so i don't fall into that trap of i'm a mapper but i've never been there but i can draw nice maps about it i can tell you about it but i've never experienced it i think

cube from bob that he's ready to go thanks for being here looks like we're just about there okay welcome to the virtual dojo robert the dos sensei teaching class bob is ready to go thank you all for coming we appreciate having you here and bob thank you so much for being here sure i had nothing better to do afraid of that okay we're on ah out of sorts balance we'll get into that after, a couple of minutes so uh let's chit chat for any late comers to pop in anything up last week any carryovers problems questions insights i cannot last you, know [Music] bob you're going to say something say it for god's sakes hi sensei uh i like the focus that you had last time on self and how the pathway from first to easy with the eye and then some space and then more and eventually you get to sell yeah and we we've been there before was it six months ago or so we were talking to a quote and over self and again i don't like that word anymore uh because i like to have the alignment the positioning better and over self tends to put it up around kind of thing so i probably won't use that word anymore, uh, uh yeah so easy the eye which, again it's the uh self the eye selfie kind of an elusive piece so knowing that we started with easy the eye, i know that's not the eye is not tangible, okay so we use this, sense of just area room easy this area rule easy the eye and there should be some sense of oh that feels a little bit bigger deeper bigger meaning a little more around easy the eye okay and then eventually the self that it's directly in relation to it's, i is a small piece of the big paper a bigger opening we call self and then we continue with a more original self a finer self whatever, make up your own words but we use some pattern like that then eventually there's a very original doubt we're heading towards a much bigger piece of the paper with that uh but along the way the self can begin to sort of make itself known better it has a, flavor itself a, texture itself uh so it's very elusive with ease of the eye and just this airy space but as we continue with that the self ought to make itself more known remember six months ago whenever we were talking to quote over uh there was a sense of a presence it was talking back to you uh you were all jumping and saying things uh so it wasn't so elusive at that level okay so, sophie bob and are you okay with that is that all right sensei shawn here hey sean there um i think, that the sense of um the finer and finer sense of self starts to starts to feel like it's in natural communication with everything around like the even the elements there's a sense of um, uh a give and take there's a rapport going on, it's just a natural part of that sense of self uh and i'll just change it a little bit yeah very close there uh easy the eye self the energies that are moving the nutrients that are moving the center circle, center uh they're communicating back and forth and then for easier we can what's, the word, be more aware experientially of their communication we can sense feel their movement their communication as far as nutrients go it's like you can assimilate them you can take them in and as far as communication goes it's like there's you start to notice that there's, you start to notice that there's there is communication coming through from all, levels yeah, we'll, do some finer work on that one day hopefully soon but yeah i think we're in the ballpark [Applause] there anybody how you doing what's up hi cincinnati chris here from new zealand chris the um i really enjoyed the, last session we talked about um uh a bit of discussion about how the, tendency to have that eye of the self above the head in the head instead of working it down below i've been working, it down below i've been working a lot with that this week um which led to a pretty, um, i guess i guess surreal sort of a keto session on a thursday night which um it left me while i wasn't left i had a nice experience of i guess balance it was openness i felt different in the body um not so much communication but more just don't overthink it so the, the class i was taking the class was less talk and more just well you just watch and experience for me so it was um and that was merely taking that experience in that self more in the body lower that deeper that deeper half which was very complete for me yeah, we want to as i mentioned before a very important piece is this here and now positioning here and now going finer you call i call it dimensional finer uh but the positioning uh because i've been uh having dialogues with self not you people it's a whole different realm there itself and a lot of them uh, aren't positioned very well we have a lot of overs i think i mentioned uh, we have some self that are over here to the side uh we have some selves that sort of don't want to be here and they're back a little ways one young girl was checking out with susan was back aways and in a cave we, called it because her family life wasn't too cool she didn't really want to fully be here so she was hiding out back here i mentioned uh a dramatic one when i first uh was working this and there was a very sick kid with some disease guaranteed to die, soon kind of thing and i said to his parents can i work with the kid just for my experience and they said sure whatever because he ain't going anywhere you know and his self was way to hell and gone i said hey self if you come in, line better with the kid there's some chance of healing or something he said hell no i, ain't coming down into that there was a feeling like the kid had crash landed where he was birthing and so i, felt like it was a, totaled car and we're asking the owner of the total car to take possession of the car the car and the owner says hell no i don't want that car so he was way back and ain't no way he was going to come in and play uh i mentioned to the people who are into the healing i think it's very important if we get this any level of self present in that good lineup that there is um set up for someone somebody cutting me off uh that, that can aid in the healing with this sense itself is accessing or has its own juice and it can radiate through uh, through the body and, run in the world you're, in so for healing to have a any level of inner self and that self come up with your own word radiating it's aliveness come up with your own word for oil and in there there's a possibility for healing okay uh so again if the self is off to the side or hovering around it's not positioning well enough to take full advantage of its juice it appears like and i'm getting a fair amount of practice uh with itself there and uh seeing and, dealing with their sense of things their misunderstandings uh so even certain level cells have misunderstandings okay uh until you get finer and finer and find yourself then they get really, sharp but until that time anyway can i ask another question in regards to that, with the position of that self with is it the same as the vintage game the more you sort of align the more you align the touch can i ask that will the self sort of permanently shift like i always have this awareness above my head but this occasion it was more because i focus more that lower under half as it gets more present it will take into account the, under half of things also and it'll be more uh so when i play with self positioning better i'm getting more and more lower or it's, kicking in more lower and in here not just it's lower down there not, that kind of thing nor is it up there nor that over there that's fuller it's fuller and in its fullness says hey i'm bigger than that i'm deeper and i'm, bigger for lack of words uh so in its positioning it'll, uh hopefully find its own ground don't know the word there so, yeah anything deeper you're on the right track deeper here it's here it's here it's here yeah but it may show deeper here it may show uh that it's finer level of self here so basic here okay uh you're on track if you want to change the not methodology but the words core physical core is here now the core is recognized and activated it activates the body gets better you continue there's a finer core here now it may appear a little bit lower there's a finer core here now we're getting into a tai chi format oh the arms can move very freely let's continue easy here there's a finer core inner finer dimension the core there and now the, legs are affected by it because it's more fully here and the legs get freer on kicking and stuff and then you get a little bit better where you've got both legs and hands and the whole system so you could follow a, core format or a chinese tai chi format but continue, continue, continue okay so we can change the words and i don't know what to say different formats or also tracking we're still tracking still tracking if i use a center and i continue centering height and depth and depth and height i get a better center things are a bit better, if i continue centering see a lot of people center a bit and then they stop because they feel pretty good so they stop or they're better than everyone else in town they stop but if you're going to continue keep searching so searching keep doing the work uh, the centers in the universe enormous there's an original center okay so the little bit of benefit we get from this is just that come on it's like whoa look at you're a bit better centered how much better things are wow why stop there and people will okay because that's all they wanted they wanted to feel better leave me alone now they don't want to do anymore or they're better than everyone else they must be great i've got the best center in town i must i must have it all i understand everything about center they stop okay, so uh a researcher a continuer uh guys like o'sensei go the distance through a lot of travail okay, a lot of pressures and he worked it out he worked it out he kept going he kept going he kept going i feel lazy compared to him does that help anyway thank you sensei yep, the word pioneer or inventor seems to come to mind because like, as much as ocean sensei was an inspiration he you, still have to go through the work you can't you can't ride on his coattails oh you no on his hotel hell no hell no hell no, and then he laid out why, he was he was in his own way kind of a mapper also i consider myself a mapper he laid out a pattern but you in your system follow the pattern, and they don't try to mimic his he warned me a couple of times not though i'm glad you really care for me love me whatever, but you can't mimic me a hundred percent you know good he, mentioned that he brought that up a couple of times okay, so you catch a good pattern that catches your attention but instead of going oh that guy that guy my teacher my teacher uh yeah no you, what are you doing with that pattern are you opening to that pattern are you doing your journey like a word to that pattern okay so uh so yeah sensei just, just uh just a comment here, i have seen you in the past um many years ago um just walk behind a student and sort of mimic them to the i mean it was it was uncanny how you were, uh good at that and i instantly recognized that was your capacity as a um as a student to emulate as best you could your, teacher and that like you said that wasn't good enough and, he demanded more and likewise um i feel as if that is continually your um comment to me which i appreciate again and again the, stick-to-it-ness of internal research not going outside yep oh yeah, yeah how many more books do you have to read no, none and you sit and you go through your own stuff, you figure it out it's beautiful stuff but there's a few tricks, easy open easy open not to glom on too fast now what this is happening that's happening easy let it let it unfold let it clarify itself so we try to teach some tricks that will help, okay, you know but in a certain way everyone's gotta, sit settle and open and take their own trip in their own universe their own creation okay, you're, we're in a very heavy we got scrunched in very heavy or we scrunched ourselves in here very heavy we have to untangle from this heavy and then not untangling you're probably still running into a lot more heavy it's less heavy but it's still heavy but you have to come to terms with that we try to help by saying hey it dimensionally gets finer or the uh say what game it said i opened up and it said i hate you oh easy don't panic nado easy settle open, on that same voice too say what, did you really say inferring this is a finer dimension and then it says i'm like i've been trying to talk to you for a long time you never listen oh okay easy settle open following that same line say what inferring a better finer and it says something like i'm just here to help you oh, oh, really we'll see easy settle open and, continue so you might run into harshness but it's, because we're a little heavy finer dimensions finer dimensions so that's where games like say what it's like i know you're an oh okay easy settle open next dimension say what yeah and it stops after a bit it might say for on the second one you're not too bright which is a little bit better than you're an okay easy settle don't panic open say what and i'll say something a little clearer and probably better i just continue and continue to continue, to continue yeah i've got to tell you this over and over again with these i know stories of my experience let me continue i'm on a roll and i basically did it easy this is weird i don't like snakes i'm sitting what the hell's going on easy, boom, okay, and very soon they weren't biting me they were smiling and very soon oh they're not snakes they're spiraling energies oh i have no bursting energies oh their energies oh cool i like energies hey, hey energies, nutrients we're using the word now oh okay oh okay so essentially the same game don't panic don't freak out don't jump the gun trust the ever finer so that it can show itself and it's truer, nature truer color truer level joy you want to say something no i just wanted to say i appreciate your infinite patience thank you okay thank you okay anything before we uh touch on tonight's topic no big deal big simple basics i think but anything before we yes danny here danny here danny there last week you asking the self to position better with the body yeah so that, that rang really true i as soon as you see her i thought yeah that's me like kind of in my life i stand to the side of things a little bit ah rather than being that's yourself, and your case yourself is off to the side i checked it yeah i know yeah so, could you notice anyway i noticed it yeah i live like that so i um so i um that that's interesting by the way i'm gonna i'm gonna his self is off to the side and he danny the person lives that way off to the side i don't know what that totally means yet but oh let's file it away sure i agree with you um so i, so i, after the class was finished i, it was a timely for me to invite, self to if it could position itself better with my body and um, it was the, response was immediate okay that um immediately any pain that i had in my body was gone it was like okay in your body my body left it's the most, i didn't you're breaking the pain was gone, yeah i'm breaking up sorry can you hear me yeah now and then okay so anyway i think you said in playing this game of being present of course i was a good first set and asking the self to position better okay, that i believe you said uh very quickly uh, body pains or certain pressures were just gone interesting good feedback if nothing else something happened something happened okay because by his idea he can't get the pain to go away but in playing this something happened okay, again people note that something happened go ahead then you got anything else here yeah it also it also after a while after, a while after i stopped i stopped withdrew from that and enjoyed not being, without pain it felt to me like you mentioned the road or track before, and it felt that i was on a truer course somehow, and it was and it was very familiar and friendly so a truer course did you say on track yeah yes yeah but i think that's what we're trying to do with this alignment thing square away bobby robert whatever and then as quickly as possible get to a better level and ask that level to line up better here so we're on track you're directly in line with yourself and the uh and the uh what happens at a better level of self your balance in your universe all of those things should naturally happen so yeah, yeah sounds good to me danny keep playing yeah, that was incredible and surprising thank you people, here if you're interested play, play okay, play just this whatever you whatever sense of self that you have now settle and, just a sense of self could you position here okay see the distance between bobby i the guy who says easy the i at first and the finer level of self uh what am i trying to say uh the distance factor after a while there is no real distance factor it's really, like here and now okay when we journey it feels like a distance and we use those words unfortunately okay but they're really starting up butt up okay so the better you can be on track the easier it might be for that better you to be present here, okay not the great word yet but good enough to sort of get us going for another session later, okay, all right we should move on a bit to tonight's topic uh the other day i was sitting on my front uh which i am wont to do ah and that's all what's what word, did i use uh out of out of out of out of out of sorts i couldn't quite yeah but i was just out of sorts a little unusual for me i mean i'm not great but i was kind of out of sorts i couldn't quite get going on anything okay hang out what the hell and i was reminded about my first basic that i liked i liked centering, and i caught on fairly quick to up and down energies okay uh let me stand for that oh okay you want to play with me [Music] there we are yeah, yeah okay easy, he's easy he's easy there are energies coming up through the system and an energy is going down through the system, easy let me figure that out i don't know if i understand stop it stop it easy here [Music] there are energies flowing up through the center and flowing down through the center easy, [Music], that pass i may be too fast for you people i don't know but that pass felt like they were coming up from floor level, up, and back down to floor level okay if you're just a big, that's fine you start with where you start okay easy and again energy, flow up forward fuller and flow down forward and forward ah, easy, there is a desire at a more open level i mean not sure on a tight level they're antagonistic, but easy, where, their real desire is to harmonize this with that and that with this okay, easy from a bit deeper energies flow up through the system through the system a few attire and, from there down through the system feels a bit deeper if i hang out with it deeper than the floor [Applause] easy, because of this more balanced harmony let's take a, little aside let's check a different piece here with that balance easy you are more balanced easy check your feeling how do you feel i don't know who are you let me think i don't know who i am but don't do that feeling here, because of the beats up and the beats down and the eventual harmony at a certain level, of the up and down ah things begin to feel different i who was uh disorganized what word did i use i use this conglomerate what word did i use uh santa swords out of sorts i who was out of sort and suddenly ah starting to get clearer i feel a bit better and that's what happened to me this week when i was actually out of sorts and i did this practice and feeling oh i feel much, much better ah, a better sense of things better ah of things okay all right let's take a pause on that so i couldn't think my way out of that out of sorts okay i was out of surgery i couldn't find i couldn't catch myself i don't know i started this and, and feeling better i'm not in the out of sorts world i was suddenly, feeling better much clearer on what i do how things work uh it was really nice okay so it's interesting to do an old basic practice uh at this stage of the game and realize how important it is how useful it is right one of the dialogue like there are many ways again a lot of this is repetitive but i think important uh [Music] he's positive i'm receptive yeah so let's say i'm out of sorts and i'd say ah say ah we're in the dojo brad give me a hand here for a while he's positive i'm receptive okay, see, you see you see positive receptive i don't know i felt a little smoother so that please mean that things are starting to settle open could i say easy, oh, yes, i was able to pick up him coming in positive much earlier than him crowding me, easy, well let me think about that let me i mean let me all guys that said you get them ahead of time don't go that easy, receptive, positive receptive and after a bit because of the using the positive receptive pattern it's a simple balanced practice he's positive i'm receptive okay very simple practice i'm beginning to feel better there's more room easier the eye a better sense of things theory comes and i can do other things a better sense of things other possibilities are showing here i'll call you in a moment thank you brad so uh you know when the uh corona thing hitting people could not go to the dojo and oh they were bitching and complaining that uh because they can't get on the mat they can't, they can't they can't okay i thought in one sense what a shame yeah i like the dojo but i'm not it's not the only way okay, i can have an imaginary partner who moves in and i step back if it's really good imagination it's the same as having a person there okay uh or you use other things uh, we got our baseball player that, strikes now the misunderstanding is i strike, instead of easy, there is a back wind up you call it that piece of it and that piece of it and that piece of it easy, because i really want to hit that ball at first easy, settle open there's a oh this back felt different there was a kind of a whoosh on the back don't study it to death not though easy back, moves forward and the forward felt a little i don't know equal fuller easy don't study it to death easy, back forth, easy let it happen easy, back oh this is a good one four why i said it was good is it felt like its back was really going further back not that i had to physically go back but i could feel this energy go further back, the forward of course is going out a little further if there was a ball with this bat i would have a pretty good trajectory, okay, so, batting tennis forehand backhand easy, forehand strike backhand strike easy you're using balance using forehand and backhand easy, so as the forehand backhand start to relate dialogue dance with each other i feel better i'm at a different level it's, aiding me to shift levels anytime you get that balance potentially can move into a better level okay, swimming a couple of you have swimming, a couple of you have swimming pools, uh stroke left, stroke, right, strokes, left strokes you hit the end of the pull stop there for a moment if you're going to play internally easy, easy, and then the next um go around stroke, huh these strokes even though i'm just screwing around here the arm moved out a little further and seemed to um seem to gather more yeah they're more now watch out oh that's it that's the trick i gather i gather and you just screwed it all up easy the eye eases the eye let these things go on then you can add to it and have your uh inhale exhale as you're stroking you boom whatever you do okay so you use that as your balancer if you're out of sort you go swimming but properly, with this stopping for a while at first easy, there open, let these things go on not getting caught up in how i can do it better, okay easy the eye easy get more space these things are freer to happen freer to happen okay so we've got let's do the pillow thing we did i think a week or two ago i like pillow throwing brad okay, i catch i catch easy, easy, throw, easy, catch, easy, throw, easy, catch, easy, it feels like it's starting to flow more both to catching in the throwing and throw easy, catch easy catch easy throat, okay so dumb game but if you're out of sorts and you got a partner throw the pillow back and forth with that easy, see what level you can get with that, okay how both after a while improve uh, in that series my thrower positive side was a little bit better than my receptive side but they'll catch up after a bit if i continue to easy they'll balance out for example okay so you got tennis golf baseball uh going for a walk okay left foot right foot easy, easy, left foot right foot easy, easy, gotcha yeah can you hear me yeah come on out here a bit she was on a she's a strange lady she was on a 21 mile hike last week i think i would not see if she wants to throw anything in here let me continue for a little bit i mentioned the story and it's a good time to mention it again i was teaching in, an energy awareness he's called the old days workshop with the people on the medical staff fort ord hospital it was after vietnam so they had a lot of patients who were traumatized by vietnam and they and once they got my drift they happened to mention that one afternoon they didn't know what to do with the guys they had a free afternoon and they said let's go to hike now they weren't doing it for therapy they're just trying to kill the afternoon, they went on a hike i don't know how long or how far but it wasn't 10 minutes it was quite a while and they realized when the guys came back they were quote better things were different and they were kind of stunned they didn't know what the hell happened other than the guys were traumatized they go on a hike and they came back more present calmer, more there for whatever i forget all the little details but they couldn't figure it out okay but, walking, i'm using that as an example of you're balancing easy and you continue walking and you walk a little bit better left and right easy and you continue walking now i'll ask katja did this make any sense to you after a 21 mile hike you know what i'm talking about here yeah help you, start to hide you you're struggling with all kinds you want to come over here, they may want to see your face okay now, we have really a problem okay, i guess we go with that so um you start the hike you start with you're noticing things you're noticing things you're noticing details you, get to get thrown off by abide by things you might feel a little ache in the knee and, as you move you settle you settle the breath is changing you settle you get more comfortable and the eyes settle open yes and then you realize after two or three hours that little things that were bothering you actually you maybe still notice them but they are not bothering you anymore so you have changed into a different level where you can deal with that really, well, and i think also um you start processing things um things that are bothering you things thoughts that are in your head so i can completely see that after a longer hike that you come back you, you change the level you, where you move and move and, i felt that going through to this 21 miler, yeah, similar to the yeah you change you change the level where you where you're operating from and uh it has a physical expression you feel it through your breath you feel it through your walking style yeah through your body walking style and even the thought patterns even thought patterns especially thought patterns i think that because that's, that's, coming up and yeah, thank you thank you let's see so 21 mile hike for fun you people are weird you gotta beg me to get off the porch jesus if i can park close to starbucks i'll give it a shot but boy, anyway uh so, whether so anyway i think at first i would really highlight that easy the eye thing to i don't know one to remind yourself you're doing internal work yes you're using an outside form but you're doing internal work okay, and that's where a lot of aikido people missed it even though sensei there they couldn't get a sense sensei there they couldn't get a sense of this internal work so they continue to keep talking about the outer form he did his little finger up high no, i saw him do it with that finger up i know he had a sum of highs jesus christ people what are you looking at, okay, what's this internal work what's going on in there that was important i would suggest that you remind yourself that's why i have you swimming one lap and stop at the edge, easy for him a couple of moments whatever easy, and then let the body again stroke back and then easy okay i, think sometimes in like you know we get so busy doing techniques that we don't stop and remember again we're doing internal work easy open easy open and then and then and then back again easy open okay uh okay uh in the early days i used to do a lot more of that uh, doing some kind of inner work and then techniques for a while and then back to the inner work and then techniques for a while i used to do a lot of that and do it now i should, highlight that at least for a class oh that reminds me in case i forget uh anyone interested san francisco i'm going to teach at the geary street dojo 1pm sunday the 15th of may which is not the day after tomorrow uh the next week sunday so 1 o'clock deary street dojo, uh, aikido class i haven't talked at the san francisco dojo for dojo for a couple of years i've been teaching a little bit in mountain view but not san francisco so any of you san francisco, so any of you san francisco people, ah, [Applause], hope to see you ah okay so balance, balance uh so i think i'm saying if you're kind of ah find something simple to balance with okay, find something simple to balance with okay you got a backyard you got a stick womp, easy, comes up it goes down easy, you're doing internal work don't get caught up with that hit it higher go heavy out there easy, easy this is just a reference of balance easy because of that up and that down easy, easy a susan uh chopping wood you're susan are you on tonight yes anything about that first simple beginning, acts up acts down just with that centering sense the simplicity of that first piece you can say better than i me well you put it really well just inherently the system naturally develops and finds its a sense of balance with that up down so there's a very natural progression of the balance a natural what of the balance progression of a better and better sense of balance okay as you continue it up and down of the axe and easy the eye it does progress yes, yeah very naturally yeah you like the way i said remember it's internal ease of the eye anything there to clarify i think you said earlier um as you're doing it easy the eye practice of and balance is sort of who am i who um not just my outlook but who am i in this balancing practice okay so what we're doing there i, don't want to throw too many pieces at you but easy since there's more space and the eye is a little more at a better level easy the eye okay now we took a simple approach energies up and down easy and as the energies up and down get more harmonious you will begin to feel different better more harmonious, what she's bringing up is now let's have the, uh, uh, person on center acknowledge themselves what's the phrase you're using who am i yeah who am i who am i [Applause], this will kind of refer to this when i go bobby and at a certain level bobby's not my right name robert after a while not my right name because, this is bigger and better nado okay anyway uh so uh we can fill it in what goes on here the energy beats go on and more little more advanced centered end circle and circled and centered and at a certain level of harmony there who are you now and you experience yourself, trying to think about who i am let me think about that no, no the experience of who you are so how does that level person plunk the guitar keys how does that level of person, chant, or, sing a few lines of that song uh how does that person throw the ball if ball throwing is your thing, how does that person at that level do knee kill aikidos uh so, we, uh i want a character there, center circle are the energies the character so we want to uh i can't remember the words tonight but uh position assembly not the right word huh position i thought we go with words i'm using [Applause], squaring away balance huh, balance, balance, no, anyway forget about it's not, important, uh, got off on a little tangent there no i'm put on the head okay where are we where are we where are we yeah steve here uh you know early in the week not early i guess a day or so ago uh maryland was what i would describe as out of sorts a lot of issues at the office and so and forth and forth and i just had gotten the email of the title of today's uh workshop and i read the title to her and it immediately cooled her out and, yeah but what i'm seeing you know you know you see the title out of sorts and you think oh there's a condition there's a situation that's a problem and really what you showed us with the you know the up and down energy flow is what's out of swords is your relationship to your own energy, yeah get balanced in some form we're saying hey people are a lot of forms uh we could do better in the aikido realizing we're balancing the receptive positive thing are really to say use that really realize what you're doing with that a lot of people do the outer stuff but don't catch the anyway so balance, simple easy useful so if you're out of sorts fine that's simple i like the up and down beats i kind of very early started with that uh, i liked oh sensei's uh other form of doing that fire to the water, to the fire as they get more balanced a sense of steam that clues you in that they're balancing so if you get too much fire you burn the water away water away if you get too much water you just drown the fire there's not going to be any steam so steam is a reference for the harmony at whatever levels there's multiple levels right uh, fire water easy soon there'll be a sense of steam there okay better fire better water well for me better means for example the fires would like begin to show bigger hotter, and the water would begin to look like a deluge not just the shower water but a day load it just might sense as it got better and better the steam then would get better and better okay, uh so that's a good uh sign for there's a certain amount of harmony there how do i know the steam really feels senses steamy and full, that tells me there's a certain amount of harmony there and then we can either continue or take up a residence at that level, who am i at this level kind of thing you okay with that steve sensei may i interject something this is sean, i, feel as if uh this is a this is a constant thing with me that you um there's this incremental uh, uh improvement um in an incremental uh, finer, and, you have utmost patience with that you have, you have distinguished that with incredible discernment the ability to, say this level this level this level and i'm, i, i, feel as if i'm a little bit on the um, what do you want to call it uh the slow slide when it comes to um yes discernment differences thank you thank you we have to settle a bit and be in a finer dimension in a finer dimension i discern better okay, now in your case i think we're coming into a problem of a misunderstanding of the underworld okay therefore it's difficult at first for you to get into a finer here and now where you can begin to discern i, there's a monster under there there's a monster under there oh, the fear of the underworld i think is what's going on okay so it makes it very hard you can't move into a finer dimension here you can do it here but that's not going to do the job okay uh you can be aware of finder and read books about finer stuff that's fine that's fine but we have to do this fullness factor and to do the fullness factor we have to deal with the underworld which scares the out of some people all i can say is if you go sense that it's finer dimension it'll show its true nature, it's, their nutrients it's underwater nutrients i like the change of word nutrients wow, and because of better nutrients the plant center self the character the person so i think the discernment is, hard because you haven't quite settled enough into a finer dimension because we have to settle down into a finer dimension and you haven't come to terms with that yet so sorry to say in public sean but there it is and i'm talking to a lot of other people probably thank you sensei yeah anything, i don't know if i have anything more on balanced practices let's see uh [Music] just a sense again aikido and then we just increase the size of it i'm not sure what we're going to do let's try this presentation yes okay, okay easy, easy, receptive end of it down up positive, okay, so the picture's a bit bigger i wouldn't maybe i've done this uh on uh on at first i would have done something simple like one step good enough just to get things going it's time to feel more present more easy, easy we're going to get down reset up, positive, okay, so we just introduce a little more depth in our process okay so we've got left right we've got left right we have receptive, receptive, positive and we added a little more depth, easy, deep and from death positive from death from death so all we do is just open up i think good enough as we progress along we, open up as you're okay with one uke when they're doing medium easy technique you throw in two uk's doing easy medium attacks, if you're okay with two you might throw in three uh because you're, starting to grow along with the situation, okay, kind of thing so there'll be a progression susan said it is a natural progression just in your centered and as you continue, a natural progression in the world you're dealing with so her natural progression i think was from being a wood chopper as she progressed she started to be very tuned into that piece of wood uh, cut on more of an angle there's just a sense of oh yeah cut it on an angle or something i'm not using quite the right words but she decided to include other things not just a hitter but the wood also was brought into the game through certain woods you have to hit a certain way for it to split okay kind of thing did i say that all right close enough ah where are we anything, you got the sense of hey is mark here from new zealand uh, of course it is um we've been doing a lot of um centering grounding and um the thing that i've been noticing is um it's not so much surprising but it still kind of amazes me just how much the more you stay with it just how much else gets included it just things just get taken care of and so you don't need to go out to take care of those things they just naturally get included as long as you hang out it's kind of really hang out um, with, your with yourself and your in the process that you're doing don't you don't need to go out just to keep improving that and everything else gets included it's, it's it blows my mind really yeah it's yeah it's some of the fancy word synchronicity which always happens that people on the journey say oh my god that was perfect timing for that to happen you know if you think about a book or something somebody hands you the book here it's a gift for you and it's what you're looking for whatever you know so, yeah as you get better the, as the center gets better the circle activates and, you start to get a harmony between those two that are just naturally happening synchronicity word we, use there yeah, so, yes, yes, anyway good and again be careful of being a drawn out too much or something uh something happens and, uh i tried to show it here we were doing i forgot something uh and uh oh where you jump oh i got the answer because as you were as i was batting i noticed there was a little deeper back oh that's it you go back and then you hit but i went back it's not the back of this level going back, yeah, yeah and i potentially screw it up it'll stop working it might work for a few but then it'll stop working and you say well that was or i must have made that up that's a fantasy when no you were right on it but you took it over you came back to enlister to take this over and you're back at a lesser kind you get so excited yeah people you have to be an alert here i think we're going to uh be finishing earlier tonight quarter of here, anything before we finish up yeah it's mike from new zealand sensei hey mike as opposed to mark yes well there's mark in this mic yes um well with me i have fun with the new zealand people sir it's all right it's not it's not a problem um the other weekend i was at our anzac day commemorations which is our annual um remembering that the fall and the in the wars, and that i was sitting i was trying to sit down somewhere the only place that was available was um on a rock and of course the rock isn't designed for me to sit comfortably on and it was excruciatingly painful actually um, but what i what suddenly came to mind was, this practice basically and i and i had never it never occurred to me before for whatever reason to use the practice of just centering and, and settling and aligning um and then noticing so not, hooking on to but just noticing that in fact there was much less discomfort yeah, even though i was sitting on something that was inherently uncomfortable as soon as i allow my attention to go towards the fact oh it's not so painful no, no, that's going outside again and having to bring myself back yeah um and yeah found out a really useful exercise yeah really good that's all then that's an old, style teaching tool to put your students whatever in pain so they sit through the pain what you're hoping for is to get to a better level but a lot of people just take it as taking the pain period but there's a deeper meaning there yeah, yeah um and i did notice that in fact as soon as i stopped the practice i was in pain in order i hadn't magically made the pain go away but you know i've done something within myself that meant that my body was better aligned and therefore i wasn't experiencing the pain in the same way yeah yes so a lot of things depend how we see them how we deal with them at depend on the level we're at weird bobby doesn't deal with very well okay that's that level another level i can cope, to a certain degree with it but don't push me too far kind of thing at another level much better yeah so it's that same pattern you see what level are you at um you know yes the world is crazy read the newspaper, no crane is getting a little crazier i mean things are costing more every day there's an extra dollar here and an extra dollar here and, oh my god they're going to do something with the with the law bro row and whoever oh my god and, they won't let up what level do you want to be at in dealing with that because you can get caught up in the insanity of it if you like doing that feel free but it's like the hard rock you can settle and get to a better level your perspective is different your choice your choice just a couple of simple tricks to learn your choice i think good enough for tonight short one ten minutes thank you very much sure thank you for hanging out with that story thank you so much, thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you for this evening sensei thank you thanks everybody thanks essay and thanks very much to the team for making this possible sweet ass see you danny the uh bye you looking good sorry i missed your call yesterday daddy all right catch up a bit later yep, danny you look 20 years younger good to see you guys good to see you richard all right i'm kenny all right i guess we'll look for you next week thank you again take care thank you bye-bye

try it here because my other camera is off tonight so uh we'll figure something out anyway ah, carryovers, observations insights questions about last week what the hell ever we did last week hello out there [Music] get close to your mind say something for me for us say something for us wind us up get us going come on well sensei i've been looking at my arrogance, arrogance, huh, okay, i, feel like it's my interpretation the phrase you might remember let's see how do you put it, um, don't, move on the first uh first rush of energy yeah first push him yeah for you know you've only told me i don't know seven thousand times maybe it's only five hundred i don't know um, but uh but uh i, really found uh that what it led me to, was, uh a discovery of fairly um you might call it like i kept it hidden right, i knew better than to tell people that i knew they were wrong i could patiently listen to them but inside i was hearing them from the from the standpoint of they're wrong but they need to talk about what they need to talk about, what they need to talk about and i really feel like i've been able to make a shift into they're right about something i'm also right about something you know and if we can if i can really hear where they're coming from i can get better i can learn i can develop myself um i don't win as many arguments which is kind of i was brought up that you know someone disagreed with you, win the argument that settles it you're right you know um susan's not on the line but she might he might be able to talk about that experience, uh, but yeah so it's been uh it's really been an incredible uh, a real change for me um [Music], i feel much better and, people you know people i work with, um, report that i don't seem as aloof or you know yeah okay so okay so all right so maybe first trick there is uh in uh in coming together with somebody uh you say you're catching it you're being pushed, okay so far okay and if you're pushing for bang, you come back fast on them and whatever push on them take it over or whatever right because you're being pushed so, what if a little trick there is when you're meeting somebody going into such a situation that there's more of an opening that you don't wait till you're pushing and try to deal with it you can but you're in the middle there uh that's a little more open, knowing there's going to be energies uh, stuff that will help you uh be better with them so maybe start it a little earlier, open, okay instead of the, one more click the guy who's getting who's starting to get pushed a bit but he may not notice it but then he's going to be pushed he's he made that one extra move and there's where he gets pushed so let's do the other way let's settle back and open up and, get into that situation so here one more click lower or open to that is that is that kind of a simple trick just to start the game going is that sounds like really good advice i'll give it a shot and i'll let you know how it works yeah, it's the right direction because, even when i catch myself quickly if the person i'm in conversation with is very sensitive i, have a few and they're like wait what, you know what's that and i'm like no, that's me dealing with my own internal thing yeah you know but, people still catch it and you know people who don't talk about it probably catch it too so yeah i think it's uh it's got there's some practice there no we can't unfortunately expect them to know how things work and to be proper with you or me okay, uh i know sometimes i get a lot of energy, and it's just for me and me but people near me are like as if i'm angry at them i'm not angry at you i'm just getting a hell of a lot of energy it's me and me but uh i've gotta cover that better i've gotta i've gotta cover that better i've gotta be bigger earlier with that so it doesn't boom or they take that personal it's not a personal attack i know it may even sound like one or my energies may feel like one or, or something, um, it's not it's not anyway but that okay somebody, is going here tonight when i hang out a bit with that which we call that addition sign uh we're gonna head that way i hope i think, but before we do anything, anything, come on come on something this uh soon i wanted to can you hear me okay yeah soon yes i want to thank you for the continuity work that we did several weeks ago i've been carrying that forward and that's been very helpful in the sense that i have a habit of wanting to start from scratch in situations rather than carry over everything i have and energetically i've been doing a better job of skip saying instead of saying how do i start this energetic process for this situation it's all right where what do i carry forward that statement actually kicks in a lot so thank you for that yeah uh you think you're at your smallest could i say in this situation and then you have to start all over again is that is that what you're saying yeah or more a situation comes up and i say well i gotta start my processing here instead of that oh what do i carry over just that simple statement has allowed the previous work to carry through a lot better yeah one trick there is if we establish a better it's all inner work right a better, inner, setup, okay then when something happens hey click and the better one is there you go quicker uh you don't have to uh, clear the same forest, and cut down all the debris and stuff each damn time you get kind of hate spiffy at it now i'll ask you in training to go through the level so you're well versed on those first few levels to get the pattern because the patterns will just continue and continue finer and finer but we're not saying you got to come back to weird bobby and then okay but i'd like you to know how bobby to robert tanado using my languaging or level one to a level two to a level, one to a level two to a level three, works, if you establish a level three more if you like that form and you establish level three uh that sort of becomes potentially your norm not that you won't drift out of it towards the two but it's, been established a bit better so it's easier to go from a two to a three hey yeah kind of thing right so it kind of fits in i think with your question trick of the trade it does i want to thank you for that it's been very helpful yeah and again for those people that might uh also think the other way around and think, why is he starting at this level again i already know that uh really important really get the flavor and double check that it's really the flavor, okay, yeah, uh see when i walk into dojo some uh, if i remember being in a dojo it's been a while uh some uh some days i sort of remember i'm a high rank but i'm not there yet i have to quickly go quickly just like boom to be the proper one on the mat uh it's sort of similar isn't it yeah so anyway uh both use the click at a time to really catch the terrain then you'll get faster at it okay, not as an idea because you've actually gone through the terrain more than once many times as part of your ta-da and that whole series can get very fast okay, but only if you've had the experience then you experience through all of that very fast you clear the decks fast to a finer level okay well since they covered a lot of territory, boom it would be oh sensei now this is going from an old man and he would do it on purpose sometimes watch i, i can't get up i can't walk boom and suddenly you couldn't push him or if you're trying to push him up the stairs and he went into one of those my most sensitive type uh it'd be like this boulder you couldn't push so he played games uh anyway he, enjoyed that it was an attention-getter it amused him and it caught our attention what's he doing you know anyway blah, blah somebody something, doesn't say this is justin i i've really enjoyed um especially in the last, session or two um as we had as we had spoken about briefly the rephrasing of these energies as nutrients in a way i like that um that's been helpful for, me anyway but it's been a very useful language to communicate these ideas with other people who um may, not, energy is kind of vague it could be woo-woo it could be sci-fi like quantum like what are we talking about but nutrients are pretty straightforward um friendlier, to them yeah, it makes sense um let me jump in for a sec please remember energies, yes, commie yes if you're older l caps schmooze yes nutrients, yes, lament shows baby same old stuff yeah what word is comfortable for you and then as you hang with it and open to it and allow it to be present and for like a words dialogue itself ah you get better, a sense of it you may come up with your own word so i'm sorry go ahead no, that that's exactly on point um it's trying to speak with people using a language that they can assimilate and they can work with um this was this has been for the times anyway as you've said me it'll adapt maybe in other times but for the times this has been a an easy one for, myself and for others to be working with let me jump in one moment so in case people don't know who you are uh he deals with the general public could i say every day okay uh he, uh he, is part of a clinic a healing clinic a variety of forms of healing i believe uh anyway so all day a variety of people are coming in so he's finding that word uh for the variety of normal people that come in they're not aikidos they're not tai chi masters uh whatever, that that's a nice word for them they seem to have a better feeling and sense, for that word okay i just want to establish who you were sorry go ahead well said um and it's true that's so it's a it's a health care center and there's a variety of people that come through, um, from every walk of life um, you know so it's true they're not they're not training on the mat and in most cases any martial art maybe they've never even heard of aikido for that matter, but um whatever they're doing with their life as a layperson as a skilled a tradesperson as a person that's in management or government or whatever it really spans the gamut here's a simple convenient framework they can plug themselves into it makes sense and they can apply it in a practical experiential way on a day-to-day basis as they line up to whatever situations they're stepping into they can settle and open and get a better read on what the story is before they jump into something better line themselves up as the, appropriate character for that story um to make room for all the nutrients that they need to, function well in that situation first of all with the right yeah which is what we're going to cover a little bit uh excellent and i don't want to get ahead of ourselves i'll oh it's fine i'll duck out at this point okay um uh anything i'm gonna move on here soon but we have a minute here anything, yeah hi sensei it's dusty i'll ask something that's okay, um, autumn told me about a quote that you said and i'm probably paraphrasing here but it was um something along the lines of uh well learning from our mistakes is, okay it's meeting, yourself, meeting the person that can solve those problems, i'm not mixing the quote right now but my question is george leonard talked about taking the hit as a gift and as a gift as a gift yeah and then you're called the last week was something like well i understand why learning from mistakes is a good thing meeting, the self that can yourself that can solve the problem is where the world work is at but like hang on a second just stop give me a second give me a pump can you see me whoa i got it okay, you took the hit now what's the benefit it calls up naturally more nutrients and suddenly i'm better at taking hits or maybe i don't feel like taking a kiss where are you going but i move appropriately so take the hit so that if you use it right you can grow with that oh since i said that more than once in a few different forms, is that mary up there no that's kenny okay, ah, so go ahead i'm sorry i jumped in well no we just seeing you stand up and do that was all of a sudden it was it was your response was much simpler than i thought i was like yeah just, do it just take the hit as a gift but i guess i'm wondering like boom the hit like what's happening at that moment the connection that the there's something going between your the hand and your head like your whole system is reacting now if our system is more open it gets to react faster so i, stretch it out so you can see it i took the head and said okay wait a minute what's happening i, just took the same thing and i stretched it out well that's going on really fast okay uh i was teaching private uh i could do that now and then at home they asked me to teach private to certain westerners anyway there was this naval captain and uh i don't know i must have fell asleep or something, and uh, this american naval captain uh it was striking me and as he was striking me i caught him in the eye and i felt real bad about it because he's my private student i gave him a black eye dear god he's a naval captain uh so anyway i was very apologetic next time he came i gave him a, bunch of flowers for his wife in case she didn't think i was a mean guy beating up on her husband and anyway but dang it can happen really fast but that's an idea fast i gotta react and you go crazier but so to slow things down and see how they work okay and then practice with the slower forms, and then eventually you speed it up a bit, following a certain pattern that you're using, and then you continue and after a bit you get fast okay tai chi is a martial art yes it's an exercise for old people in the park uh but, it's also a martial art even though they're practicing very slow in a mix-up they're very fast with it but yet i'm going to do is basically practice slow kind of thing i don't know if i said that well i'm not a great tai chi master but anyway, we covered dusty yeah perfect thank you okay, [Applause], and these simple processes when i asked you to go uh i sort of mentioned a little bit a couple minutes earlier uh from bobby to robert and doe uh or a one by one to a two by two to a three by three after all you get oh i know that it's like no do the other way around take your time and flavor it more it's like you're a little kid and you're eating too fast and mommy says chew your food and taste it so i'm just asking you to taste the process along the way because you'll be human condition you'll be too fast and i know this i've, tasted this before mom i don't have to taste it now i'll just swallow it, i know it's really important to, really have some depth of experience depth of feeling whatever you want to call that ah and of course later yes it is faster but it's faster through the experience not through the knowing about it okay something like that okay, okay, this one here there is a little problem or confusion that exists ah, let's see let me use an example if i may ross you're on get my momentum yes, okay, uh can i use your comment from i believe it was last week as a reference sure okay you were talking about getting to a better level which is that line there okay and it was a nice level right yeah it was very nice and you said oh, here i'm a nice guy right, yeah, i started i looked on you a little bit there and i said but who who's the character and you blinked a little bit on me okay, not saying anything's wrong but we do have a confusion i'm trying to clarify and so that was a good example so sorry if i brought that up pointing you out as an idiot or anything bear with me okay that's fine all right we get to a better level and the qualities at that level are, nicer softer easier something okay and because we haven't distinguished the character line that's why this is a cute diagram there is a character line here that is often missed by people they identify as the term i call that terrain okay, at that level terrain nice uh calming uh, whatever it is and the identity oh i'm the nice person i'm the calm person i'm the loving person i'm the uh whatever person okay and that'll get you into trouble in the bigness of creation something because you're missing a main piece the character the center the plant whatever you want to call this guy okay are we sort of sort of okay for starts well i hear what you're saying so we're going to do something here let's see can everybody just settle, i was going to do standing but with my other camera it's too much hassle so just settle ah as if we're easy, it's, settling into a better level whatever it may be for, you okay easy settle there's a different terrain gonna show up for you here a little bit what am i looking for easy approaching a terrain i thought that was katya is that you ross oh it's my dog i knew somebody was barking [Music] hey everyone easy a terrain a terrain [Applause], somebody want to throw out some examples one word should all be that's necessary or very short phrase here what kind of terrain sense [Music], what level you're at what are the qualities there again whatever okay remember ross hit a level that was nice, what's yours open mic something i need some examples let's say it's bob energies nutrients of clarity in this terrain, okay in this terrain feeling, like you're the, clear one okay, oh i'm clear not yet not yet not yet that's the terrain that's very good, you want to hang out in there and whatever soak with it for a while that's fine but you don't have the whole picture yet that's a nice terrain somebody what's your terrain you got nothing you got under there come on easy you've been settling you've been opening, isn't that calmers and not quieter is it not nicer something hello a stewardship one at a time supportive, supportive okay, okay, it's a supportive terrain okay again to be that tendency to think that train is the character oh i'm the supported one or i'm the clear one as noah because usually not yet not yet let's continue with terrain one more example easy settle open dimensionally we're moving into finer dimension here that inner sense of finer easy settling i get a jungle very quickly rainforesty okay plants growing [Music], okay uh so people don't get confused uh that'll be some kind of life-giving it's very alive very what they'll they call a, rainforest jungle it's, damn alive why anyway so you're not tarzan yet okay that's the terrain and when the last one somebody easy settle, the terrain that you're since experiencing since experiencing yeah expansive, cold it's that terrain, yes, see inner finer dimensions aren't in their spine or smaller it opens up into a terrain if you would or a sense of more space don't get carried away with that don't there's all more space more space i'll go into that another time but uh definitely a inner sense of more expansion expensiveness yes okay, now, again the tendency is for people to identify as the terrain okay so what should we do here to make this centered character plant that's the that's the terrain who is the plant who are you the plant see uh to sort of overlay the uh potted plant picture we've settled down to a better level dirt, okay, a better level dirt and you say oh i'm data and like no, no that's the terrain that's a level of dirt dimensional energies that you're at now we shift into the center the character the plant with the center of it up down centered pump, who are you with the terrain that you're on yes with some up and down pump now we're sort of i don't know what to say shifting our focus i don't like that focus word uh but it's shifting from the terrain yes, yes to this line here who are you the character who are you the plant so you feel yourself feel yourself okay now on this one and be prepared to play the and game so real quick one word feel yourself what this first one you're feeling yourself plant center character what you're feeling first feeling okay i'm more rooted okay and then again i might go rooted, okay, who are you you're the rooted one and soon we'll get to an end so rooted okay better rooted okay somebody alive okay live and alive instills my terrain still i'm sorry still was my terrain so aliveness coming up through that stillness okay there's a terrain now we're working you the centered plant character you're more alive is that what you're, more alive is that what you're saying yes okay i'm more alive i'm whatever more energetic and you could even probably feel that through the body right like hey we're alive okay now there's more than just that first word that you threw up so i add the and so, all right so we continue more, alive and alive and bob's case it was in the land of clear uh, who's the character there bob the center the plant uh calm and reflective one okay calm and reflective one okay calm reflective okay i think he threw two of us calm and reflective reflectively calm it's fine now you experience yourself as the character calm and to some degree reflective, okay, somebody you got the game so we're on our terrain but we shift focus i don't like that word uh shift our attention from the terrain to the plant-centered character and who are you what are you feeling about you the centered one the character, more accepting then say it's molly and i just want to say that in this moment this character is feeling a total effervescence in my entire body as though yeah that's fine let's keep it short molly i'm just saying you know and there's a sense of, being the terrain oh almost it's like okay no, no, no, stop i want to be clear here molly terrain is the terrain and plant is the plant yes there's a strong relationship but let's be clear because we have an unclarity between these two these two so don't be too fast and talking about oh i'm part of this terrain because now we're going to get confused again potentially i'm trying to clarify this confusion i'll be scared i'll be still i like effervescent and, i like that up and down center flavor you, the persian character plant you the centered one hey i'm effervescent i've seen that one before by the way of course, many of us have oh there here comes molly, yes, okay, bear with me i am okay and i would like to do at least three or four, zones of magic number on and what else what else keep the up down pump going uh so bob you said what the what the your next two were clear and reflective sensei clear and clear and reflective sensei clear and reflective and let's throw another and at you and continuing the feeling of the centered one and sometimes a little trick there i, think helps i repeat uh the two i had before, and what's next powerful, okay reflective and, with some power okay so good and it just happened a different way it may have confused them he'd be uh picking up calm and it's something powerful and be like no wait, which is it or something uh so there's different attributes at this level with what we're doing i'm calm i have a good perspective and, i'm very strong feel that strength yeah that'll be something you can feel in the body that we're oh i am stronger, i didn't feel like picking up weights before but at this moment just screwing around on yours why i wouldn't mind just checking a couple of dumbbells and well i'm feeling stronger yes are you any, of you following me did we do enough of, of those i'll walk you through one if you're confused along the way russ you following me sure yeah okay, okay so again i'm just trying to clarify a confusion that when we hit the terrain and damn the trains in finer dimensions it's nicer finer dimensions are nicer okay uh, they they're vibing remember the trains are different levels of vibration rate heavy terrain i can feel it next level terrain i feel a little z easy, next level of terrain i'm not sure if i'm feeling i'm still i have to shift here to sense feeling oh yeah it's quieter calmer easier yeah so those are dimensional ever finer through the dimensions using terrain or these floors we've called them before okay ah, so the difference between the character and the terrain now this is kind of important that i, would sort of like you to have some practice and feeling for it because come the day which for some of us isn't that far away where you're going to be out of here and you're going to cross over into the next and because your people are pretty cool you're going to end up in a probably a fair level of astral plane let's say okay, and in a fair level of astral plane it is nice to rain it vibes nice okay, what i often hear from folks if i check them out see how they're doing is oh my god there's no physical pain here where i'm at how nice the body doesn't hurt anymore, there the terrain is nice okay but then they tend to get stuck there it's nice but they get stopped there where we should really be able to continue and continue and continue kind of a ways to go yet uh but when they don't know okay this is the train and it's beautiful in whatever form you're picking up the beauty of the astral plane you'll be in who are you who are you and work that for lack of word center line who are you when we get more harmony and balance between that another form of balance that better balance should facilitate moving, past that level dimension into the next finer level dimension we have a journey to continue we're not finished yet on one nice astral plane move along if you don't want to move along you hit that plane after a while you'll get bored or something will happen and you'll be born again and then you go around you'll be born again and but eventually you're going to get a little bit bored with it okay tired of that like jesus said there's something more than just returning trips anyway i'm straying off too far here but the balance of center okay, and that terrain line and the center line, facilitate moving through into the next finer dimension that's there okay if you miss that part again there'll be a tendency to be too heavily into the awareness and you'll be aware of it but you're not quite really and it's certainly there you've missed something it's hard to continue properly after a bit so this is uh so this pattern is, a good pattern that i hope in some way you remember okay you remember because when you hit the astral plane you want to uh, utilize that if you're smart okay i've seen some beings hit the astro plane and, very quickly some months whatever uh very, quickly just develop, develop, develop, develop, and i'm sort of like wow what a what a lot of development within a year mart time a year's span i don't know what it is in their time and in that plane but uh within i've seen some people really develop, okay, as i mentioned nikki happily surprised me is he stayed with whatever pattern he was working and he developed and stayed with and he developed because he really wanted to be come back more advanced as an actor really wants to make the big time so he's, setting it up there so he can better move in on the form that he's taking a little feeling i have about you autumn that, that this your more original self uh made that call and it's, all unfolding for you especially when you can reach contact that inner self we get there by easing the eye anyway it's another conversation this self, uh we've uh we've mentioned it before uh but i have to really highlight it some night but not tonight where the hell are we i'm going to get lost here uh the terrain is the terrain the plant character you character part of that the balance between you at that level and that level back to you is a balance pattern we play with that with the center circle we, did it standing, last month last month uh center to the circle as if there are energies or something emanating, circle is touched and it retorts back okay at which time the center that's a slurpee stand up feels a bit better makes another call hey i feel better but i don't quite feel great yet greatness that's sent out to the circle, is its partner it goes oh okay the circle is a great warehouse boom, sends back one hell of a lot of nutrients that's its job okay which the plant boom uh so, that how am i getting into this stuff why am i getting this stuff now are you following anything i'm saying or did i get lost here you better say something before i get carried away where are we here another form of balance [Music] see all the different forms i try to lay out are based on sort of where we are in the manifest creation, [Applause], and how to travel through how to navigate the manifest so i present different forms center to the circle is a cool form okay uh the cross uh addition sign is a cool form the one by two by three by is cool potted plant really a nice one it's cool uh but we're passing through the same terrain i'm just what to say not coming at it from different ways but different presentations because some of you might get a little different, oh sensei told me said you'll have your favorite, okay, but try some of the others it's good okay, so you have your favorite uh, but you get a different a different sense by trying some of the others a little something in there same terrain but you picked up a little bit different by shifting the word from energies coming back there to nutrients a lot of people go oh that's a bit different we're still talking about the same stuff oh it's schmooze oh it's coming uh but, each sense gives you a little different i don't know the word flavor perspective we're not changing the whole diagram we're not saying the universe works this way no it doesn't work it's not to say no it doesn't not work that way we're talking about the same manifest universe how to move through it into finer and finer all the while clearing the eye so as we do this one easy the eye to start to establish you see the eye a little more room and more subtle so that a better center lines can happen okay, as we easy and settle next dimension better character turing finer vibe of terrain all the while the easy the eye is moving along with it okay, till eventually you won't be i anymore be oh self, okay, and then after a bit as you continue that'll upgrade want to show finer of itself so my words naturally change oh a more original self a truer self it's just a continuation of this easing the i the i dot, self easy, with that a finer self, okay, so that's the pattern that we're using uh to work our way from the heavier remember we're in a pretty heavy level here yes easy i mean there's a bobby but there's a weird bobby kind of tighter there's an insane totally off the wall dangerous lock them up immediately weird bobby easy, easy, easy it's all here and now okay so that helps it's here and now here and now okay it's not just an idea here and now includes the under half now we've i've mentioned that before may go, back on it because it's very important the under half is not known well, okay underworld oh my god okay, hell is down there heaven is up there stay away from this go to that misunderstanding settling opening at first there might be some fear because there uh that's why i told you the snake story the snake pit story that's why i mentioned bob what's her name then spanish none saint teresa of avila sensei and apparently from bob was telling me she was sitting and suddenly she's experiencing a sense of wild animals biting her oh i've been there done that mines were snake years of wild animals hey cool we're kindred souls here we all hit that level at that at that level of it this is horrible it's fighting me easy, settle, have the guts to stay with it and open and settle some more it'll just get finer and continually just get finer and we can uh more effortlessly move through the heaviness of manifest to the finer and then they'll be even much, better which will hold off right now don't get your head to a fire ahead of yourself there, but following that pattern so once you get a good pattern follow it try some of the others okay, all right where the hell am i, don't know say something did i say anything intelligent you know you were talking about the different approaches that um that's akin to different languages right so um the potted plant or the one by two by three by or the different kind of vehicles are like talking about something in spanish or something in english sounds different some languages are better for certain particular, conversation and be careful of certain traps i'm not going to get into this so oh they must understand because they have a word for it oh you do too just no one's introduced you to it oh the great spirit oh you mean nutrients man i know what you're talking about something like that i what i'm trying to say is i don't want you to bulk with somebody else's fancy word or some other cultured word because you don't quite catch it one reason didn't go heavy into the jet or at all basically into the japanese uh you say oh they understand i don't i'm a westerner i don't understand i'll never make it i didn't want you all to go there go there so from the get-go we tried to use more english words why not yeah like uh you know the eskimos have more words for snow than we do i don't worry about that i live in california, anyway, uh hello out there in the world where are we does that do you anything hopeful clarification on enjoy the terrain but don't forget to feel yourself with a few different and okay, uh since bob here one thing about separating clearly distinctly the experience of the character in the terrain, when i'm the character clearly then i can begin to actually experience absorbing the nutrients from the terrain into myself and that begins the process of change of change but actually experiencing the nutrients coming into me yeah so then you sort of overlay the potted plant format if you like yeah, yeah so you can uh mix and match to your benefit it's on this beautiful train and i'm experiencing this and this and this and that and, okay now all of that is really feeding into me here, here, and now we can move into the next beats of it [Music] um, [Music], slip by me slip by me hello out there where the hell are we are you following me is that was that sort of semi clear i, i would agree with what bob steve here uh what bob just said just said and what i find so useful is that they don't seem like even though terrain is terrain and, character or center is center there is a relationship and the relationship is, really experienced how the how they, there is an interplay between the two and that's again where i like to overlaid a potted plant because that one can show that relationship that relationship a little bit better i, think at the moment because the plant says hey i'm not feeling well or whatever i need help the pot soil circle the great warehouse says okay and by law it passed the feedback, i like to take it from the roots because my plant is hopefully open rooted, the, nutrients come deeper and i like to slurpee them up the plant really intake them not an idea i, ah, i pumped the pump read something don't mind me i go into my heavy-duty warrior crazy guy here hey anyway, uh so that gives me a little better flavor for what you were talking about by doing the potted plant format yeah that i might not pick up with the terrain, and who am i and who am i there'll be some but it won't be as clear for me as the potted plant format of really eating up those nutrients as the plant would do and grow bigger stronger prettier longer lasting whatever thank you yeah cover, uh how are we doing how are we doing sensei it's justin i, would like to say um just to, build on what we're talking about here about here that it, seems like as we settle and open to finer levels uh we become more available for the nutrients that are in the terrain around us um we become more available and we can then absorb and utilize more of what's there yeah okay availability for me becomes a factor or question yeah okay uh you just said something important let me get my map right okay say at bobby's level okay, and he says help but i won't suddenly on that first beat suddenly be the greatest guy in the state, or the country but i but i peace out of time here get the flavor of it, uh, so you've got your center calling out to the circle you're circle responding back center improving a bit checking himself out himself herself whatever and saying hey and that's next and that beat continues and to move along dimensionally there by continuing to easy the eye settle and open so on that form the form that we're talking about right now you settle into a finer dimension and you continue that beat but in the finer dimension uh your call offs are a little bit better and the retort from the warehouse is a bit better yeah it's got to be more fast that pay here i am kind of thing because you're at a better level where that can work better, level where that can work better okay, a tighter smaller too much identity that way i'm gonna slow it down i'm gonna interfere with it i'm gonna stop it oh not me oh not me this is for him but not me oh no he, did, judo when he was a kid not me but him, because he did judo what that's what are you talking about come on this is everybody for everything you want to be a better healer boom do your pattern you want to be a better puncher boom do your pattern better actress boom do your pattern everything's cool okay see spiritual people oh no uh you gotta sell candles and insects no man sell a second-hand car oh that's not nice secondhand cards that's not spiritual they've just stopped the whole from happening with that spiritual stupidity excuse me but spiritual stupidity spiritual nonsense it's here it's available it wants to work that way as you upgrade it doesn't matter what you started with it'll become its pure form even second-hand car sales will have a much better purer form if you do your beats so, it's not just only those guys because they're catholic or those guys could know whatever oral sensitivity you all can do this you know uh you just gotta catch on how it works, then you gotta work it when he said keep training he didn't mean keep doing those damn neatos sorry for you i get up people but keep training the beats the beats and whatever style beat you're using keep training the beats and if you want to while you're doing the beat you want to do a check hold it a moment at this level let me check my tennis hit let me check my techniques let me check how i'm doing with two attackers, let me check by swimming laps and keeping time on it or whatever that's fine but just as a check then come back to your interior work hit another level you feel pretty good okay pause and you try your techniques whatever they may be okay did you follow that because i, think i said something cool there but yeah anyway, uh help, i'm trying to feel dispersed help me out here where the hell are we sheehan chris here from new zealand hey you chris are you just um exploring more of the what you're saying about the pump so you would pump the character to help move to, boost up the terrain or you'd boost up boost up the terrain or you'd boost up the terrain or your pump you're pumped to what i miss at least the character to uh vitalize the, system to get the uh the next dimension or you know actually the next i guess next level but it's not quite the wording i want but you pump the character a better character okay following this pattern, now it doesn't matter oh god am i gonna confuse you all uh you could start with there's a lot of energies now i kind of believe that yes there's a lot of energies let's say okay now in that who am i we just did this, form but i turned it around the other way before i said terrain, terrain now who are you yep okay yep okay we could do the other way around in following that is me, me now what kind of train is there for me how should i function in the world and i used to joke with people there i would say uh maybe you're supposed to shine shoes, and that is even the first couple of levels didn't oh of course not shining shoes is a little demeaning certainly okay not the chinese jews of the meaning but you know uh, uh, that, would be too small in occupation no, i wanna open a shoe store maybe or, design shoes or something would be more appropriate so you can come at it either way i hope i didn't confuse anybody with that, that's great you could be a being and check out the terrain or you can have the terrain and check out the being some have preferences i'm a center type first okay jack what is the circle type first, okay, lauren's a circle type first uh um jesus says he likes to balance and i say fine that's cool now don't forget those who like balance have a tendency of slacking is that the word you use t-shirt you use a good word slacking and yeah i think it was something like that i don't remember exactly what the word was but it was a good word i'll remember it in just a minute then anyway because, usually if you're balanced at a fair level you're superior to everyone else around hey, i'm the best in my club i'm the best in my club i'm the best in the dojo i'm the best in the band whatever, and you tend to hey and just stay there being the best in your neighborhood that kind of thing sensei the word was complacent, i like that word complacent you complacent yeah and that's what happens by the way it's a good word for the astral plane thing i was trying to talk about uh the terrain of an astral plane can really be nice okay but the ability to move along without that peace however you'd say who am i at that level but there'd still be that centered piece okay, uh, will really be interfered with really would be doing yourself a disservice, all right all right [Applause], all right all right throwing out and am i getting lost here where are we since it is asia um, i just wanted to lean back into the thing that chris was saying and he was and he was i think when he was looking for the word levels, i would probably say something like layers, so, levels has this kind of thing like there are major jumps but inside the in the terrain, uh there are actually uh what i would call, layers and sometimes they're very fine between, uh one another okay but isn't another word for layer being the next level the next dimension the name you could certainly overlay them yeah and i was just uh i was just uh so you just wanted to give them a different word for the same thing yeah kinda looking for layers and uh or for levels and i said you know maybe, layers is a is a way of talking about it because we are a community that is that is that is especially in practice that this is not um this has some scholarly aspect to it but it's really based in practice if we don't practice i think justin was saying that too uh you gotta be experiential and doesn't mean yeah and whatever level you're at or zone you're in could be experienced oh i see i understand i'm out of here you're gonna screw up yeah you overlay the you start to overlay the things that you already know or from a from a previous um layer and you start to overlay knowledge into experience that you don't have uh words for yet and rather than just be in the experience of that of that space of the new terrain you're already trying to figure it out and gotta double check because the awareness factor is so predominant [Music], not just in the in the states not just in this dimension i'm bumping into it with beings in finer dimensions, this is an ancient from the beginning problems, aware of and missing the experiential of right just for whatever reason happened you jumped the gun maybe we all jumped the gun oh wow look at that and that's it and we didn't realize wait a where and an experience and then the combination enters in more properly so something like that we won't go into that because at the beginning of creation and it's beyond our pay scale at the moment but something like, that heavy proponents in awareness of and so as a dimension opens of one of the major ways as the next dimension opens you're sort of aware of it follow me teacher so you can add or change settle get another dimension and my visual sense of it oh it's a bit lighter and brighter light and bright yeah, yeah, a lot of white things there yeah whatever they are yeah aware of it now the next piece okay let me experience and again let me experience and again more egg oh there and there i'm starting to feel touched and my sense experience is starting to really feel touched uh and i think i mentioned before the one to five awareness is pretty fast whoa look at that yeah but to get the experience i say one to five which might be one to ten or one to twenty for god sakes but that means this part of experience is a little bit slower, doesn't mean it's dumber doesn't mean it's dumber doesn't mean it's beneath the awareness it's just different, it's just different and we haven't yet integrated it yet i think that one of the takeaways from this evening is as the character moves into the new terrain um, that take the taking the time in there rather than uh already knowing what, this is yes take the time to be in it to soak in it to, uh to kind of listen to it in a certain way without pre-knowing what it what it is or what it has to give you yeah, uh sort of don't know what it is to feel it for a while actually you got to feel it you got to choke in it and watch out for that awareness because there's a place i tried to explain this a little bit uh maybe a couple weeks ago or something with the bathtub right you get you see the bathtub and it's steamy and oh i know it's warm but you haven't sat in the bathtub and it's a mineral bath you, haven't gotten any of those minerals you get a little closer oh you feel the steam and feel the moisture from the steam oh i've experienced it not yet people don't be too damn fast there it's an ancient problem take your time now begin to experience it you put one toe in the bath easy oh i can feel that yes one toes work, you continue remember one to five one to ten one to twenty whatever easy experience, experience instead just like going into a hot bathtub slow and slow until you're fully there fully, enjoying fully uh being affected by the minerals of that tub sure is that is that a right way to say yeah you like that yeah, yeah so those of you are fast with the awareness yay for you but come on you missed the other half hard to really move along properly if you keep missing the other half i don't want to scare you but in a certain form it might turn on you a certain bit and you won't know what the hell it is easy settle deeper looks like easy settle deeper oh this isn't this is this is fertilizer oh easy settle more oh my god nutrients and you haven't finished there's more there with that once you catch that it won't be able to scare you because if you don't sit on it with and get some experience, you could be all happy and bright like suddenly is being thrown at you in great amounts and you won't know what to do with it so i'm trying to give you i don't know a heads up a bit better how it works so you don't get confused along the way really thrown off so have some working um practice with quote the underworld okay, it's not just commies are there in all of this in all of it but hit the under because it's, it's, not been, approached as full as it could be okay we paid lip service to a bit oh uh oh uh i do i don't i don't fall over i'm centered, yeah, okay step two you came into the dojo stumbling a bit no you don't stumble as much you got a little bit of center you're not finished so i made jokes at you, tennis players don't usually fall over they're centered why are you any better than them okay the golfer doesn't swing and collapse, he's kind of centered what makes you any better than them so yeah but that's just the beginning of this journey of center circle or the, on growing at the ongoingness of the of the addition sign into finer and finer here and now dimensions i said say it's mike sure, um, tj kind of um well didn't steal my word but it was the was the word that um i'd also come up with in terms of what you've been saying is that it's important that we don't get complacent, that, we don't think we've got it got it or that we've arrived or that this is as far as we can go there is always more it's a continuing journey it's an endless journey, it's an endless journey basically, not endless, but yes in a certain way, yeah i don't i don't mean that in a there's a negative um connotation to that and i don't mean it in that way but just it's a journey that we can't see the final destination no but you get a sense of something you know i hear it's beautiful i hear it's like wow big time wow, you can't imagine a wow of it with anything that you've experienced kind of thing so we have sort of a you know returning back to an original god but in its original format kind of thing so you have some you've heard some stories about how it might be you're on the 20 i don't know your sports but you're on the 20-yard line but you know there's a goal post but you practice at the 20-yard line till you get to the 30-yard line you still know there's a goal post but that's where you are and you practice there to get to the whatever did you follow that i thought that was cute enough you're right um but yeah the basics are uh get a good training pattern and, train, practice essentially train with the internal training internal training, okay so whatever form you're going to use and be prepared to change forms sometimes you get it i've had forms in the past i don't remember now it goes back pretty far historically but where i have a good pattern and after a year or whatever suddenly, it would like disappear and there'd be another one there that i'd pick up on but that was my favorite for that year and i was doing good with that and there's a little perplexedness when that happened but now i kind of kind of i don't know again i don't remember those little years sometimes but uh but, yeah it's like it's like the system is saying nado you've done enough of that form now it's time to change forms in a short period of time i pick up another form and stay with that one for a year or two and then similar thing would happen to be a different form uh so that used to happen to me i forget all the details that goes too far back in history but uh yeah so do be prepared for or purposely, change, change to form sometimes you know uh you know do your chanting form on mondays and your center pump whatever form on tuesdays and go back to channing on wednesdays and you know whatever your basic training even in bodybuilding we don't work the same muscle all the time with the same exercise it gets kind of stale so you change it you get a bar where your hands are turned out a bit more and then you curl this little change affects the bicep a bit they're different okay the undo barbell you just do dumbbells and you do them sitting instead of standing and on and on and on it's kind of if you've ever trained it's kind of basic training okay so find a pattern and train we did the chanting one with the center circle the way we used uh, yeah, yeah, we did two sounds ah your call ah to the o, responds back to the ah better centered i, o responds better because it's a partner it responds better with oh you can take a pause and say okay let me check myself out here it's a centered character plan check yourself out fine now again continuing ah to the o and o to the ah that's your practice pattern so practice not two minutes practice if you're really interested you'll find periods of time where you can stay with it for a while whatever a while it's half an hour an hour, okay now and then i don't want to get dead now and then in tokyo uh i would take uh a whole day plus for time 12 hours whatever and sit and just forget what i was just sitting just like basic meditation but just going long term with it continuing long term with that thing uh that's not something i'd wanted to every weekend uh my wife wouldn't have cared that much for it uh but uh now and then yeah it was it was it was it was kind of interesting kind of i got something out of it okay oh my god we ate up our time really, where's it go thank you for hanging out any less quickies because we ate up time anything autumn how are you doing good dealing with some nutrients um i think uh i have a kind of a question but i'm still formulating it so be patient with me, the, the character is, it emerges when it's clear enough right, and what emerges the character emerges the eye is clear enough when the terrain if you've got a tight eye you can't get a new character because you're already pregnant you can't get pregnant, you can't get pregnant it's a dumb story i used to throw out it's brilliant if people feel it out if you're pregnant you can't get pregnant they're already impregnated themselves with a lesser eye so nothing can happen okay yes i'm sorry go ahead and, then, the, nutrients that come in i guess i'm wondering how to how to really how do you know when they've been fully absorbed is that when you're testing it with one hand or is that when you, will fully absorb say full at that level but now if you want to go another dimensional level there's fuller at that level a bobby absorbs let's say 10 pounds in fact we use 10 20 30 pounder bobby's a 10 pounder if he absorbs 10 pounds he's a full bob he's still a bobby but he's bobby at bobby's best if he trades in easy does a pattern then there's robert who's a 20 pounder and there's nourishment there to fully nurse a 20 pounder so it's, kind of comes up yeah cool thank you yeah thank you okay people time thank you thank you for hanging out i hope you got something out of that one that one uh anyway just don't confuse the terrain with the whole picture trains nice beautiful your dimension inside's finer beautiful, you're not finished there's something more to be done there there's something more to be done there okay thank you thank you sir thank you thank you

good evening spencer hey, hang on before i speak greg what's to come, we're 27, i guess i guess we can begin okay i thought last week uh i enjoyed that i thought it went well i like that sense of uh three different people in the healing trade but with different aspects uh but what i heard was how they had their basics and they went another level could see sense work better and they went another level could see sense work better, uh and each one i believe said that uh so that was nice uh and it's like uh that's sort of it a certain way you've got your job your career uh and to be able to settle whatever form you're using to get to a better level of view where the energies are better so things function better more harmonious whatever uh that's sort of the game uh, in aikido that's the game supposedly also, uh, i, it's possible that a lot of the inner better level of yourself has been omitted, or people do a little bit and then go out there more and more and more and sort of forgot what the, more of the inner is would be my, anyway any comments on last week can you carry over rah-rah talk you can open mic feel free to speak what'd you get out of last week well i'll start off sensei this is lauren i, found it a really lively discussion and i was impressed by the consistency of the, insight from the three different people that but uh that was my first impression and i'm sure other people had more to say we're waiting for them to say something hello out there you could always just call on somebody yes, uh what did you say danny, hey danny good to see you again um yeah last week's class was very enjoyable i um it was interesting listening to the three people i guess on the other side of what i'm doing i'm receiving help in a medical way and in particular at the moment with acupuncture and with someone who very much works with me and she deepens the level that she's working at whilst i deepen the level that i received and um and i use the system the system that you've been showing a sense of self and the domain and i've found that um first of all very encouraging for me as a person that i can work in a really positive way with um my own healing and another particular interest is how i feel self and, and, how it communicates back to me as i dialogue with it and request the help of the healing self um, in my recovery um, and also and also the remarkable thing that i find about it is that it's so every time i'm engaging or i get that deeper part of myself how different it is every time and, um in, particular how it looks and how it receives me [Music] and how i'm affected by a very um very strong way in, often i feel pulled away like into my head and i'm always reminded to deepen and deepen as you suggest and feel and the feeling part of it is most enlightening to the depth of feeling that i'm able to experience and, i would say that my healing is not going as i would like it to go however, the feedback from other people lots of other people is that you're looking great and you're doing really well so better their feedback than mine i think sometimes, if, yes it's normal that you're the last one to know so either those people are lying to you which is a possibility but do be prepared for you're the last one to, know i mean if somebody says wow you're really being nice lately to me for example i admit really because i'm the last one to know if there's such a change also you use the words pulled out from this inner dot uh pulled out i, might also say pushed out because this inner is more closer to a source of more everything power for example uh it has a lot of push ability so i kind of would consider that more of being a pushed out so i've got to hit it better and fuller and experience it more or anchor for like the words don't know if that's a good word but to anchor there at that level okay if you keep hovering around saying well i'm talking to myself you might be hovering around and pinging it bushes to, the self is experiencing itself so after a bit i would stop maybe talking to self and feel what an experienced self which is me experiencing itself kind of thing uh, i don't know is it talking to itself i don't know but to talk to it put you on a, spiral around it that'll be easier to get kicked off so to beat it feeling itself experiencing itself and yes it's dialoguing there with itself kind of thing i don't know if i said that well at all but yeah that's right thank you uh is florida diane on tonight i'm sorry sensei linda had her uh hand raised okay hi there not diane was surprised, to see myself pop up um thank you yeah this was a, small thing from last week but it really struck me one of the things that got me thinking of things in a little different way is when you i believe it was you we're talking about um how we, have too many spiritual rules about like prerequisites and step wise we have to be a perfectly loving person before we can whatever um you know that there's, a there's a it's uh so prescribed we can't just go bam and, change something or become aware of something, so i've been just noticing that yeah, no i think it's a again a human condition where uh those rules uh whatever the right word is for that uh can be a hindrance a certain way so to come to better terms with them i'm lacking words about that at the moment but uh but yeah that's why i throw up my old story the guy you know i'd like to meditate but my understanding is you have to be loving to meditate i mean that's it being no nado allowed here which turned out to be uh but there was that belief i must have heard it from some place read it someplace and it was keeping me out or sit on the right kind of cushion or whatever sit this way yeah, yeah, so, whatever yeah so thank you that sort of opens things up, it'd be subtle it should be so it's there it's you it's yours yeah, yeah, anyway, thank you thank you thank you again is uh florida diana, she's not here sensei and out here someone else has their hand raised okay you're on ken uh hi bob hey uh yeah i um uh actually throughout the years um i've had experiences where um i've had uh you know healings happen on these different levels that, you talked about in the you know uh even though that was the model you know i realized that wasn't the whole thing that you were talking about um, but uh but uh i, it i, it sort of reminded me uh that it's possible that we, feel unwell for some reason and maybe there's a maybe you're not eating the right food you know maybe there's a simple, biological cause and maybe you've tweaked your something doing something but maybe the symptoms coming from a more subtle level and, that might be the place to go look for um i remember a julian silverman uh who was the boss of wesleyan for a while and he really liked the word dis ease i love that word i love it i'm gonna do it say it with that flavor and i got to like the word too uh so at, ease we could say it's being sort of squared away in harmony with to whatever level and disease is when you're not you're not and i, kind of like that word or that sense of that word yeah right so you know these days they talk about not pathologizing everything you know you don't have to make it into a an illness a pathology you have some discomfort some dis-ease and, you know investigate it see what you can do about it that's true i don't we do that a lot with if someone's really off uh and mentally off too they start to that they, want to be a medical term because they're feeling screwed up and somebody will come up with a medical term for it and you know now it's suddenly a heavy duty something well now we can give them a yeah but really now we can give them a pill for it once we have them oh and then that's it the follow-up guys oh let's make a buck on this one yeah okay pathetic anyway human condition people human condition sad, indeed okay, um, anything else before we talk about one by two by three bite again tonight no that's it okay what to say about one by two by uh a couple of people i, like appreciate their view and stuff really like the one by two by three by uh, i always thought it was kind of cool and uh to get some feedback from a couple other guys that i, appreciate their sense of things and they thought it was really cool uh so let's hope you all think there's something there for you uh, oh i'm gonna stand up after a bit on the one by i, really want to remind you to, feel to feel we're gonna box ourselves in there a bit i want you to actually feel the one bye not just say okay let's see it's a it's a smaller space what should i think what should i make out about this as i you know feel it experience it and one reason i would like you to really feel a one by limitation, is uh let's say in daily life we get pushed into a tighter level of ourselves from a robber to a bobby to beginning to be a weird bobby that i recognize that as soon as possible so i don't go too far too where i'm really crazy uh and this has been mentioned before where i try to get you to, feel an energy push you so you sort of recognize when, you're being pushed a bit because the push is gonna not just be physical but it's gonna spin you off into certain train of thought and further out and weirder so to actually experience the limitations of a one by that can give you a warning buzzer i need a word help me with the word harry, huh an alarm and an alarm that you're starting to get a little boxed in there and like my old phrasing don't sign a contract if you find yourself get anywhere nearer one by one do not have a heart to heart with your spouse, do not drive faster you know dumb stuff like that so to recognize where you are on this lineage of bobby robert natto or in this case a one by a two by which is a fair day sort of three buy which is not a bad day hey it's a good day uh kind of pattern uh if we have time tonight i'd like to slip in a four by uh, last time we did one two three buy like to sleep in a four by if we have time ah in, bringing that up did any anybody out there, who has done the one by two by three by class last year when we did it um, get sort of an excitement oh boy we're gonna do a four-by did anyone get anything like, that absolutely i, can't remember the last time i saw a four-by then to throw a wet blanket over our friday night party here i have to say i introduce one by two by three by as a general direction and a simple pattern that i found pretty simple and useful and other people found it simple and useful uh that you were free this last year to do a for by to do a five by nobody stopped you, had the pattern you had one two three, then you do four you have a four then you can do a five uh so i want to throw a bit of a wet blanket over you guys who got excited and said and said people it's been there all for a whole year did you yourself do a four so the i just wanted a that's all that's all right you okay with that kenny i'm, so glad to help you thank you yeah okay ah i'd say i'd say 1 by 2 by 3 by 4 remember that's basically just a dimensional approach, uh, certain, level dimensionality things are a little heavier so i'm heavier the world around me started to show heavier that's how i see it finer dimension we're calling it two by it's just dimensionality and it's here and now and we have different ways of moving into it we can settle, we can clear we can trade in we can down time and then the next is light again to be at that next level and if it takes you uh, some minutes on that trade-in or changing from uh one to a two to two to a three uh, you'll get better at it faster with it uh i thought we did pretty fast last year i'm just tromping through a one by two by we what we used for reference was actual stepping uh tonight i might we'll do that pattern of stepping for one and two uh on three i might change the pattern and, not use stepping but to remind you about we could downtime this we could trade, two in when you trade in the whole world of two three is beginning to show or whatever forms of uh, that you like that we've sort of covered right letting go trading in uh, clearing on and on and on so find your own comfortable forms uh blah, anybody anything before uh, uh i stand up and we do a uh one bite to start anything, it's cool down here tonight nothing again zilch nada instead of going up to just sort of see what's happening with myself if i'm upset or something's going on within me go into the negative you know from one to half to quarter not quite that fast so that's good i'm gone man i'm crazy man i don't go that tight well i did slice slight thinner but it was quite interesting and then sort of to know that you can shift out it was quite nice yes, no when i introduced this uh to my uh had a group of therapists in la for a long period of time i think we had a monthly classes ongoing for a year, and a half i don't remember, uh but they loved tightening and tightening it and they got to experience their own style of insanity they loved that game that game and they all recognized their own style of insanity they were versed enough in their own craziness with oh yeah that's me i'm crazy uh again and the ability of getting out of there, going back to sanity and a bit better yeah that's cute thank you yeah, i noticed mine changed i checked it out for a moment the other day my old one tightening and tightening and tightening, and tightening and tightening it i'm paranoid or whatever i'm paranoid uh i, did one the other day that tightening and tightening and it was something else i, don't remember right now to go over it again it wasn't that important for me but just i just noticed oh this is not that one it's so, i've changed through the years uh whatever, okay it was a different kind of insanity of potentiality i'm blank on what it was right now okay standing we are uh we got a new microphone so check it can you hear me okay here you find someone say thank you fine okay, easy get ready to feel thinking, and if nectar probably thinking about feeling that thinking aspect is tricky no actual feeling and i figure i'm thinking about actual feeling a bit actual, feeling okay now here's our setup one step boom and there's a wall here one step and there's a wall here corresponding wall here and here and a ceiling, here, okay, so in the middle of that, and the energies that are there that's all that exists that's all you get, there is no more right now you cannot think your way out of this about, how nice it is in hawaii or whatever this is it people you're in a one by one the energies available to you the qualities that are within those energies energy's qualities for me are about the same the qualities that are there are your quality so everybody could be a bit different in their one by one because their qualities are different the energies qualities that are there mix up you a character person okay so in this sense it's mixing up some level of a body okay feel yourself the energies are mixing you up breathe yourself feel yourself again it's a limited amount we're in a one by one for example first things i'm noticing uh a hesitancy i'm not sure even physically if you ask me to step out strong or hit the line i can't really do it if i do it it'll be half-assed, i'll do it in a hesitant manner i'm not sure, that's mine what's your sense of anything here as we mix up a little bit better a person you in a one by one situation or one by one world one by one world fear your body i know it's so hard to straighten up for, me there's a starting to be a stronger catch in my back, i kind of prefer here believe it or not this feels strange it's a strain i sort of can't do it very well or i don't want to do it this is natural hey, hi how are you and i doubt if i would smile as a one by one feel yourself the energies mix up you character feeling yourself okay i, noticed my foot planning is not well i sort of staggered a second ago i didn't make that up i the sense of having deeper feet or anything like that is beyond me this is the fact right here i'm sort of sort of staggering on the surface brad my uh first my joints are a little stiff okay don't move i'm gonna move okay but it's not you know great um, like i said just, stiff okay, cold frozen joints okay you know yourself feeling yourself feeling yourself what's your view of a situation like your view of the world or a situation what's your what's bobby's view what's your bobby's view you're a one by one it's the way things are and i can't do anything about it it's not gonna get any better it just yeah it is the way they are why bother is not going to get any better, just the way they are yeah okay i would tire out fast i can feel that i don't have good endurance here in any sense of the word insurance you're one by one it's interesting how my tummy is kind of pulling in and this part is pouring into his whole range it just keeps pulling in that way i'm going to be getting begin to doubt my manhood talk about it open mic okay [Music] it's a miracle i could ever get past one by because the one by guy is pissed off annoyed and doesn't want to do anything he says just leave me alone and just be pissed i think every neighborhood has, one guy or one person that lives in a one by one, just don't bother him he's pissed all the time at everybody for anything right, right you got him there he is so again i wanted you to feel uh some of the physical things so if they ever hit you during the day if i feel myself being pulled in or slouching overly well katya will get on my case but anyway uh anyway uh i'd like to catch it before i get too far so that's why i wanted you to really feel not just think about this stuff but to feel it and then there'll be thoughts of a one by one naturally there but to just have thoughts about them without the feeling it's not a good habit even in a one by one okay so more feeling about it so you'll recognize it if we ever get squashed into that level or anywhere near it okay open mic somebody uh since this is lauren yes and i'm just gonna add my spotlight here uh just uh just uh by contrast to steve who just described how, the one by one steve is uh pissed off the one by one lauren felt like a, victim like no options to get out of the way of anything, and uh and uh you know whatever was going to happen couldn't uh couldn't dodge it couldn't uh, you know maneuver and so that felt like you know didn't like that feeling at all yeah it's equally distasteful but it's completely different from what steve described yeah i, also i didn't think to do it tonight but to ask the aikido people as a one by one what techniques they wouldn't do if they were in fact could make it to the mat and an example with lauren would be no ski no fast ski because i can't get out of the way and you know and it's always been a challenge for me and uh ah he's carrying a touch of one by one the other thing i wanted to share was that, i felt that when we did this the first time last year we were all in lockdown and it the one by one we felt like i felt like we were living in a one by one and the exercise as we went to two by two and three by three which produced such a sense of relief and expansion without any change in the physical reality or constraints of daily life it was really you know you know instructive really, instructive really, instructive and so uh and so uh we're not so physically confined anymore but i think it still uh really works i can't change that i can change me yes, yes it ah yeah, perhaps someone else has something to add yeah somebody this is patrick hey patrick hi yeah my physical experience of a one by one me was my chest got tight and it was more difficult to breathe and as far as how i relate to situations i didn't want to be bothered i just wanted the problem or whoever it was coming to me to go away and leave me alone, yeah, yeah i remember i think from last year i wouldn't pick up the phone you know if the phone rang i wouldn't want to pick it up because i don't want to hear anything or deal with anything so i can relate yeah thank you patrick yeah that sensei this is tom i, feel as i'm concur with patrick and my experience even today was catching myself, if i was holding my breath as if i wasn't breathing and i'm standing over a task and i and i'm standing over a task and i suddenly take a huge gasp of the air in and realize for the last minute i wasn't really breathing and that's the one by one that i that i often feel yeah so again trying to give people a, warning sign if you like to use breathing as any kind of daily reference whatever uh to notice if it starts to get that way knowing it's going to get that way uh let you know you're heading too tight careful, and if you can move into a better level if you can't be careful okay, just know it's not the ultimate reality but you're stuck there for a bit that's fine just be careful i didn't say it was great you're gonna have fun there but just be careful maybe time to just watch a dumb movie okay well sensei this is lauren again if i could just jump on that, it's my personal experience that uh when i get wound up i will tilt forward and, not only if i'm walking but if i'm in a you know a meeting or something i'll get that very distinctive collapse just like you described and it's a tell for me that i'm getting into a one by and, if i take that moment and simply stand up, or straighten up and one breath will actually change my attitude and my sense, so it's not just that when you move to the two by you get to feel like you're standing up more but if you stand up more it helps move you to a two-by okay my own experience yeah uh these moves can get faster that sounded like a faster form or something they, should be able to get faster with these things, we okay on a one by no one of you gina yes gina this was so much more intense than last year i mean i almost started crying immediately i felt so trapped, and my skin hurt and then it started to go deeper i don't think i've ever felt like this life is scary life is scary whoa i'm not going back there kenny and i were talking about what kenny was talking about uh, something about what you said about the, skin uh kenny weren't we talking about something about tighter disease kind of things tighter illness um yeah, yeah so i thought hers was interesting that the skin itself actually yeah i got to go to a skin doctor no you don't lady you got to get out of the one by one first we'll go further than that we'll talk tap deeper finer so it can radiate out through and within that is a healing potential, so different topic another time but okay are we all right on one by one should we move into a two by two thank god a two by two okay uh let's walk uh let's walk a two by two okay so there we are ah okay one two click okay, one two click on there okay walls a little bit more here see a little bit a little bit more okay two by two, by two okay stand up for a bit there's a little more energy in the two by two it mixes you character body feel yourself the energy's hair feel yourself two by two amount of energies feel yourself already notice i'm breathing better for deeper my chest feels a little chestier and it tells me i can serve be positive out there certain amount of positiveness these are mine yours are yours, two by two mixes up me as a two by twoer little change of name i don't like bobby so much here feel yourself as a true mind you feel yourself oh my foot uh connection is deeper through the ground remember my one i was staggering, on top of the surface here i have a little bit of depth of foot feel yours feel yourself a little more back up [Applause], got some back support if we're doing a walk under pressure right now right now my two by two he's not fantastic but he's not bad he's, not bad as you back up almost through not quite a flow yet but getting close feel yourself feel yourself you're not perfect that's why i call it a, fair day bad day fair day now we have degrees depends on how you're playing it could be a good fair day or a fair, day your, call as to where you're at feel yourself, pretty good my underpinnings my legs area it's not bad but it could be stronger, it's not bad but i'm aware uh if i were at the gym pumping iron uh i would go it's time to do more leg work, i'd have to do more squats more extension something i want to build this up a bit not quite this, upper part feels much stronger than this part here so if i were barbelling i worked this area heavily this month what's your view of the world or at least the situation you're in or the world what's your what's your view, as, ah two by twoer i, can handle small medium projects i'm not sure how big a project but, normal stuff concern cope with that not necessarily eagerly looking forward to problems but within reason i'm okay as an aikidos uh static techniques or with a little movement techniques a lot of movement like a group attack not quite not quite and i just know i would respond my response wouldn't be great but for basic, basic yeah i did kind of do that got a sense of yourself and a two by two you [Music] okay you, two by two tell me about you two by two definitely ah wider chest better breathing for me what to you yeah bob i had a very similar thing the first thing well the word and the experience came about the same time was confidence you know my chest felt puffed out and, you know i felt like i could handle things, okay yeah okay yeah, so again and daily living if i find my chest compressing if i have a lot of body awareness or it'd be nice if you all had body awareness and you feel something start to compress should clue you in okay something's going on if you can move to a better level if you can or if you can't feel careful no it's, a little bit of this so be a little careful cautious whatever the word is somebody, this is patrick for me my chest was more relaxed i was able to breathe more easily and i found myself just having an exhalation uh, in that relaxation but also a sense of relief that there was more room and as far as my reaction to the situation i felt like there was hope now yes there's a chance for me yes, somebody two by twoer bob go yeah um i found myself turning there were new directions uh in one by one i was stuck was stuck in one place my hands were cold my feet were cold nowhere to go yeah two by two my hands and my feet are warming up i'm turning oh there are directions here i keto on a phone booth at least i've got a phone booth and i don't want to sit the energy's starting to flow okay thank you linda yeah very much the same able to breathe having a little more space and um what really struck me about the first one was how stuck i felt like couldn't like not a lot of potential for anything there, and uh in, two by two it was like oh there's some possibility there's, a little room to, play experiment, yeah grow if we get stuck in a certain level let's say the one by one where uh you can't maneuver out or something maybe sometimes we ought to just live with it if, you're i don't know what words you if you're stuck there just live with it and don't do anything sit down and read a dumb book watch a dumb movie uh you know uh maybe sometimes not to try to fight it fight it i'm not saying this well again tonight uh but uh [Music] live with yourself as best you can if you get to move to a better level great, if you can't for whatever reason don't panic this too will pass there'll be a different beat later or tomorrow hang in there whatever, somebody on a two-by hi sensei this is andrew hey andrew um i feel like i'm looking at the world like a teenager um fresh eyes i forget what that's like could you remind me what that means um, not fully developed i kind of like a wild horse you know you're kind of free but you don't know any limitation you're not squared away at a certain level uh um, like for me at level one i was kind of leaning forward a little bit not fully standing up straight uh level two it this kind of like i feel like i want to stand up straight but it's not quite there yet yeah as i say the different levels some people's two by two will be a little smaller whatever others will they're two by two they want to have it a bit bigger uh but you're allowed leeway in, there so the counts are arbitrary, okay so okay so did i again did i say that right am i speaking clearly tonight that your first move might be first grade to second grade somebody else's first move might be first grade to their third grade it doesn't matter as long as you you're using your own uh system your own measurement you know my measurements mean something to me the bobby robert nada order one two three they mean something to me because, i have a sense of them for me okay, how are we doing people okay so far nothing more on the two two-by uh yo who dat it's tom yeah i felt more, freedom in the two-by just a little more and it's almost like create my own space but i wasn't ready to let anybody else in that space in a two-by-i'm just starting to feel my own sense of self and having some groundings and space below the floor but it's a little tight still to let somebody else since but much better than a one by much better so what tom is saying is he would stay a bachelor a little bit longer than some other guys and there's no set rule right you like three-month gap between the ladies, somebody else likes a six-month gap whatever, so, you know it's your own count deal with yourself okay people oh now on this one instead of walking see what i would hate to happen is let's say we're getting to it a seven by seven and somebody calls me and says sensei i can't do a seven by seven because my living room is too small did you follow my trajectory there, uh ridiculous it's a metaphor kind of thing to step in so instead of stepping with mama said two by two easy two by two okay and whatever your form is a trade in a down time a clearing a letting go of everything of the two by and it all go clear the decks ha, ha and here click is the beginnings of a tree by easy i, fell asleep i did down time i let go from the two by trading it in your own words your own style and, boom in the land of three by this one i'd like to be a little more circular, centered circular instead of the squared away form of two by three by walking well in a three by easy i want to pick up the center first [Applause], then for me the parameters remember i'm a center first guy first center and then parameters now within that screen by again certain amount of energy spiraling around or quality, and they mix me up character feel your body, breathe yourself character move yourself a little bit feel yourself not in a full character three by three mixing, all the energies here in a three by three ah, three by three there ah i feel taller ah my voice is changing i can feel it i can hear it my head neck feels a little straighter cleaner clearer feels like my head's on right whatever that means ah definitely still chest here i almost want to ask brad to punch me in the chest a bit it three by three i'm character feel myself me hips are getting stronger still more under there but much better than a 25 i don't know if i'm ready to do sumo yet but, getting close getting close [Applause] okay feel yourself if you're 90 knows what would be comfortable techniques in an ipo class for you for example ignore what your sense of situation or the world you're in ah feel yourself what's your take what's your sense ugh brad ranch for some of yours talk to him yep, now what about yours yep okay so um in my 3x3 i had a new uh um, experience um i really felt like it when i was one by whatever i was hanging on to that was causing issues um you know whatever was holding me up i felt like i didn't have a space in the one bite one bite but when i stepped into the three by um i really felt like there was ample space to you know whatever baggage i was carrying in the earlier dimensions um you know i was able to just let it go um and you know there was space and, so you know in terms of the other attributes and um other uh you know points uh was able to uh that was all available to me um you know which is which is nice experience but you know when people say to say to relax you know at the earlier levels like i couldn't relax and it just wasn't possible but you know once you hit three there was plenty of space to let go and really place to put all your baggage and move on so um anybody else have other experiences and brad you're asking for other people to speak up yes, brad linda esken again hi um what i noticed first along with just physically having more space was the sense that i had a little bit extra to give like i maybe could support someone i could be a little i had a little bit extra to offer to others thank you linda danny here yes stanley there um i found um because you encouraged us to um settle or um let go of um, i hadn't done that from level one to level two and i, i now know that i had level one mixed up with not level sorry that's our covert levels, um and i was quite unstable yeah, having let level uh two and one go i had a strong willingness to walk and the confidence and when i did take the three steps i felt like they were probably the best three steps i've taken, in the last three months which is really exhilarating and um, i've felt myself filling with lots of energy and then my arms started to swing um, in quite an unusual way swinging to the front of myself and it was very, enjoyable and i looked forward to every step um yeah my outlook was much brighter quick story on the arm swinging so i'm in the marine reserves i'm 17 uh and we're marching and the sergeant sips into the, squad whatever the group was in school a bigger group and apparently i'm when i'm marching i got one arm active and the other one is not activating and he just moved my arm because a marine would be more present squared away at least a three by three and his arms would work that way if you've got one arm and a dead arm you're not a marine yet you're a two by twoer no two by two words allowed in the core anyway uh but what you said about carrying a two-by into the land of three by clouds the issue uh that's almost a whole topic on um but again isn't that why we clear, and really clear so that the next stage set i kind of think of it like a curtain closing and then the next stage set is there and it's a three by three stage that it's a better stage set um, that if i still have uh furnitures and or decor from scene two scene two and now it's seeing three but that same furniture is theirs and supposed to be an outdoor scene it's screwy it's it can't figure this out wait a minute it's supposed to be in a park with a park bench what's that three sectional couch doing there and the tv set in the park no way uh so yeah we confuse uh things but uh i, think also i was in a hurry to leave that one by one oh i definitely wasn't happy there i understand that um a lot of time my one by one uh area is i don't know and i hate not knowing so i understand that ah that's, how it affects me anyway we okay so far anybody else sensei this is patrick i found myself um with three feeling much freer to move and moving in ways that weren't planned or intentional just, moving around and really enjoying that you know not having any agenda for the movements just letting them come naturally and with a sense of flow yeah, and then with respect to the situation i found myself being more willing to engage, beyond myself [Music], so, in the dating world patrick you got to be a three by three no less no less no less you ain't gonna make it out there in the world patrick you know that now though you got that down right yeah ah it's a discussion patrick and i have some time about anyway ah, oh and also what he said about that freer movement there's a place in nike where it may not be heavy group attack but you got a few folks moving around you and it's a light group attack and where you got no agenda you're just enjoying the movement and freed or whatever is what i felt there yeah, yes okay you want to try a 4x4 we've got a couple minutes i think we can do that yeah let's try it out that's gonna be interesting that'll be interesting okay, okay again let's not walk it all right three by three pretty good pretty good now some people are afraid to move on to a four by four because they're afraid they'll lose that the three by three will get lost they don't have a good enough sense that it's sort of for me i call it impossible uh that if you like three bike you're gonna love four buy i just trust the system of finer definer finer heading towards a more original and more original it's perfect as hell uh i don't have any trouble i don't think uh letting go of a certain level to get to another level but in the human condition we do have that problem a lot of guys get so good at a certain level, to do any kind of letting go of that or trading that in they're really afraid because they got so much going on for them at this level did i say that right again okay so why don't people continue and continue, those things will prop up for some people, i know this is good enough thank you no more, is not an unexpected reaction in the human condition so three pie some form of trading in year four [Music] clearing your form i like more depth because it's a fuller picture and i'll give it a shot and here is a floor by world you might sort of check it should be a center there clear circumference there semi, uh but not full enough yet i'll hit it again feels brighter there's a lot of twinkling going on in here i put it in the body what's going on with the body feel, it feel hey that's a little bit of vibrancy uh for me you know energy flow stuff will be ping pretty, easy feel, feel [Applause], feeling before thinking feeling, feeling, feeling, you'll be knowing finer energies mix up fuller finer character feel yourself there's a spring in my step potential i can feel a bounce [Applause] if we have a jumping contest you know how high we can reach or something, i'd be kind of interested in that right now feel yourself perfection of techniques when am i practicing detailing detail something like that feel yourself feel yourself four by four by four centered and circled, and centered, feel yourself, four by four begin that time i won't say brilliance not brilliant yet but that sparkly feeling and i feel it through my eyes or sparkling a bit i feel like almost like i'm feeling an aura or uh like glowing a bit i walk into a room and i'm uh dating every time i'm dating uh i feel like somebody there i don't notice is not a b going out just radiating out a bit i feel bigger than i normally feel you don't told me reminding me how little i weigh i feel some temporary surprise really that's all i weigh i feel what are you guys getting yeah i'm going to call that for me temporarily the sparkling zone or sparkling level ah hey sensei i, really like this one um well you should this is where i feel like you know in some techniques where the energy is flowing out of my fingers it's flowing beyond me it's like an energy arm or um, yeah it yeah it this is i think this is my favorite [Laughter], five is better but okay [Laughter], don't going there going to get there yeah sometimes we try to teach people to do things when they're in a one and a half by a one and a half and they can't do them because it's not done at one and a half it's done at a three by or a four by that's when it can begin to happen okay so teaching them more little details about how to do something it's not too cool help them to get more squared away first yeah, yeah but get more squared away so that they're at the level where those things can happen see to go the other way around i throws me people it throws me anyway somebody uh sensei this is dennis hey dennis uh you know i just realized this is the first time that uh i actually uh have smiled in the past couple of days, i just kind of caught myself like wow i'm smiling as i'm sitting back down here i don't want to tell you your wife called me the other day and mentioned that that's why we're doing this oh yeah thank you for days uh, you know there's there was a big there was a big jump for me between one and two, because again you know the last couple days i was really just holding on to and really tight and uh but before that i felt uh a lot more physical support coming from behind and on from underneath uh and uh it felt uh just a lot of a lot of support that there was there was something there that okay all right i'm liking people can you see how nice this is to, go from a place where uh there's virtually nothing one by one kind of thing to a place where you're just naturally being supported if you've got your own support it's, always been there we just haven't been there at that level that dimension of you where it's there and it's available it's not like we had to do a lot of work in a one by to get this to happen yeah we started there yeah we experienced it for a moment we moved along well we're always free to move along learn a few tricks you can move along faster fuller boom um get this mix to happen quicker it's almost can be a shazam kind of thing uh feel it fuller do it fuller feeling fuller and the treasures we call it that the treasures that are there the treasures of support the treasures of confidence the treasures of uh freedom uh the treasures a variety of possibilities like jesus people these things are here for us to me this is very exciting when i first realized my very early times in this work to realize the stuff is here is here like oh my god i couldn't believe it and it was free it was just me touching that place and there it was and basically it was free it was there wow, wow, remember i come from a family of workers you want it you got to work hard for it yeah some hard work and learning how to settle and living with yourself and all of that but not really work it was there and it was free wow, excited the hell out of me and i see people now they don't seem excited they catch something and i say to them wow and they go yeah what's next sensei you got anything else [Music] what the hell i don't know what's with the world what the hell is going on out there somebody go ahead you know bob um you know going back to the three i started to feel a shift almost from, somebody you would say like you're more center than, uh situation uh but with three i was ready to go out into the world i felt a little bit more and then for not only out into the world but like you said there's, this charisma this stuff's coming off of me so that i impact the world without trying yes without trying yes i, sort of wanted to say that and i didn't come up with the words at the moment yeah it's, uh at the party where i'm, looking for lady companionship it's not like you gotta, push on them you know it's, there but it's like without trying you just hit that spot and it's like without trying so in a certain way it's not work i'll say that but yes, thank you cool no excitement in a four by four hi sensei this is andrew again yes andrew, um, give me something good i used i used the wild horse and the teenager metaphor and uh he's now in college and um he kind of feels like he can enter, you know he he's got a lot more confidence he's not as wild but he has the energy i guess more matured um, i keep on picturing like uh it's like uh it's like a night squire trying to earn his ropes to become a knight kind of halfway in between he's not trying to control the horse but he's kind of they're working as a team i don't know that just makes sense to me now it's a, normal good step along the way you know [Music] sensei this is dave from chicago uh from chicago yeah i, would echo the, sort of effortlessness that, comes with the, 4x4 that the 3x3 you feel like you have to do something that it's me doing something 4x4 it's just it's there and, it's going to it's going to impact those around you it's tangible know since i had a little difficulty, getting that exact description across to me, but we did dialogue someplace there about something like this where uh, you don't work and yet obviously i can't even repeat his sense of it but something like we were talking about here it's just sort of happening but it's not you have to work it but some people as it begins to happen go out and sort of work it and then they kind of lose it something like, that uh but it just had trouble with the words of you don't really have to work it but there's something going on but you don't have to work, at it maybe or something uh i'll have to go over my notes again and see if i can get it a bit clearer 4x4 wow give me a wow somebody sensei christine from new zealand the um the um a real awareness of the system like and you're sort of the system's really active really moving you're as a for me sort of physically sort of slightly behind it's you're aware something's moving quicker than you or not quicker but ahead of you um and it's wanting to do stuff it's active it's alive i, felt that when i put my hand out that there's a moment there where uh it felt like it was there and then my hand was there but there was something better than that there but there's i had a sense of something there before i went there hard to describe but yeah i got your drift, thank you christ and say this is patrick um for me the physical on four was that i found myself having a downbeat and then in being in an upbeat a down flow and then there being an up flow from underneath the ground that felt as though it was filling me up and making me have a little bit more power and as far as the situation goes i found myself, kind of being willing to invite people to engage me you know i started one by one with leave me alone don't bother me i've got my own problems, and this time i felt like oh i welcome you coming and talking with me oh i started a form that i use patrick where my down time hits a certain spot and from that spot the next lifetime if you would or the next dimensional world that i'm in the 4 4x4 thing, so it's not just me the character it's me and the world the center and the circle the circle and the center it encompasses all of that again not speaking great tonight uh we're getting close to the end here people, anybody all excited about a four-by yes, i yes i got excited about it and i like your use of the word uh treasures and um one of them came to me and that was benevolence um, i felt a too uh a horizontal energy flowing through me backwards and forwards there's greenery around me i'm outside and it felt to me like i was in contact without even, trying to do anything that the natural world was flowing through me and it reminded me of a benevolent world which i haven't thought of or felt for a long time, so i really enjoyed it yeah, remember the inner core of our self truer self truer self uh your qualities are more available and will more readily show or be present be present, uh so benevolence sounds like it might be one of your main ones because it's coming up here so may not be your first one but it's that got to be one of the early ones for you because it's showing here i'm sure it's not too strange you're kind of a good family man as i see you uh so benevolence and being the granddad the daddy the boss man there i'm sure that's there so not your first go around on that sense of things okay people we ate up our time our time so enjoy next week uh your thanksgiving of course be careful on the road uh check what level you're going to drive from one buy ain't going to be good for anybody to buy yeah i'd up in holiday traffic with uh people being a little crazier i would get to hopefully a three by three level of view driver now at least has a little more outer awareness reacts a bit faster better i'm not asking that much i'm not saying be a five by driver a six by driver we're not at the grand prix here uh but uh but do note it and get some extra practice time in, holiday, traffic, taking that moment that two moments that three moments three by three as a driver okay yeah thank you so much sensei thank you thanks for hanging out i'm going to end with
